look the same to me and then you have

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.040 
look the same to me and then you have
the<00:00:33.270> fish<00:00:33.570> oils<00:00:34.070> from<00:00:35.420> nature<00:00:36.420> made<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.930> was

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the fish oils from nature made that was

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.590 
the fish oils from nature made that was
that<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.320> used<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> take<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> look<00:00:39.480> at

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that I used to take so if you look at

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
that I used to take so if you look at
the<00:00:39.660> difference<00:00:40.079> beneficials<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:40.980> supposed

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the difference beneficials I'm supposed

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
the difference beneficials I'm supposed
to<00:00:41.309> change<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.910> texture<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> color<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to change and texture and color or so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840 
to change and texture and color or so
they're<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.710> supposed<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> freeze<00:00:44.340> over<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
they're not supposed to freeze over and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.799 
they're not supposed to freeze over and
that<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:45.809> they're<00:00:46.020> pure<00:00:46.530> potent<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:48.149> as

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that is if they're pure potent but as

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.479 
that is if they're pure potent but as
you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:50.039> far<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you can see right there as far as the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
you can see right there as far as the
look<00:00:50.670> test<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.030> looks<00:00:51.320> pretty<00:00:52.320> different<00:00:52.590> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
look test it looks pretty different so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.330 
look test it looks pretty different so
I'm<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.190> ahead<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:54.710> I'm<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.890> pull<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
I'm go ahead and I'm gonna pull out a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.939 
I'm go ahead and I'm gonna pull out a
few<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:57.480> each<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> compare<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.770> they

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
few of each and compare them see if they

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
few of each and compare them see if they
change<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.399> color<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.789> texture<00:01:00.469> at<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:02.750> pull

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
change in color and texture at all pull

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100 
change in color and texture at all pull
out<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> each<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> there's<00:01:06.750> more<00:01:06.930> from

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
out one of each so there's more from

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:20.240 
out one of each so there's more from
nature-made<00:01:18.290> I'm<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.439> get<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> white<00:01:19.890> plate

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
nature-made I'm gonna get a white plate

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:35.060 
nature-made I'm gonna get a white plate
put<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> plate<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> if

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
put them on a plate and I think that if

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
put them on a plate and I think that if
you<00:01:35.220> were<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> close<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:35.790> eyes<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.150> now

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you were to close your eyes right now

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.340 
you were to close your eyes right now
and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.570> were<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> put<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.290> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and I were to put these down you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
and I were to put these down you
shouldn't<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.860> able<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> tell<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> difference

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
shouldn't be able to tell the difference

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.880 
shouldn't be able to tell the difference
between<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> freezer<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
between which one was in the freezer and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
between which one was in the freezer and
which<00:01:41.159> one<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.850> we're<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> put<00:01:42.479> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
which one was so we're going to put this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.370 
which one was so we're going to put this
in<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:42.930> light<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:45.079> honestly<00:01:46.079> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
in some more light and honestly you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
in some more light and honestly you
can't<00:01:46.619> tell<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> difference<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.850> look

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
can't tell the difference from the look

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
can't tell the difference from the look
cause<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.329> not<00:01:48.420> supposed<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> change<00:01:49.140> color

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
cause it's not supposed to change color

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.830 
cause it's not supposed to change color
or<00:01:49.560> texture

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
or texture

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.060 
or texture
only<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> should<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.290> able<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> tell<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
only way you should be able to tell a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.959 
only way you should be able to tell a
difference<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.420> gonna<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.840> colder<00:01:55.969> but

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
difference if it's gonna be colder but

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.510 
difference if it's gonna be colder but
when<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> comes<00:01:57.420> to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.000 

the<00:02:02.520> Nature<00:02:02.910> Made<00:02:03.120> fish<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.290> used<00:02:04.830> to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
the Nature Made fish was that I used to

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.840 
the Nature Made fish was that I used to
take<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:07.260> clearly<00:02:07.590> tell<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.580> has<00:02:08.820> a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
take you can clearly tell that one has a

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.220 
take you can clearly tell that one has a
fog<00:02:09.320> one<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.500> fogged<00:02:10.800> up<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:12.570> potency

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
fog one is fogged up so the potency

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.430 
fog one is fogged up so the potency
isn't<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.310> legitimate<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.840> was<00:02:15.960> thinking

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
isn't as legitimate as I was thinking

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.350 
isn't as legitimate as I was thinking
and/or<00:02:17.010> hoping<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> put<00:02:18.240> this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and/or hoping so I'm going to put this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.620 
and/or hoping so I'm going to put this
back<00:02:18.570> now<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> which<00:02:20.490> one<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.760> these<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:23.630> okay

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
back now and which one of these was okay

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.210 
back now and which one of these was okay
this<00:02:24.750> one's<00:02:24.960> cold<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:25.860> won't<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.190> over

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
this one's cold so this won't be over

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.800 
this one's cold so this won't be over
here<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.840> put<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.380> back<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.430> then

yep well there we go finally pump the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.790 
yep well there we go finally pump the
little<00:03:20.870> bubble<00:03:21.200> in<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:23.810> uh<00:03:23.960> let<00:03:24.530> me<00:03:24.620> see

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
little bubble in it it's uh let me see

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.830 
little bubble in it it's uh let me see
if<00:03:24.860> we<00:03:24.890> could<00:03:25.070> bring<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.490> light<00:03:25.840> looks

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
if we could bring it in the light looks

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.570 
if we could bring it in the light looks
a<00:03:26.960> little<00:03:27.080> frosted<00:03:27.770> on<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.980> inside<00:03:28.340> that's

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
a little frosted on the inside that's

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.330 
a little frosted on the inside that's
why<00:03:28.730> it's<00:03:28.910> not<00:03:29.030> seeping<00:03:29.450> out<00:03:29.540> like<00:03:29.780> that

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
why it's not seeping out like that

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.280 
why it's not seeping out like that
as<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.430> can<00:03:31.580> see<00:03:31.760> there's<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.120> gas<00:03:32.660> right<00:03:33.020> there

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
as you can see there's a gas right there

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.140 
as you can see there's a gas right there
and<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.680> it's<00:03:36.830> not<00:03:36.920> completely<00:03:37.130> frozen<00:03:37.820> I

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
and so it's not completely frozen I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.100 
and so it's not completely frozen I
don't<00:03:38.870> know<00:03:38.960> if<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.140> could<00:03:39.320> see<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:40.660> but<00:03:41.660> you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
don't know if you could see it but you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.170 
don't know if you could see it but you
see<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.410> frost<00:03:42.740> in<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.340> inside<00:03:43.760> that's<00:03:43.970> where

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
see the frost in the inside that's where

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.420 
see the frost in the inside that's where
it<00:03:44.300> was<00:03:44.390> getting<00:03:44.660> its<00:03:44.780> fog<00:03:45.050> from<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.710> little<00:03:46.340> bit

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
it was getting its fog from a little bit

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.460 
it was getting its fog from a little bit
of<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:46.730> came<00:03:46.880> out<00:03:47.150> he<00:03:47.930> probably<00:03:48.140> had<00:03:48.380> about

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
of it came out he probably had about

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.410 
of it came out he probably had about
another<00:03:48.860> week<00:03:49.100> left<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:50.150> survive<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:53.000> exactly

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
another week left to survive not exactly

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.940 
another week left to survive not exactly
sure<00:03:53.720> what<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.170> would<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.320> been<00:03:54.410> doing<00:03:54.740> in<00:03:54.830> my

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
sure what it would have been doing in my

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.120 
sure what it would have been doing in my
body<00:03:55.270> besides<00:03:56.270> not<00:03:56.770> what<00:03:57.770> it<00:03:57.860> was<00:03:57.950> supposed<00:03:58.250> to

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
body besides not what it was supposed to

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.560 
body besides not what it was supposed to
so<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.220> bottom<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.640> guess<00:04:01.850> these<00:04:02.150> are<00:04:02.210> still

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
so the bottom I guess these are still

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.950 
so the bottom I guess these are still
gets<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.050> plan<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.290> using<00:04:03.590> these<00:04:03.890> yeah<00:04:04.810> well<00:04:05.810> as

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.570 
gets I plan on using these yeah well as
far<00:04:06.200> as<00:04:06.380> as<00:04:06.620> far<00:04:06.800> as<00:04:06.950> these<00:04:07.130> go<00:04:07.370> the

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
far as as far as these go the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.100 
far as as far as these go the
nature-made<00:04:07.880> wack<00:04:08.480> fishless

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
nature-made wack fishless

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.550 
nature-made wack fishless
