00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.840
 I 'll make it great today. 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.640
 Although not perfect for the first time, o2 focus was successful 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.640
 Let's shoot beyond that. 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:28.600
 That money was a problem. 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 And yet autofocus is not working perfectly yet. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.620
 Often unstable and firmware 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 Now 20 million now and many more 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 Let's try to sort out the surrounding tools, 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.809
 I think we'll have to do some more verification first. 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.420
 As you can see, 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.430
 Once I'm caught up with the manufacturer of the autocos. 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.800
 If this is the case, it will fail. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.870
 Yet this is now 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.960
 Come now, once the brain is like life in many ways to the modern Now 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.460
 5 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.460
 I need to use a lot of nerve. 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.229
 Fifth Focus is now successful 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:40.600
 The windows but does not fit exactly into focus as you can see 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.600
 The reason is that when the word has now booted think from now on the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.860
 The sound data now looks like it has a value set on it . 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.950
 I think we should try. 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 Now , 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.730
 30 x 30 panels now 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.690
 I had it on the rechargeable battery. 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:06.700
 Next, I'll show you the next one. 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.640
 It will be applied to the funds coming from the lens firmware chuknaeneun 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.150
 What we see now, uh 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:21.160
 This is the bundle lens . I made a sleeve using the data on that tag . 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 Yesterday I finally got a Faro bundle lens 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.560
 U 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 I'm planning to implement it now. 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.390
 The autofocus algorithm itself has three to match this stepper motor. 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.630
 There 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.099
 The AF speed is much faster so I plan to have 1 of these lenses 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.209
 With the data 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:48.800
 To save the auto focus, the image will look 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.800
 I will once again try Botox 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 I'm going to have to do it again. 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.260
 and then 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:26.030
 Well, now multi-focus has been sent. 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.400
 Uh, now the focus is exactly right, but now I have some luxury digital tuning 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.840
 I need it. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.510
 Anyway , 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.510
 I will remind the first successful over
