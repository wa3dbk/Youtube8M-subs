to<00:02:12.660> keep<00:02:12.870> practicing<00:02:13.650> at<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.060> said

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
to keep practicing at it and like I said

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the key is to actually go ahead and add

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.610 
the key is to actually go ahead and add
extra<00:02:17.880> polish<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:19.170> I'm<00:02:19.320> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> actually

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
nails as well just to see how that would

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.070 
nails as well just to see how that would
look<00:02:33.560> larger<00:02:34.580> design<00:02:35.580> plate<00:02:36.180> sounds<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:36.990> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
look larger design plate sounds good to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.530 
look larger design plate sounds good to
try<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.530> as<00:02:37.980> well<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:39.360> you're<00:02:39.480> just

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
try that out as well so you're just

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.449 
try that out as well so you're just
going<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.810> continue<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.230> paint<00:02:40.560> put<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.130> large

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
going to continue to paint put a large

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.520 
going to continue to paint put a large
amount<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.270> that's<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.810> thick<00:02:43.050> polishes

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
amount and that's the thick polishes

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.780 
amount and that's the thick polishes
actually<00:02:43.890> work<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.130> little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.430> better<00:02:44.610> than

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
actually work a little bit better than

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.490 
actually work a little bit better than
the<00:02:44.880> dinner<00:02:45.090> polishes<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.080> due<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the dinner polishes but due to the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.220 
the dinner polishes but due to the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
spring theme Kelsey entering is this one

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.160 
spring theme Kelsey entering is this one
and<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.770> little<00:02:50.340> bit<00:02:50.670> thinner

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
and it is a little bit thinner

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.650 
and it is a little bit thinner
unfortunately<00:02:52.580> but<00:02:53.580> we'll<00:02:54.180> make<00:02:54.300> do<00:02:54.510> with

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
unfortunately but we'll make do with

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.040 
unfortunately but we'll make do with
what<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.870> do<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.320> there<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.310> also<00:02:56.610> specific

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
polishes that you can use as well

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.960 
polishes that you can use as well
sometimes<00:03:04.830> those<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.340> work<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:05.850> bit

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
sometimes those do work a little bit

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.490 
sometimes those do work a little bit
better

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
better

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.850 
better
just<00:03:07.950> going<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.130> go<00:03:08.250> ahead<00:03:08.340> scrape<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.150> off

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.680 

this<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> larger<00:03:14.700> plan<00:03:14.940> somebody's<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
this is a larger plan somebody's the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.260 
this is a larger plan somebody's the
larger<00:03:16.020> side<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.410> Stamper<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.850> stay

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
larger side of the Stamper and stay

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.700 
larger side of the Stamper and stay
healthy

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.980 

and<00:03:22.220> obviously<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.210> continue<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.840> come

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
and obviously you can continue to come

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.120 
and obviously you can continue to come
back<00:03:24.230> over<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.750> said<00:03:29.960> she<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.770> go<00:03:30.890> ahead

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
is the finished product of the Stamper

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.490 
is the finished product of the Stamper
Earl<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.950> was<00:03:46.340> pretty<00:03:47.240> darn<00:03:47.840> hard<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.350> use

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
Earl it was pretty darn hard to use

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.740 
Earl it was pretty darn hard to use
believe<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.890> or<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:49.850> if<00:03:50.270> you're<00:03:50.540> an

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
Stamper honestly I would not recommend

Stamper honestly I would not recommend
the<00:03:55.430> salon<00:03:55.730> is<00:03:55.850> Express<00:03:56.300> or<00:03:56.600> any<00:03:57.230> Stamper<00:03:57.680> if

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the salon is Express or any Stamper if

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.060 
the salon is Express or any Stamper if
you<00:03:58.580> are<00:03:58.850> new<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.150> stamping<00:03:59.750> in<00:03:59.900> general<00:04:00.320> it's

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
you are new to stamping in general it's

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.440 
you are new to stamping in general it's
going<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.370> take<00:04:01.520> some<00:04:01.550> time<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.090> actually<00:04:02.180> do

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
going to take some time to actually do

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.690 
going to take some time to actually do
it<00:04:02.480> my<00:04:03.080> recommendation<00:04:03.380> would<00:04:03.800> be<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.160> void

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
it my recommendation would be a void

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.200 
it my recommendation would be a void
thin<00:04:05.240> polishes<00:04:06.520> anything<00:04:07.520> that's<00:04:07.730> too<00:04:07.940> thin

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
thin polishes anything that's too thin

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.090 
thin polishes anything that's too thin
won't<00:04:08.840> actually<00:04:09.110> work<00:04:09.470> very<00:04:09.740> well<00:04:09.800> in<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
won't actually work very well in the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.910 
won't actually work very well in the
stampers<00:04:10.490> as<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.730> can<00:04:10.880> see<00:04:11.150> some<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:12.230> these

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
stampers as you can see some of these

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.430 
stampers as you can see some of these
stamps<00:04:13.400> came<00:04:13.640> out<00:04:13.820> very<00:04:14.240> funky<00:04:14.780> because<00:04:15.290> of

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
stamps came out very funky because of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.150 
stamps came out very funky because of
the<00:04:15.530> way<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.340> actual<00:04:17.020> Stamper<00:04:18.020> tends<00:04:18.890> to

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
the way that the actual Stamper tends to

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.790 
the way that the actual Stamper tends to
be<00:04:19.310> with<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.640> thin<00:04:19.850> polishes<00:04:20.530> other<00:04:21.530> than

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
be with the thin polishes other than

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.100 
be with the thin polishes other than
that<00:04:21.860> it's<00:04:22.520> pretty<00:04:22.670> easy<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.360> use<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.990> just

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
that it's pretty easy to use it just

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.690 
that it's pretty easy to use it just
takes<00:04:24.380> some<00:04:24.530> time<00:04:24.770> because<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.280> do<00:04:25.430> have<00:04:25.460> to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
takes some time because you do have to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.550 
takes some time because you do have to
let<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.940> polish<00:04:26.360> dry<00:04:28.240> but<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.110> very

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
let the polish dry but it is a very

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.100 
let the polish dry but it is a very
decent<00:04:31.100> Stamper<00:04:31.790> for<00:04:32.120> ten<00:04:32.360> dollars<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:32.990> all

the<00:04:33.260> items<00:04:33.560> that<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.770> get<00:04:33.950> because<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.250> do

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
the items that you get because you do

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.540 
the items that you get because you do

get five plate to eat the Stamper holder
the<00:04:37.550> Stamper<00:04:38.030> itself<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:40.100> it's<00:04:40.400> not<00:04:40.610> bad<00:04:41.080> but

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
the Stamper itself so it's not bad but

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
with a little thicker base like china

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.760 
with a little thicker base like china
