00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
obviously damaged in some way it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
obviously damaged in some way it
probably<00:00:28.349> needs<00:00:28.619> work<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> guitar

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
probably needs work but if a guitar

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
probably needs work but if a guitar
looks<00:00:30.150> pretty<00:00:30.510> good<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> pretty<00:00:31.199> solid<00:00:31.740> there

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
looks pretty good and pretty solid there

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.069 
looks pretty good and pretty solid there
are<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> few<00:00:32.340> simple<00:00:32.489> ways<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.120> tell<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.899> if

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
are a few simple ways you can tell so if

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.150 
are a few simple ways you can tell so if
you're<00:00:34.200> playing<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> guitar<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you're playing the guitar and the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.709 
you're playing the guitar and the
strings<00:00:35.430> are<00:00:35.550> constantly<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> tune

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
strings are constantly going out of tune

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.090 
strings are constantly going out of tune
and<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.110> cannot<00:00:37.410> keep<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> thing<00:00:37.980> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and you just cannot keep the thing in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.040 
and you just cannot keep the thing in
tune<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.730> probably<00:00:39.180> needs<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.600> looked<00:00:39.899> at

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
tune it probably needs to be looked at

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
tune it probably needs to be looked at
another<00:00:40.739> way<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.489> able<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> tell<00:00:41.969> if<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
another way to be able to tell if a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
another way to be able to tell if a
guitar<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> very<00:00:42.750> sound<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> solid<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
guitar is very sound and solid is you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130 
guitar is very sound and solid is you
can<00:00:44.430> pick<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> actually<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.750> down

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
can pick it up and actually look down

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.160 
can pick it up and actually look down
the<00:00:46.739> neck<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> guitar<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:49.050> also

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the neck of the guitar and you can also

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
the neck of the guitar and you can also
turn<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> sideways<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.059> what

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
turn it sideways and look and see what

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
turn it sideways and look and see what
the<00:00:51.750> neck<00:00:51.989> looks<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> neck<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the neck looks like and if the neck is

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
the neck looks like and if the neck is
warped<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.270> way<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.960> bent<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.500> bowed

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
warped in some way if it's bent or bowed

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
warped in some way if it's bent or bowed
that<00:00:56.640> could<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> reasons<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that could be one of the reasons that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.360 
that could be one of the reasons that
the<00:00:58.079> strings<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.920> tune<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the strings are going at it tune and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.889 
the strings are going at it tune and
that's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> pretty<00:00:59.760> easy<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> tell<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.750> can

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's a pretty easy way to tell you can

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's a pretty easy way to tell you can
do<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.320> by<00:01:01.410> doing<00:01:01.710> things<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
do that just by doing things like this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
do that just by doing things like this
by<00:01:02.609> looking<00:01:02.969> sideways<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.750> neck<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
by looking sideways at the neck and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.850 
by looking sideways at the neck and
seeing<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.920> looks<00:01:05.129> even<00:01:05.519> looking<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
seeing if it looks even looking down the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.859 
seeing if it looks even looking down the
neck<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.580> seeing<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> strings<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
neck like that seeing if the strings and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
neck like that seeing if the strings and
everything<00:01:10.200> look<00:01:10.380> even<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
everything look even and if you have a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
everything look even and if you have a
level<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> ruler<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.860> eye<00:01:13.890> isn't<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
level or a ruler if your eye isn't that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.969 
level or a ruler if your eye isn't that
great<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:16.080> check<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> level

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
great you can just check it with a level

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
great you can just check it with a level
or<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> ruler<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.750> way

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
or a ruler so that's one way

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
or a ruler so that's one way
now<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> guitar<00:01:20.280> has<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
now if the guitar has some kind of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600 
now if the guitar has some kind of
electronic<00:01:21.900> component<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> tuner

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
electronic component to it like a tuner

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
electronic component to it like a tuner
or<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.470> pickup<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.680> something<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
or a pickup or something like that and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.850 
or a pickup or something like that and
you're<00:01:27.360> plugging<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.380> can't<00:01:28.619> seem<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you're plugging it in you can't seem to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
you're plugging it in you can't seem to
get<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> tuner<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> pickup<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> work<00:01:30.329> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
get the tuner or the pickup to work it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.740 
get the tuner or the pickup to work it
may<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.100> broken<00:01:32.460> electronic<00:01:33.270> part<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.630> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
may be a broken electronic part but it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
may be a broken electronic part but it
also<00:01:33.900> could<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.350> need<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> battery<00:01:34.950> that's
