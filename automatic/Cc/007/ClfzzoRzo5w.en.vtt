00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.990 
system down you have to take your stylus
out<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.920> things<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.610> they

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
out and things like that they just they

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
out and things like that they just they
don't<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.720> guess<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> culpability<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
don't want I guess the culpability of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.420 
don't want I guess the culpability of
maybe<00:01:41.070> losing<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> most<00:01:43.860> part<00:01:44.130> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
maybe losing it so for the most part I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789 
maybe losing it so for the most part I
stripped<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> down<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.259> talked<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.710> guy

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
stripped it down and I talked to the guy

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
stripped it down and I talked to the guy
I'm<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.880> nothing<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.360> can

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I'm like is there really nothing you can

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.090 
I'm like is there really nothing you can
do<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.350> me<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.040> up

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
do is there a way for me to back it up

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850 
do is there a way for me to back it up
to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> SD<00:01:50.700> card<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> way<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.560> save

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to the SD card is there a way I can save

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
to the SD card is there a way I can save
my<00:01:52.890> streetpass<00:01:53.490> features<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.600> puzzle

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
my streetpass features like my puzzle

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
my streetpass features like my puzzle
pieces<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.560> things<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.890> he<00:01:56.250> said

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
pieces and things like that he said

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
pieces and things like that he said
sometimes<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.869> delete<00:01:58.110> them

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
sometimes we don't have to delete them

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.950 
sometimes we don't have to delete them
but<00:01:59.130> he<00:01:59.219> said<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.700> cases<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.149> data<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
but he said in some cases that data is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.749 
but he said in some cases that data is
deleted<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.740> there's<00:02:02.219> no<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
deleted and there's no way for them to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.999 
deleted and there's no way for them to
back<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> got<00:02:04.500> off<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> phone<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
back it up so when I got off the phone I

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.039 
back it up so when I got off the phone I
really<00:02:05.159> started<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
really started to think about it and I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.570 
really started to think about it and I
really<00:02:07.560> wanted<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> save<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.399> information

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
really wanted to save that information

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
really wanted to save that information
now<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.599> thing<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:09.929> said<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> could

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
now the one thing he said that I could

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.670 
now the one thing he said that I could
do<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.770> back<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.310> was<00:02:12.180> migrated<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.110> my

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
do to back it up was migrated all my

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.940 
do to back it up was migrated all my
information<00:02:14.129> over<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.670> another<00:02:14.879> 3ds<00:02:15.359> system

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
information over to another 3ds system

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.440 
information over to another 3ds system
which<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.310> first<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.969> seemed<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.329> little

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
which at first I seemed a little

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.390 
which at first I seemed a little
outraged<00:02:18.840> about<00:02:19.079> because<00:02:19.560> buying<00:02:20.129> another

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
outraged about because buying another

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.289 
outraged about because buying another
system<00:02:20.819> really<00:02:21.480> wasn't<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.049> solution<00:02:22.590> for<00:02:22.769> me<00:02:22.950> I

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
system really wasn't a solution for me I

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.059 
system really wasn't a solution for me I
didn't<00:02:24.299> want<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.659> go<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.989> route<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.469> like<00:02:25.890> my

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
didn't want to go that route I like my

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
didn't want to go that route I like my
Luigi<00:02:26.430> skin<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.450> everything<00:02:27.750> about<00:02:27.989> my

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
Luigi skin I like everything about my

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.890 
Luigi skin I like everything about my
system<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.829> wanted<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.219> to<00:02:29.340> work<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.900> at

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
system I just wanted it to work but at

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.069 
system I just wanted it to work but at
the<00:02:31.019> end<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.379> day<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:32.000> realized<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.239> my

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
the end of the day I realized that my

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.690 
the end of the day I realized that my
dad<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.980> important<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.400> me<00:02:35.549> which

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
dad I was really important to me which

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.429 
dad I was really important to me which
is<00:02:35.730> kind<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.090> strange<00:02:36.209> because<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.109> wouldn't

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
is kind of strange because you wouldn't

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.190 
is kind of strange because you wouldn't
really<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.650> about<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.129> too<00:02:38.459> much<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:39.200> try

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
really think about that too much I try

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.509 
really think about that too much I try
not<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.680> too<00:02:40.739> wrapped<00:02:41.040> up<00:02:41.219> in<00:02:41.340> online

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
not to get too wrapped up in online

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.860 
not to get too wrapped up in online
content<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.329> just<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.659> with<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
content was just like with the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.949 
content was just like with the
PlayStation<00:02:43.409> 3<00:02:43.680> when<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.250> broke<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.689> I

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
PlayStation 3 when it broke I just I

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.599 
PlayStation 3 when it broke I just I
really<00:02:46.409> didn't<00:02:46.739> want<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.950> deal<00:02:47.099> with<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:47.579> I

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
really didn't want to deal with it but I

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.129 
really didn't want to deal with it but I
had<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.060> much<00:02:48.120> wrapped<00:02:48.419> up<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.750> into

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
had so much wrapped up to into

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.080 
had so much wrapped up to into
playstation<00:02:49.650> network<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:50.250> i<00:02:50.489> felt<00:02:50.819> like<00:02:50.879> it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
playstation network that i felt like it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.990 
playstation network that i felt like it
would<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.269> been<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.419> waste<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.609> went

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
would have been a waste not to so I went

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.199 
would have been a waste not to so I went
out<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.959> got<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.260> new<00:02:55.500> 3ds<00:02:55.919> and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.819> decided

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
out and I got a new 3ds and I decided

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.539 
out and I got a new 3ds and I decided
what<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.659> heck<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.379> I'm<00:02:58.829> gonna<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.219> new<00:02:59.400> one

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
what the heck if I'm gonna get a new one

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.119 
what the heck if I'm gonna get a new one
I'll<00:02:59.790> go<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.209> new<00:03:00.419> color<00:03:00.689> and<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.859> actually

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.819 
I'll go with a new color and I actually
picked<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.819> pink<00:03:03.000> one<00:03:03.180> which<00:03:03.719> is<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.109> now

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
I was able to transfer everything to it

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.699 
I was able to transfer everything to it
appropriately<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.719> has<00:03:09.750> my<00:03:10.139> ambassador
