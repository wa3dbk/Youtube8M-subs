hello this is going to be a review of my
mosey<00:00:02.820> diamond<00:00:03.449> puzzle<00:00:03.810> now<00:00:04.529> mosey<00:00:05.160> is<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
mosey diamond puzzle now mosey is the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.570 
mosey diamond puzzle now mosey is the
company<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.089> makes<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.750> puzzle<00:00:07.400> I'm<00:00:08.400> not

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
company that makes this puzzle I'm not

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.490 
company that makes this puzzle I'm not
really<00:00:08.670> sure<00:00:08.790> what<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.599> puzzle<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.019> called<00:00:10.320> I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
really sure what this puzzle is called I

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.669 
really sure what this puzzle is called I
think<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:10.800> something<00:00:10.950> like<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.990> diamond<00:00:12.990> door

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
think it's something like a diamond door

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.279 
think it's something like a diamond door
tetchy<00:00:14.330> tetrahedron<00:00:15.330> or<00:00:15.630> something<00:00:16.170> like

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
tetchy tetrahedron or something like

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189 
tetchy tetrahedron or something like
that<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> don't<00:00:16.560> know<00:00:16.850> but<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:19.050> is

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
that I don't know but what I do know is

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.349 
that I don't know but what I do know is
that<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.470> puzzle<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.800> pretty<00:00:19.980> cool

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
that this puzzle is pretty cool

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
that this puzzle is pretty cool
basically<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.350> skewed<00:00:22.859> mod

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
basically what this is is a skewed mod

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.420 
basically what this is is a skewed mod
and<00:00:23.570> I'll<00:00:24.570> show<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.869> how<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> ski<00:00:25.380> mod<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and I'll show you how to ski mod this is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.040 
and I'll show you how to ski mod this is
the<00:00:26.519> center<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.570> either<00:00:27.689> move<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the center and you can either move it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.600 
the center and you can either move it
like<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.730> like<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:32.550> like

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
like this like this like that or like

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.799 
like this like this like that or like
that<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.100> those<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.850> four<00:00:36.149> accesses

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that so it has those like four accesses

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.380 
that so it has those like four accesses
of<00:00:36.960> rotations<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.850> that's<00:00:38.850> basically<00:00:39.090> what

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
of rotations and that's basically what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
of rotations and that's basically what
makes<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> ask<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.950> bit

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
makes it ask you now it's a little bit

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.200 
makes it ask you now it's a little bit
easier<00:00:41.520> than<00:00:43.129> like<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> skew<00:00:44.520> Balta<00:00:44.820> MIT<00:00:44.969> like

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
easier than like a skew Balta MIT like

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.790 
easier than like a skew Balta MIT like
it<00:00:45.360> does<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> whole<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.590> where<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
it does have the whole thing where you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.139 
it does have the whole thing where you
have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> orient<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.520> center's<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> right

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
have to orient the center's the right

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
have to orient the center's the right
way<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.989> nearly<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.350> difficult<00:00:49.500> as

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
way but it's not nearly as difficult as

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.590 
way but it's not nearly as difficult as
the<00:00:49.980> skee<00:00:50.219> ball<00:00:50.399> team<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the skee ball team it is so it's a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
the skee ball team it is so it's a
little<00:00:51.750> bit<00:00:51.870> harder<00:00:52.320> than<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.590> cube<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.010> some

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
little bit harder than this cube in some

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.639 
little bit harder than this cube in some
areas<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.030> easier<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.050> other<00:00:55.230> areas

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
areas a little bit easier in other areas

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.350 
areas a little bit easier in other areas
because<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> fact<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> corners

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
because of the fact that the corners

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
because of the fact that the corners
which<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.260> Center<00:00:58.649> triangles

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
which are these little Center triangles

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.420 
which are these little Center triangles
just<00:00:59.780> only<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.199> color<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
just only have one color so it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
just only have one color so it's
impossible<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.830> unoriented<00:01:04.830> they're<00:01:05.610> always

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
impossible to unoriented they're always

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
impossible to unoriented they're always
oriented<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.720> makes<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.260> bit

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
oriented so that makes it a little bit

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
oriented so that makes it a little bit
easier<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.460> you're<00:01:08.580> solving<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
easier so when you're solving for the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
easier so when you're solving for the
corners<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:11.790> never<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> worry<00:01:12.479> about

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
corners you never have to worry about

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
corners you never have to worry about
orienting<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.280> only<00:01:14.549> pieces<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
orienting them you the only pieces you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
orienting them you the only pieces you
have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> worry<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.420> orienting<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
have to worry about orienting are in

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
have to worry about orienting are in
these<00:01:16.710> centerpieces<00:01:17.360> another<00:01:18.360> thing<00:01:18.659> that's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
these centerpieces another thing that's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.270 
these centerpieces another thing that's
really<00:01:19.020> cool<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.650> puzzle<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
really cool about this puzzle is that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
really cool about this puzzle is that
first<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.240> easy<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> take<00:01:21.720> apart<00:01:21.840> all

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
first of all it's easy to take apart all

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
first of all it's easy to take apart all
you<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> apart<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you have to do to take it apart this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
you have to do to take it apart this
move<00:01:23.850> two<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.420> little<00:01:24.840> bigger<00:01:25.259> pieces

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
move two of these little bigger pieces

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
move two of these little bigger pieces
next<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.040> each<00:01:26.130> other<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.520> pull<00:01:26.759> apart<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
next to each other and pull apart on

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
next to each other and pull apart on
them<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.049> will<00:01:28.229> pop<00:01:28.409> out<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.950> easily

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
them and one will pop out really easily

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.450 
them and one will pop out really easily
and<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.439> can<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.680> apart<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.220> now

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and you can take it apart from there now

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
and you can take it apart from there now
that's<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> inside<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.630> has<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.110> um<00:01:34.670> little

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's the inside it has that um little

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.260 
that's the inside it has that um little
spider<00:01:36.060> core<00:01:36.570> looking<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.240> one<00:01:39.240> thing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
spider core looking thing and one thing

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
spider core looking thing and one thing
that's<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.750> cool<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.920> locking

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that's really cool is the locking

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's really cool is the locking
mechanism<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> puzzle<00:01:42.299> these<00:01:43.079> little

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
mechanism of this puzzle these little

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
mechanism of this puzzle these little
pieces<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.310> Hollow<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> these

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
pieces right here are Hollow and these

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
pieces right here are Hollow and these
little<00:01:45.750> bumps<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.560> edges<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.490> clicks

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
little bumps on the edges is what clicks

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.649 
little bumps on the edges is what clicks
it<00:01:47.939> into<00:01:48.180> place<00:01:49.490> now<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.579> works<00:01:51.180> very<00:01:51.509> very

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it into place now that works very very

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.840 
it into place now that works very very
well<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> locking<00:01:52.770> mechanism<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.670> one

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
well for the locking mechanism it's one

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
well for the locking mechanism it's one
of<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> better<00:01:54.180> locking<00:01:54.810> mechanisms<00:01:55.320> I've

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of the better locking mechanisms I've

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.370 
of the better locking mechanisms I've
seen<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.549> works<00:01:56.759> very<00:01:56.939> well<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.990> only<00:01:58.200> bad

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
seen and it works very well the only bad

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
seen and it works very well the only bad
thing<00:01:58.649> about<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.979> puzzle<00:01:59.340> I'd<00:01:59.460> say<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
thing about this puzzle I'd say is the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
thing about this puzzle I'd say is the
quality<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> core<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.200> quality<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
quality of the core the quality of the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.399 
quality of the core the quality of the
pieces<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.159> relatively<00:02:02.640> good<00:02:03.380> they're<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
pieces is relatively good they're a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.020 
pieces is relatively good they're a
little<00:02:04.770> bit<00:02:04.950> cheap<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.549> haven't<00:02:05.729> broke

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
little bit cheap but they haven't broke

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
little bit cheap but they haven't broke
or<00:02:06.210> anything<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> core<00:02:06.990> has<00:02:07.170> broke<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.680> me

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
or anything but the core has broke on me

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.499 
or anything but the core has broke on me
and<00:02:08.160> you'll<00:02:08.190> see<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.910> some<00:02:09.300> black

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and you'll see I have some black

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.420 
and you'll see I have some black
electrical<00:02:09.539> tape<00:02:10.080> around<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.280> even

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
electrical tape around it you can even

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.339 
electrical tape around it you can even
see<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.849> crack<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.840> see<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> crack

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
see the crack you can see the crack

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.260 
see the crack you can see the crack
where<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
where the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.980 
where the
puzzle<00:02:15.270> was<00:02:15.650> broken<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> core<00:02:17.190> now

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
puzzle was broken on the core now

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.360 
puzzle was broken on the core now
fortunately<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:19.260> able<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.620> fix<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:20.160> if

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
fortunately I was able to fix it but if

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.070 
fortunately I was able to fix it but if
I<00:02:20.520> hadn't<00:02:20.820> been<00:02:20.940> able<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.240> fix<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
I hadn't been able to fix it then I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.360 
I hadn't been able to fix it then I
would<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.590> throw<00:02:22.860> away<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> entire

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
would have to throw away the entire

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
would have to throw away the entire
puzzle<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.880> because<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> core<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.660> really

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
puzzle just because the core was really

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.100 
puzzle just because the core was really
crappy<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> little<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.270> cautious<00:02:27.690> when

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
crappy so be a little bit cautious when

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
lubricate the puzzle like this don't do

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.690 
lubricate the puzzle like this don't do
this<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.290> will<00:02:40.410> ruin<00:02:40.650> your<00:02:40.950> cube<00:02:41.280> don't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
this or it will ruin your cube don't

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.820 
this or it will ruin your cube don't
take<00:02:41.910> one<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.270> spray<00:02:43.050> lubricant<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.770> then

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
take one out spray lubricant and then

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.340 
take one out spray lubricant and then
pop<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.550> back<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.360> will<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:46.110> work<00:02:46.140> that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
pop this back in it will not work that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.310 
pop this back in it will not work that
way<00:02:46.740> I've<00:02:47.190> done<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.630> cube<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
way I've done it on this cube and it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080 
way I've done it on this cube and it
ended<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:50.070> ruining<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:50.940> piece

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
ended up like ruining that little piece

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.729 
ended up like ruining that little piece
right<00:02:51.209> there<00:02:51.330> luckily<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.930> was<00:02:52.110> able<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.350> fix<00:02:52.530> it

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
right there luckily I was able to fix it

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.440 
right there luckily I was able to fix it
but<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.550> almost<00:02:53.700> guarantee<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.390> will

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
but I can almost guarantee that you will

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.940 
but I can almost guarantee that you will
break<00:02:54.690> your<00:02:54.810> puzzle<00:02:55.110> if<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> do<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.709> that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
break your puzzle if you do it like that

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.580 
break your puzzle if you do it like that
it's<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:57.000> too<00:02:57.360> dangerous<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.020> it's<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it's a little too dangerous and it's a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.470 
it's a little too dangerous and it's a
lot<00:02:58.739> easier<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.400> take<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.640> apart<00:02:59.910> lay<00:03:00.330> out

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
lot easier to just take it apart lay out

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
lot easier to just take it apart lay out
all<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.720> pieces<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.200> spray<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.860> leave

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
all the pieces and spray it and leave

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.210 
all the pieces and spray it and leave
the<00:03:02.580> core<00:03:03.080> without<00:03:04.080> spraying<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.980> spray

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the core without spraying if you spray

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.670 
the core without spraying if you spray
the<00:03:05.370> court<00:03:05.610> you'll<00:03:05.820> probably<00:03:06.590> ruin<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the court you'll probably ruin the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.510 
the court you'll probably ruin the
puzzle<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.340> again<00:03:08.610> don't<00:03:08.850> spray<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> court

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
puzzle so again don't spray the court

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.860 
puzzle so again don't spray the court
other<00:03:11.520> than<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.630> hear<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
other than that you can you can hear the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.060 
other than that you can you can hear the
lock<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.110> make<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.350> mechanism<00:03:13.860> here<00:03:13.950> and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
lock and make it mechanism here and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.210 
lock and make it mechanism here and
check<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.310> out<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:19.709> works<00:03:19.890> really<00:03:20.100> really

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
check that out it works really really

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.570 
check that out it works really really
well<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:21.570> locking<00:03:21.900> mechanism<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.620> very

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
well the locking mechanism is very

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.850 
well the locking mechanism is very
stable<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> better<00:03:25.440> ones<00:03:25.530> I've

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
stable it's one of the better ones I've

than<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.459> Scoob<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.209> some<00:03:36.510> ways<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> little<00:03:37.080> bit

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
than the Scoob in some ways a little bit

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.690 
than the Scoob in some ways a little bit
easier<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.590> other<00:03:37.739> ways<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.370> nearly<00:03:38.580> as

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
easier in other ways it's not nearly as

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.699 
easier in other ways it's not nearly as
