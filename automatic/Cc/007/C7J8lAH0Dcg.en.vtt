00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.290
 another exercise of leaving the attack line 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.769
 note overlay attackers 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.279
 partner's hands you must hold not 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.279
 brush your forearm with your hands 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.120
 first work slowly 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.120
 gradually accelerating the pace 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:09.210
 one of the options after the counterattack 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 from the opponent 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.140
 I repeat every step is one hit 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.140
 by hand 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.590
 also work off the attack line and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.039
 counterattack 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.439
 can be relatively white lines on the floor 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.130
 can draw it with chalk or put 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.130
 white belt
