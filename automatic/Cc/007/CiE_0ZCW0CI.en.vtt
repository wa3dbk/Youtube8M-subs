00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:13.889
 shorter roads you asked for 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.840
 design review what can I say 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.670
 from improvised material collected here 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:28.949
 such a thing the engine sawed head 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.900
 3432 light bronze valves direct 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.500
 camshaft niva light flywheel 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.989
 chain tensioner 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.890
 like the engine more bottom did not touch 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 non-standard so its from capital for 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:54.750
 simple and all 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:58.600
 turbine tkr 651 is placed on the bulls 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.860
 with might and main such a technique is unwound 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.259
 somewhere in 3000 goes on a boost gate 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.389
 put pressure 0 5 bye for now 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.609
 try we do not know yet what kind of mixture 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:13.920
 what then sensors and gt mix quality 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:21.119
 let us put will try to blow more 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:24.539
 intercooler here is chinese 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.130
 also what are the three tubes of the saucepan 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.069
 pots too quickly made 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.049
 to go clean 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:41.529
 power economizer drive 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:46.270
 of the modes from here and see there 

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:48.399
 where's the finger here is this economizer 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.619
 power modes with a spring 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.329
 pulled out itching from the choke 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:02:00.299
 ream direktor and when it goes 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:03.270
 inflated already 0102 there valve is pressed and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.890
 fuel is enriched 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.479
 yes by ignition by ignition ignition 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.230
 dual circuit electronic system 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.360
 Ignition done by travnikov that is 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.860
 two hall sensors two switches two 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:25.530
 coil loan up to 406 somewhere about 20 years 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.890
 there fucking can be seen that even a benz 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.680
 gasoline supply 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 Volga remote fuel pump stood here 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.209
 China fuel pressure regulator 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 accordingly, return flow 2 return flows were not 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:54.540
 pulled with a standard tube gin 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:57.840
 will open the lubrication of the turbine the lubrication of the turbine he 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.010
 sensor visible sensor tee grease 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.489
 times and the US turbine we blow and without 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.019
 water cooling usual after words in 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:14.190
 the trunk in the gas tank just hit another 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.889
 one scooter to plum because this feed 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.019
 from here pulls there through the pump on 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:25.040
 the regulator on the horror controller interrupts 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.040
 back here go show regulators 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.470
 the regulator clocked more gasoline 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.590
 here bye 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.390
 in short it turns out the feed comes from 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:50.220
 pump to the regulator in the regulator tube 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.120
 feed cut costs a tee from this 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.480
 tee that is here it is filing in 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.769
 the regulator went and this one here is the hose 3 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.000
 already in the carburetor on the carburetor 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:09.900
 in the best return the best return well and 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.900
 drain from the regulator so he plum went to drain 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:21.139
 back it turns out here we connect 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:23.400
 the regulator itself was connected to a small one 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.460
 crankcase ventilation on 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.550
 carburetor so he was addicted to 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.390
 boost pressure i.e. if you 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.270
 put in one position this is 05 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.280
 for example to push it is 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.150
 maximum performance regular 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.390
 gasoline pump 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.490
 then at idle it will overflow as well 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:49.310
 obtained at atmospheric pressure 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:53.870
 exposes that 05 connect to vacuum 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.400
 start the car there is a springy delays 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.440
 pressure that becomes the pressure gauge 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.830
 at all we do not show pressure there 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:07.520
 about the unit that something that is on 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:11.539
 idle ok everything turns out 0 0 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.820
 5005 inflatable respectively 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:18.330
 pressurized increases and fuel pressure 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.979
 on the carburetor so that on the other I do not give out 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:26.729
 did not squeeze the fuel from the float 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.720
 the camera was still a very important thing not in 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.830
 plan to 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.300
 but in terms of what when 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.979
 let off the gas 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:41.099
 the flap closes the turbine is spinning 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.409
 pressure still goes to salt xe2 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.250
 drainage holes right here from the top 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:49.680
 parts go to the float chamber I mean 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.729
 jet nozzle squeezes out 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.159
 petrol well pours it shorter when 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.720
 gas released overflow went from behind this 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:01.590
 we have the previous video and with the pipe graduated 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.849
 when gas is released 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.819
 that is, you put it off the air 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:14.009
 everything is normal normal transmission 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:15.379
 switched again gazku gave went there what 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.539
 did there a power economizer 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:23.039
 Modes once drilled jet so 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:27.240
 normal and ekonostat drilled 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:30.599
 there are two times some results that he 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.250
 it turns out without airflow was atmospheric 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.800
 pressure to the sea she decided not to 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.169
 rises in a mine one he works 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.099
 like a normal carburetor that is to say consumption 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:43.139
 there how many 10 meters 80 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:47.219
 my already sneaker clicked there already flowed 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:51.169
 all as ours now shorter tidy up 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:56.190
 Troch we ride picked up the speedometer 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:59.190
 tachometer on tachometer on dual circuit 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.409
 ignition systems knowledgeable people said 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.919
 what to do through two diodes 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:08.279
 when 213 states and they were hooked up 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.139
 The tachometer then works and the machine starts 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.669
 kink 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:13.560
 But it will understand that the resistor 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:18.539
 it will be clear that not some 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:21.050
 trifle but basically everything is looking 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.050
 a continuation
