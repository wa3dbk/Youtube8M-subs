 part of his wife iris west his first 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.000
 appearance was in the flash n-110 1959 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.160
 When he was about 10 years old he went to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 visit your uncle to work however 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 the accident that he gave to barreal in his 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 powers was repeated in why and spilling 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.039
 chemicals on him and giving him the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 same powers west made a copy of the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.689
 his uncle's suit and he started fighting the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.820
 crime under the name of kid flash more 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 He later changed his outfit to a red one with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 yellow which left his hair 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 exposed was one of the founders of 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 the young titans next to the first 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.000
 robin and grayson what to wonder girl 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.579
 Dona Troy and Royal Speedy but as they grow 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.320
 west he realized that his powers were 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 weakened and that his body suffered 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.219
 severe damage so it was removed from the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.500
 fight crime until you can 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 find a cure participated in the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.359
 crisis in the infinite lands where your 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.699
 Uncle died after the energy to which 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.500
 was exposed in this event part of their 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.900
 powers were recovered though 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 I needed to eat in large quantities 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.460
 to maintain your metabolism despite 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.530
 that impediment then returned to the fight 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 against crime by adopting the suit and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.960
 his uncle's identity as flash plus he 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 joined the league of justice later 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 west learned that his powers well 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 like those of other super characters 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 fast come from the strength of the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.010
 speed and when faced with xavi tar the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.900
 priest bar student of the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.480
 speed learned to control it 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.730
 acquiring new powers as well as 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.130
 the previous flash ones because it has a great 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.530
 friendship with green lantern killer rainer 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.050
 he is also friends with night with dick 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 grayson the first cool robin and he dies in 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.070
 infinite crisis when entering the force 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 of speed before they achieve that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.869
 Between super boy prime along with burt 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.060
 allen shows igrexa in final crisis the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.979
 revenge of the villains after the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.380
 dying control of the force species 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.930
 bar talent this did a reverse effect 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.510
 making return to max mercury to home and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.400
 kick to neighborhood in hawaii and then 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.650
 find out the death of burt white 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.540
 directs to take down the villains and this 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.120
 time with the ability to control it 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.620
 spector be your taste cool and technically 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.230
 he did not die or was left behind 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.090
 on the spectrum as it was believed but that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 he managed to avoid getting it though 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.799
 cost of becoming a force of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.629
 light that traveled at a speed 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.670
 incalculable equal and no longer depends on the 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.799
 space forced but he has known how 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.260
 support your powers in time as 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.720
 zoom walt and leave the temporary current 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.180
 in an internal struggle and this is absorbed 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.620
 for the space for the walt and is known 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.569
 also for abusing humor in 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
 dangerous occasions so to the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.200
 start of his career as flash the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.390
 other superheroes took it as a 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.459
 silly but after the crisis 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.410
 final while it becomes much more serious 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.209
 with the return of barrel 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.280
 walt and remains in secondary role in the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.170
 story of the flash while allen 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.079
 and garrick take up the role of flash 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.569
 all flash officers have certain 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.599
 common skills like moving think 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.980
 and react at superhuman speeds 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.500
 besides they all have the ability 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 to vibrate so quickly that they can 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.549
 traverse solid matter 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.040
 for example, neighborhood walls in 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.409
 absolute control over their molecules at 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.660
 to be transformed once allen mirror 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.220
 was able to melt and reconstitute 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.470
 in his human form 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.330
 all flash receive their powers of 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.370
 the strength of the wow speed this 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.710
 has a direct connection to it and through 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.290
 this can not be restricted to your use of 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.300
 the same quest is able to use the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.430
 force of speed to create a 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.740
 suit and even bestow or remove 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.690
 speed to other people or objects in 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.580
 movement - there is garrick has shown 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.980
 have some degree of management of this 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.750
 ability also caused those 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.790
 objects through which vibrated 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.890
 will explode although recently 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.650
 could avoid this side effect 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.209
 It can also, although not with the same 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.700
 precision that neighborhood in when 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.230
 he used his cosmic treadmill to travel to 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.720
 through time and dimensions 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.950
 by means of its own power of form 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.830
 similar to alen in his case number 4 1956 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.630
 however it costs currently accelerates 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.700
 to the point of skirting the dimension of 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.200
 force of speed and can also 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.360
 travel through time to points 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.790
 specific when they become visible 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.010
 although you need to identify the vibration 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.230
 characteristic of some sprinter in that 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.660
 period or be familiar with the 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.670
 vibration of it is otherwise the 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.470
 only sprinter capable of over 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.600
 after running at the speed of the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.430
 light all the others have died or have 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.980
 been absorbed by the force of the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.220
 speed after the death of west and 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.970
 the return of bat the latter absorbs 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.160
 involuntarily the space force 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050
 being able to go at speeds higher than 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.360
 that of other sprinters and even 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.640
 manage strength by bringing it back 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.770
 those trapped in the space force but 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.930
 Bhar was killed by the villains and 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.600
 then his power is possibly in 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.430
 willy's hands who came back to life 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.620
 the only one aware that bartz had 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.540
 this skill was already and garrick but not 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.850
 he wanted to say nothing since traveling to 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.890
 high speeds could complicate the 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.140
 existence of the other trapped 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.270
 skill that flash have in common 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.070
 is to read at super speed and 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.650
 this way process huge amounts 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.630
 of information however the 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.850
 knowledge acquired in this way 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.470
 It is usually temporary except for bar 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.480
 talent who seems to acquire it 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.940
 permanently although initially 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.130
 Max Mercury did not think that was going to 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.470
 last the flash plus other 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.080
 sprinters are able to speak to a 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.610
 incredible speed this is used 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.689
 mainly to sustain 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.549
 conversations 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.259
 in front of people other than what 

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:39.569
 fast enough to 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.849
 understand although it is also used with 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.529
 comic effect making flash speak 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.259
 so fast that his words are 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.329
 unintelligible a feature of the 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.369
 flashes your sense of humor the most 

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:52.319
 known for this is west valley that 

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:53.849
 he had so much humor against the villains 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.249
 that always the other superheroes 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.959
 they ended up reproaching him for an effect 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.969
 secondary of super powers 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:01.829
 speed is your accelerated metabolism 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.839
 so they often require 

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:07.219
 consume huge amounts of food 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.219
 to maintain its energy
