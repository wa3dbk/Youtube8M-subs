00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 yes that is a very young patient now 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.970
 or anyway 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.579
 I do not know what has 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:26.090
 Shortening your kitten with it 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:29.239
 are spending everything and have what they have 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.019
 for snuff are the only cat of 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.120
 five legs ill that is to say the 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.329
 is accompanied by eye effluent 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.610
 Nasal discharge often on position in the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.589
 cave with him looks very nice now 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.930
 even that one's going strong 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.079
 swollen greatly changed does 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.839
 also very hurt and we have there now 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.949
 a whole 15 c therapy heartily 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.470
 still over the occurrence through 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.140
 different pathogens different viruses 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.489
 Bacteria can be very similar 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.729
 look of the clinical symptomatology 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.600
 forth human mainly symptomatic 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.810
 treat 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.490
 we know many mattresses we sleep 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.490
 do not know so much about all that much yet 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.650
 special medications so whether certain 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.310
 antiviral drugs may be 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.140
 Act 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 and that's why we're doing it right now 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.280
 a study at the clinic 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.610
 cat flu patients and indeed 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 We also want to look antiviral 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.470
 drug whose interferon rommÃ© 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 whole antiviral drug on the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.280
 Park over cats generally with 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.390
 Cats with acute cat flu 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.479
 is effective and for the doctoral candidates 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.729
 a study by and for this study 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.690
 We also look for patients, ie patients 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.479
 have the phone battery known hours 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.430
 the uni study would come very nice 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.140
 if as many as possible would do so 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.479
 so we can just say afterwards 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.610
 has this drug actually what 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.590
 very expensive is in the context of the study 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.330
 not be paid but it actually 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.010
 very faithful and therefore we have to get out 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.930
 for which the drug has broken or 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.170
 can not 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.630
 how long will the study continue ? 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.150
 With this development the 24th 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.760
 when I think he needs us relatively 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.610
 many cats just started me 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.959
 I'm sure I'll think so for two years 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.240
 summer 2010 with itself still around it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.490
 We would be happy if possible 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.590
 Many people can report that 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.450
 Owners a great advantage to the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.120
 Treatments can be very good 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.950
 consuming to be very expensive and you have to 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.720
 then just pay a lot less 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.580
 would normally be necessary 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.200
 because we simply make money from studies 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.560
 then carry the rest of the treatment 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.270
 can be based on where or should the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.590
 pet owner eight related yes 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.090
 so it is very important that it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.920
 is treated at an early stage of the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.230
 Cat flu therefore should be a little bit 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.150
 salad pay particular attention to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.280
 little kitten on very hard 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.760
 but can also run in adults 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.910
 Cats occur and that is then must 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.370
 symptoms snuff sure did 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.080
 nasal discharge eyes exclusion too 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.060
 pinch your eyes when your eyes are like this 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.209
 shown together when the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.380
 blindfolds are very reddened today 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.750
 then our actions so breast solution 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.709
 drive in holstein or have long been in 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.530
 put the wall 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.780
 then the cats want to eat cough 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.100
 can also happen that during the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.420
 Turkish symptoms 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.090
 should be possible because this to the vet 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.260
 important is also to say 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.050
 Cats need to fight cat kills 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.040
 be vaccinated against the two-year-old 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.230
 infections herpesvirus and 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.130
 Qualification almost at live 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.550
 swallow the capsules 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.650
 Being involved with is very important 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.330
 The animals are vaccinated that every cat 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.170
 the cleaner the house held 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.170
 members to protect
