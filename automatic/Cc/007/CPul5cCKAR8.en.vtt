would<00:01:52.070> be<00:01:52.250> ideal<00:01:52.850> for<00:01:52.880> us<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:54.530> an

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
would be ideal for us it's an

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.249 
would be ideal for us it's an
intimidating<00:01:55.100> boat<00:01:55.369> I<00:01:55.399> think<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:57.110> beginning

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
intimidating boat I think the beginning

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.870 
intimidating boat I think the beginning
when<00:01:57.710> we<00:01:57.740> started<00:01:57.830> racing<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.729> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
when we started racing it in the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.109 
when we started racing it in the
Caribbean<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.979> was<00:02:01.130> we<00:02:01.490> were<00:02:01.610> very<00:02:01.759> afraid<00:02:01.909> of

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
Caribbean it was we were very afraid of

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.350 
Caribbean it was we were very afraid of
it<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.479> now<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:02.929> respect<00:02:03.649> it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
it and now we respect it

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.169 
it and now we respect it
Wow<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:07.310> have<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.429> chance<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.729> line<00:02:07.880> honors

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
Wow do we have a chance and line honors

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.290 
Wow do we have a chance and line honors
I<00:02:08.899> think<00:02:10.180> it'd<00:02:11.180> be<00:02:11.720> tough<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.260> bet<00:02:12.440> against<00:02:12.890> a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
I think it'd be tough to bet against a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.130 
I think it'd be tough to bet against a
boat<00:02:14.300> as<00:02:14.420> fast<00:02:14.630> as<00:02:14.810> ours

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140

higher than otherwise would be and the

whole objective is to get the bow out of

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
the water and these boats when they

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.480 
the water and these boats when they
start<00:03:38.810> going<00:03:38.930> 30<00:03:39.260> knots<00:03:39.500> they<00:03:39.800> are<00:03:39.920> very<00:03:40.190> wet

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
start going 30 knots they are very wet

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.970 
start going 30 knots they are very wet
bow<00:03:40.880> goes<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.930> because<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:42.380> you're<00:03:42.740> going

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
bow goes in because it's you're going

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.710 
bow goes in because it's you're going
faster<00:03:43.370> than<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.520> waves<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.240> run<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
faster than the waves and you run the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.420 
faster than the waves and you run the
wave<00:03:44.870> down<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.530> put<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.800> bow<00:03:45.950> in<00:03:46.220> and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
wave down and you put the bow in and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.910 
wave down and you put the bow in and
then<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.850> slow<00:03:47.090> down<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.540> our<00:03:48.200> idea<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.650> be

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
then you slow down and our idea is to be

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.430 
then you slow down and our idea is to be
fried<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.880> little<00:03:50.240> higher<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.750> be<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> little

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
fried a little higher and be a little

extreme beam canting keel and water
ballast<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.620> gains<00:04:18.890> both<00:04:19.280> again<00:04:19.880> stability

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
ballast so it gains both again stability

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.690 
ballast so it gains both again stability
from<00:04:20.540> all<00:04:20.720> three<00:04:20.989> well<00:04:21.590> they're<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:22.490> race

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
from all three well they're the race

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.240 
from all three well they're the race
committee<00:04:22.940> has<00:04:23.470> handed<00:04:24.470> us<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.770> bit<00:04:24.980> of<00:04:25.010> an

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
committee has handed us a bit of an

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.440 
committee has handed us a bit of an
impediment<00:04:25.580> which<00:04:26.240> is<00:04:26.480> they've<00:04:27.640> put<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:28.820> some

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
impediment which is they've put in some

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.260 
impediment which is they've put in some
gates<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.710> we<00:04:30.860> have<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.250> stay<00:04:31.460> south<00:04:31.760> of<00:04:31.970> both

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
gates that we have to stay south of both

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.930 
gates that we have to stay south of both
to<00:04:32.510> look<00:04:32.840> after<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.320> whales<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.920> to<00:04:34.370> stay<00:04:34.790> out

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
to look after the whales and to stay out

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.680 
to look after the whales and to stay out
of<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.240> ice<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:36.230> they're<00:04:36.410> sending<00:04:36.770> us<00:04:36.920> down<00:04:37.190> to

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
of the ice so they're sending us down to

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.450 
of the ice so they're sending us down to
you<00:04:38.690> know<00:04:38.810> around<00:04:39.080> where<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.590> Titanic<00:04:40.040> you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
you know around where the Titanic you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.330 
you know around where the Titanic you
know<00:04:40.640> hit<00:04:40.940> her<00:04:41.180> iceberg<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.890> that<00:04:43.070> adds

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
know hit her iceberg and so that adds

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.370 
know hit her iceberg and so that adds
about<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:43.790> hundred<00:04:44.330> miles<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.020> racecourse

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
about a hundred miles to the racecourse

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.370 
about a hundred miles to the racecourse
and<00:04:46.040> so<00:04:46.220> that's<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.720> that'll<00:04:47.720> make<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.020> record

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
and so that's a that'll make the record

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.470 
and so that's a that'll make the record
harder<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:49.040> us<00:04:49.190> because<00:04:49.670> we<00:04:49.910> have<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.240> sell

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
harder for us because we have to sell

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.100 
harder for us because we have to sell
more<00:04:50.870> real<00:04:51.290> miles

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
more real miles

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.980 
more real miles
Comanche<00:04:54.380> I<00:04:54.550> think<00:04:55.550> our<00:04:55.700> peak<00:04:55.910> speeds<00:04:56.300> have

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
Comanche I think our peak speeds have

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.070 
Comanche I think our peak speeds have
been<00:04:57.020> in<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.590> mid<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.460> high<00:04:58.490> 30s<00:04:58.970> but<00:04:59.840> that's

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
been in the mid to high 30s but that's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.120 
been in the mid to high 30s but that's
just<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.590> peak<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:02.750> boat<00:05:02.990> isn't<00:05:03.440> able<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.830> hang

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
just a peak the boat isn't able to hang

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.010 
just a peak the boat isn't able to hang
on<00:05:04.370> those<00:05:04.550> beads<00:05:04.820> for<00:05:05.060> very<00:05:05.240> long<00:05:05.480> but<00:05:05.720> we<00:05:05.870> are

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
on those beads for very long but we are

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.540 
on those beads for very long but we are
able<00:05:06.170> to<00:05:06.410> hang<00:05:06.590> on<00:05:06.800> speeds<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.430> low

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
able to hang on speeds in the low

able to hang on speeds in the low
