00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
really surprised that I managed to do it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.699 
really surprised that I managed to do it
because<00:03:49.620> they<00:03:49.830> look<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.010> difficult<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.880> stitch

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
because they look so difficult to stitch

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.530 
because they look so difficult to stitch
but<00:03:52.709> once<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.070> got<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.310> hang<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:54.000> really

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
but once I got the hang of it I really

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.220 
but once I got the hang of it I really
enjoyed<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
enjoyed it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.020
