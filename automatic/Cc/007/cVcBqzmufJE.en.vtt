of about six ounces so a significant

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
of about six ounces so a significant
amount<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> weight<00:01:00.870> savings<00:01:01.469> virtually<00:01:02.280> a

hundred percent of players wear

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.160 
hundred percent of players wear
compression<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.510> we've<00:01:06.659> seen<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
compression and now what we've seen is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
compression and now what we've seen is
through<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.979> use<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.189> compression<00:01:08.880> shorts

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
through the use of compression shorts

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
through the use of compression shorts
it<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.750> afforded<00:01:10.260> us<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.500> whole<00:01:10.680> new<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it really afforded us a whole new way of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
it really afforded us a whole new way of
looking<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> uniform<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.689> athletes<00:01:13.110> are

looking at the uniform as athletes are

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
underneath their uniform so with that we

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.850 
underneath their uniform so with that we
have<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> opportunity<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.710> much
