00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
physics in this game remind me of the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870 
physics in this game remind me of the
chase<00:01:22.020> scene<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.650> terminator<00:01:23.250> 2<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.850> looks

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
chase scene from terminator 2 it looks

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.990 
chase scene from terminator 2 it looks
good<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.140> unrealistic<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.610> fun

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
good but it's just unrealistic it's fun

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
good but it's just unrealistic it's fun
though<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> fun<00:01:27.689> change<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.140> pace<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
though it's a fun change of pace I like

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
though it's a fun change of pace I like
when<00:01:29.040> first-person<00:01:29.790> shooters<00:01:30.180> mix<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
when first-person shooters mix up the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
when first-person shooters mix up the
gameplay<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.579> first

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
gameplay and it's not all just first

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
gameplay and it's not all just first
person<00:01:33.659> shooting<00:01:34.049> saying<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.310> game

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
person shooting saying all that the game

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
person shooting saying all that the game
didn't<00:01:35.970> captivate<00:01:36.630> me<00:01:36.659> didn't<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.439> any<00:01:37.710> wow

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
didn't captivate me didn't have any wow

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.670 
didn't captivate me didn't have any wow
moments<00:01:38.670> everything<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.689> good<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.439> nothing

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
moments everything is good but nothing

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.940 
moments everything is good but nothing
is<00:01:41.220> great<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.390> good<00:01:43.020> explanation<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is great a good explanation of what I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.389 
is great a good explanation of what I
mean<00:01:44.220> would<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.890> movie

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
mean would be like a kind of good movie
