00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
sandwich so stubble back and then you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.319 
sandwich so stubble back and then you
just<00:00:57.180> tell<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.870> tongue<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.829> flip<00:00:59.129> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
enough times it morphs into one card so
that's<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.610> pretty<00:01:08.850> easy<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that's just pretty easy all you got to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
that's just pretty easy all you got to
do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:11.010> triple<00:01:11.460> lift<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.000> just

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
do is just triple lift and then just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.870 
do is just triple lift and then just
keep<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.920> turning<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> put<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
keep on turning it and then you put it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
keep on turning it and then you put it
once<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:15.659> inspected<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> they're<00:01:16.619> amazed

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
once they inspected and they're amazed

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.120 
once they inspected and they're amazed
and<00:01:17.220> everything<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.479> keep<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> turning

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and everything you just keep on turning

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.450 
and everything you just keep on turning
it<00:01:20.250> again<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.750> three<00:01:21.960> cards<00:01:24.590> until<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:29.100> cards

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it again the three cards until the cards

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
it again the three cards until the cards
are<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> say<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.720> walk

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
are like that and you say then they walk

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.850 
are like that and you say then they walk
back<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:33.020> another<00:01:34.020> trick<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
back so now another trick that you can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
back so now another trick that you can
do<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.579> course<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
do is of course you have to have it in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
do is of course you have to have it in
the<00:01:36.630> bottom<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> start<00:01:38.850> off

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the bottom this one I like to start off

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
the bottom this one I like to start off
with<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> spread<00:01:39.799> that<00:01:40.799> way<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.159> see

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
with a spread that way they can see

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
with a spread that way they can see
there's<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:42.299> card<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.960> face<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:44.180> for<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
there's that card is face down for and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.249 
there's that card is face down for and
then<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> pick<00:01:48.630> however<00:01:49.049> many

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
then it's time to pick however many

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.539 
then it's time to pick however many
cards<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> have

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
cards that they want so if you have

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
cards that they want so if you have
group<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> pick<00:01:51.810> several<00:01:52.079> cards<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.590> I'm

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
group you can pick several cards but I'm

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
group you can pick several cards but I'm
just<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> pick<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.280> okay<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.329> we<00:01:54.450> got

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
just going to pick one okay so we got

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.370 
just going to pick one okay so we got
the<00:01:54.990> jack<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.890> spades<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.500> they<00:01:58.500> take<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.740> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
the jack of spades so they take it and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.920 
the jack of spades so they take it and
you<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> tell<00:02:01.799> them<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> when<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.659> take<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you just tell them and when they take it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.289 
you just tell them and when they take it
you<00:02:04.229> flip<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.399> quick<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.180> where

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you flip it over really quick to where

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
you flip it over really quick to where
that<00:02:06.840> double<00:02:07.229> sided<00:02:07.409> card<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.160> top<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.640> they

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that double sided card is on top so they

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.570 
that double sided card is on top so they
think<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.300> face<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.430> just

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
think that it's face down and you just

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.890 
think that it's face down and you just
tell<00:02:11.760> them<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.940> put<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.330> there<00:02:12.540> anywhere

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
tell them to put it in there anywhere

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.869
