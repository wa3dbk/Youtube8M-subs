00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 do not 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.760
 up to date 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:54.890
 and the tutorial on how to make a world 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.380
 very well flat and completely 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.540
 daily in addition to reading 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.089
 how to make them elegant I will show you 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.890
 how to do it from different materials and 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.950
 the thing is like this you have to have 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.259
 They have to know the ide 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.259
 but the seconds have to know 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.649
 has to about the idea of ​​some block 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.460
 for example of vido want to make a one 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.369
 video or blue pencil and good you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.079
 first one has a power is the glass if 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.539
 you have the first soft item there 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.270
 have peters the number that appears 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.460
 at the side is the leader of this block 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.429
 then you can grab I'm going to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.329
 make a world of sandstone that 24 or is 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:48.450
 24 when you are good like that but friendly 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.520
 well they do not have in their mind then 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 you appear just the name what 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.310
 what they have to do is go to canon and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 touch 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 efe 3 and keep it and there you can take 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.590
 the effect and see that now a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.770
 number in parentheses good if number 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.649
 is the leader of the block only counts the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:16.140
 number neither the 0 nor the numeral 1 2 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.460
 33 degrees and so good let's continue now what 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.260
 what we have to do is first that 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.110
 everything is a half a world of brightness to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.960
 see if you can the ide is 20 then 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.080
 we go out and let a player create a 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.740
 again we will call it the name no 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.830
 it matters but the club already by glass 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.390
 let's put creative and the world flat 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.319
 as usual 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 super healthy here and customize was 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.950
 appear this good good present 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.890
 then and here to see this 2 points 1 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:56.959
 village and 2 2 points 1 delete again 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:00.080
 since then without erasing the 2 2 points or the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.020
 2 points a king and they put the leader of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.100
 blocks that you want I think it was 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.170
 24.4 20 and that's going to make the world 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.890
 have nothing else a depth block 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.420
 already going to start 2020 for example I 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.340
 I think I have three blocks of 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.640
 good depth let's put using 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.970
 pressel carries for starter is how they see 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.090
 the one they put on the left is going to be the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.130
 below that they set to be the first of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.459
 the left is going to be low and the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.730
 last on the right is going to be the first 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.160
 that goes above all we can accept 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.110
 create a new world unloads the world and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.730
 here they will know how they see this is very 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.640
 strange because the world of life then 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.750
 the bottom with three blocks of 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.140
 so then to be able to make a 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.500
 material world that you want 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.849
 but it necessarily has to make 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:06.000
 blocks can not be slab and can not be 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.000
 wall or any of these materials 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.660
 and any of these materials from this 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.370
 month and you can guess that nothing bad that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.970
 they are squares are what are blocks 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.709
 those who put themselves like this or any of this 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.710
 they understand everything that are square 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.669
 I'll try to see if you can with a 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.030
 creation mass we are going 58 we are going to 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.110
 Putting the world in the change does not matter 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:40.069
 customize by mister understand it in 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:46.610
 vein presets delete from 22 points to 2 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:50.479
 points 1 and they put 59 58 euro that was and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.550
 they put their I'm going to do it a depth 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.520
 of four blocks we will absorb is 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.690
 well month ago we will accept to create 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.870
 world new here is going to load worlds ready 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.470
 but of tables cárter 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.230
 this is all good to do it would be a 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.170
 adventure map things like that things that 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.840
 I'm going to not have them like that for different 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:20.460
 days let's say me he I have world of 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:25.990
 I have a world of his friends 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.210
 and then launch from 05 and this would be the 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.100
 technique can do with any block 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.030
 in any block less 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:40.600
 and good those that are objects and that 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:49.340
 well that would be the whole tutorial 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:53.000
 because they see how easy and good that has been 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.070
 been everything and see you 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.820
 wait differently before we go to 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.310
 follow us 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.440
 those that for example when you 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.290
 we put the flat world the depths 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.070
 nothing more than four blocks but with this 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:12.060
 you are going to be able to put a normal world 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:14.430
 to six types of land and stone but 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.980
 with more presence or by putting more 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.090
 numbers as I showed you that you the 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.770
 number number they put is the 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.080
 good depth that I wanted to say and 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.599
 this 102 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.599
 until next time and goodbye
