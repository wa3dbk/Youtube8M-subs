00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.370
 so all lost to the 12 doors of the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.139
 minecraft adventskalenders we have 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 in fact the Ã¶sv was about it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 incredibly fast and well 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.070
 Nonetheless, it works 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 continue with the next thing and there that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.769
 last time the little rats 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.810
 turnouts for many years 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.590
 interesting because I have one more today 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.970
 new look in 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.769
 Last time we had the guys 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.969
 one mutually from both sides 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 can close and open 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.360
 he has a little knowledge again 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.579
 behind it had seen who 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 a bit complex at the front and that's the thing 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 which is not necessarily so easy 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 comes to logical superior from brian 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 What's the best way to do that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.920
 But there are so small prefabricated 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.809
 circuit and I have here again 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.399
 one selected namely what would be 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.800
 if we do not switch at the front 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 but wanted a button one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.949
 button that ensures that sekt that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.840
 the result is exactly the same 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.430
 means that the door is permanently open 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500
 Although I only briefly once 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.239
 short button signals from Ghana 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
 that means we print briefly and once 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.020
 partners usually have a time of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.229
 so many seconds until something happens 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 Incidentally, if I do differently so 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.409
 a second approximately finally 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.000
 the thing again 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.009
 but how can we do that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.799
 always a longer lasting one 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.030
 signal is and that's exactly this 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.610
 functions like here we press the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 button door open and stays open 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 press the button here door closes 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 itself and therefore remains an extended 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
 take off the signal that lasts long and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.869
 There is also a special one for that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.880
 circuit is the deep floppy front and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 that is one of the foundations 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.100
 if we already took that with her 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.400
 we still have this to do with this 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.500
 to take 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.470
 the thing is quite small but of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.610
 I just put it on it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 even never managed that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 just contain it somewhere 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 has seen mum has triggered 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.880
 just a basic training you get 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.040
 in a normal learning injury in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.020
 Weimar appropriates do not press the following 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.689
 button and the lamp stays for example 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
 There again pulled on button lamp 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.049
 often stays as actual pressures 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.490
 Of course I have a little bit now 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.840
 made smaller not completely built 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.000
 here in front you can do it again in 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.799
 two lines are very complete 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.970
 no matter where the signal arrives up here 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.170
 which way from this side 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.239
 or from this side 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.810
 this one stays up after each time 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.550
 button repeatedly press out like that and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.830
 he actually has to do the following 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 two runs are switched from one another and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.610
 they push the block back and forth and that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.440
 happens mutually when the block 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.239
 just on one side is then 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.319
 a signal comes through when the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.209
 Block pushed to the other side 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.650
 no signal will come through and the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.709
 Runways are made that way 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.129
 lock each other in the frontier 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.470
 location 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.150
 that pulls back that expands 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.650
 theoretically he also gets one 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.959
 signal that he knows himself again 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.390
 would express but is not because 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.459
 the so expressed but it is changing 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.580
 still back there the signal short 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.900
 time is out and this one before he leaves 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.310
 can print back first 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.660
 so he needs more 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.489
 time to press again 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.569
 and that always happens reciprocally me 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.170
 I hope that is reasonably understandable 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.940
 to explain 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.830
 at least I almost stung again 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.159
 luckily we are quite simple 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.920
 take easy and transphobia 21 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.250
 constantly so opposite but middle 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.769
 show blog blog blog are like this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.730
 Every corner would have a torch on top 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.760
 he does not finish well in brown 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.459
 small output that is when we do that 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.080
 want to pull us to torches 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.090
 put 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.330
 who the peter because it is there and 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.989
 Here the output sun grabs first time yes 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.350
 what come out and then wait buck 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.660
 changes is and stays that way 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.300
 and sits down again you can too 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.560
 do not accept portions as set 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.780
 if you want to move somewhere else 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.830
 do something to the side of course that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.190
 could also be different underground 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.410
 do 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 so we do the car and the or 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.970
 It lies completely week of two 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.190
 side signal to heads over there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.510
 that one from the other and down here 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.880
 then the output somehow get out of it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.350
 was anything is possible and quite simple 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.090
 Just have to go back today 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.530
 even a thing the extension 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.360
 done without ground circuit if you 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.980
 she does not see or learn anywhere 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.540
 then you can not do that if something 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.750
 special would like to make like his cottage 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.220
 or something that is quite useful good 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.050
 tomorrow comes another kind of 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.110
 Maybe videos at this time 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.700
 short-wave riddle of the theory film 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.990
 I would still have my superior one 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.210
 I'm not planning anymore though 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.620
 maybe there will be something again 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.940
 This time I am for fun 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.890
 I hope that despite everything 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.020
 we must see interesting today 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.020
 the next time we crash and goodbye
