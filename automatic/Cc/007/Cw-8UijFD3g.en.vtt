00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
for a left mid and I was thinking

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.370 
for a left mid and I was thinking
Giovinco<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.299> awesome<00:01:06.510> i<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.110> lot<00:01:07.350> cheaper

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Giovinco but awesome i was a lot cheaper

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.219 
Giovinco but awesome i was a lot cheaper
so<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:07.979> thought<00:01:08.189> i'd<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.490> him<00:01:08.760> first<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.110> i

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
so i thought i'd go for him first and i

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
so i thought i'd go for him first and i
know<00:01:10.290> he's<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.040> good<00:01:11.400> all-round<00:01:11.580> stats<00:01:12.060> as

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
know he's got a good all-round stats as

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
know he's got a good all-round stats as
well<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.540> he<00:01:12.600> may<00:01:12.750> suit<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.830> left<00:01:14.040> mid

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
well so he may suit the left mid

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.429 
well so he may suit the left mid
position<00:01:14.310> better<00:01:14.670> than<00:01:14.939> Giovinco<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
position better than Giovinco so when I

okay<00:01:29.340> i<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.520> i<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.509> i<00:01:30.540> make<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:31.049> there

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
okay i think i see i make that bit there

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.929 
okay i think i see i make that bit there
and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.799> outbid<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.460> i<00:01:32.520> think<00:01:32.790> i<00:01:32.909> just

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and then i get outbid and i think i just

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
and then i get outbid and i think i just
leave<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.720> end<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> goes<00:01:34.159> 46.7<00:01:35.159> k

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
leave this in the end it goes 46.7 k

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
leave this in the end it goes 46.7 k
eventually<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> 100<00:01:37.049> coins<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.500> than

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
eventually which is 100 coins more than

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.319 
eventually which is 100 coins more than
I<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> would<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.180> won

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
I just been actually so I would have won
it<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> decided<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> leave<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.070> i<00:01:41.100> thought

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
come up against a premier league team I

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.430 
come up against a premier league team I
think<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.900> Allah<00:02:42.080> gets<00:02:42.260> things

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
think it was and is Allah gets things

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.809 
think it was and is Allah gets things
started<00:02:42.470> off<00:02:42.769> pretty<00:02:42.980> well<00:02:43.250> he<00:02:43.430> walks<00:02:43.610> inside

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
started off pretty well he walks inside

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.150 
started off pretty well he walks inside
and<00:02:44.239> he<00:02:44.600> didn't<00:02:44.840> really<00:02:44.959> come<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.410> cover<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.799> so

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and he didn't really come to cover me so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.740 
and he didn't really come to cover me so
I<00:02:46.190> thought<00:02:46.340> why<00:02:46.549> not<00:02:46.580> step<00:02:46.850> inside<00:02:47.180> bring<00:02:47.630> his

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
I thought why not step inside bring his

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.360 
I thought why not step inside bring his
long<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.049> his<00:02:48.140> left<00:02:48.319> foot<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:48.980> his<00:02:49.100> first

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
long to his left foot and get his first

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
long to his left foot and get his first

that<00:03:32.959> much<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.769> that's<00:03:33.950> why<00:03:34.069> I<00:03:34.100> decided<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.489> put

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
that much so that's why I decided to put

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:35.979 
that much so that's why I decided to put
three<00:03:34.850> games<00:03:35.060> into<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.390> episode<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:35.930> us

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
look very good the reason i've been

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.580 
look very good the reason i've been
using<00:03:54.920> blurs<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.579> because<00:03:56.049> with<00:03:57.049> dark<00:03:57.319> colors

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590

using blurs is because with dark colors
on<00:03:57.680> youtube<00:03:57.950> at<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.130> moment<00:03:58.489> they're<00:03:58.639> failing

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
on youtube at the moment they're failing

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.390 
on youtube at the moment they're failing
and<00:03:59.450> making<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.350> screen<00:04:00.590> bleed<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.220> that's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
and making the screen bleed so that's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.860 
and making the screen bleed so that's
the<00:04:01.459> reason<00:04:01.489> i've<00:04:01.700> been<00:04:01.819> using<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:02.720> it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
the reason i've been using it but it's

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.300 
the reason i've been using it but it's
time<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.079> go<00:04:03.170> back<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.470> fades<00:04:03.680> this<00:04:03.889> episode<00:04:04.190> so

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:48.559 
bellucci rising in the area I don't

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.399 
bellucci rising in the area I don't
think<00:06:48.770> it<00:06:48.919> was<00:06:49.779> particularly<00:06:50.779> challenged<00:06:51.259> in

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
think it was particularly challenged in

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
think it was particularly challenged in
the<00:06:51.559> air<00:06:51.740> but<00:06:53.229> no<00:06:54.229> is<00:06:54.409> a<00:06:54.439> good<00:06:54.649> header<00:06:54.830> and<00:06:55.159> then

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:55.429 
the air but no is a good header and then

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:57.459 
the air but no is a good header and then
the<00:06:55.610> bran<00:06:56.089> his<00:06:56.179> goalkeeper<00:06:56.689> out<00:06:56.809> on<00:06:56.959> Marchisio
