00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.340
 we need some scissors a mulet infrared tweezers that will cost us 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.959
 about 20 cents 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.689
 if a ballpoint pen with led lights that we go to kiril in some pass of gifts 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 the idea is to replace this Monday 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 nobody removed the plug 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.030
 we alert to hood 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.330
 the multinational 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 with the tweezers we will remove 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 it is important to look at how this is mounted 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 because later we will see reconstruct it with showed the red team 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 in a while keep the original way to rebuild 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.810
 to rectify that the leg cuts this negative we can observe that in the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.840
 metallic part between the Spanish dt 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.800
 we do not know our red team 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.940
 what is the negative part in this case of ireland 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.140
 gamesa was to recognize because the negative leg is the shortest 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.380
 To make sure we are not mistaken, we put the salted estuary in infrared 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.240
 we separated the negative part 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 and with the scissors we cut it more or less at the same height 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
 let light 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.729
 you are going to give it the form that had the originals excellent 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.589
 yes before and I know maybe infrared 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.729
 to work more comfortably 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.949
 we will remove the batteries 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.059
 and the metal lever 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.059
 Internet cafe 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 to dunk our infrared lens 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.599
 At the bottom of the plastic structure, we will be angry. 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.459
 go long 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.459
 and the rest of the team 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.479
 similar 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.479
 today the original exhibition 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.059
 are the ones to put the batteries making sure that the positive pole 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.149
 on the bottom 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.099
 we also put the metal plate 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.799
 fry we will check that they always work with a digital camera are capable of 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 recognize the infrared 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.479
 we present this new structure 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.639
 the thugs the hood 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.469
 we already have our new infrared pointer
