cells<00:01:57.520> I've<00:01:58.520> run<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> truck<00:01:59.090> three<00:01:59.330> times

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
cells I've run the truck three times

cells I've run the truck three times
four<00:02:00.170> times<00:02:00.440> on<00:02:00.770> three<00:02:01.130> cells<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:01.789> one

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
four times on three cells just one

four times on three cells just one
battery<00:02:02.180> three<00:02:02.720> cells<00:02:02.990> 11.1<00:02:03.710> volt<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.390> I

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
battery three cells 11.1 volt and I

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.560 
battery three cells 11.1 volt and I
managed<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.750> bend<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.979> motor<00:02:07.220> mount<00:02:07.570> pretty

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
managed to bend the motor mount pretty

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.699 
managed to bend the motor mount pretty
much<00:02:08.769> out<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:10.009> shape<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:11.540> turn<00:02:11.870> ruined<00:02:12.440> my

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
much out of shape and in turn ruined my

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:23.020 
much out of shape and in turn ruined my
opinion<00:02:13.400> year<00:02:13.700> actually<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:21.370> here<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.580> I

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
opinion year actually that so here is I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.910 
opinion year actually that so here is I
don't<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:23.600> they'll<00:02:23.959> see<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.410> or<00:02:24.620> not<00:02:24.650> in

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
don't know if they'll see this or not in

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.759 
don't know if they'll see this or not in
the<00:02:25.010> camera<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:25.640> there<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.810> my<00:02:27.049> old<00:02:27.320> pinion

gear<00:02:28.989> as<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.320> motor<00:02:30.530> mount<00:02:30.769> bent<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.400> noticed<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
gear as the motor mount bent I noticed a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.880 
gear as the motor mount bent I noticed a
little<00:02:32.360> more<00:02:32.570> chattering<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.350> didn't<00:02:33.739> really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
little more chattering I didn't really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.710 
little more chattering I didn't really
know<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.280> was<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.880> then<00:02:35.000> pretty<00:02:35.269> soon<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
know what it was and then pretty soon it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.140 
know what it was and then pretty soon it
was<00:02:35.810> apparent<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:37.670> right<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.030> not

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
was apparent that all right it's not

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.220 
was apparent that all right it's not
just<00:02:38.209> chattering<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:40.150> major<00:02:41.150> damage<00:02:41.780> to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
just chattering it's major damage to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.710 
just chattering it's major damage to
this<00:02:42.440> I'm<00:02:42.980> lucky<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.400> didn't<00:02:43.610> ruin<00:02:43.700> my<00:02:43.850> spur

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720

gear<00:02:45.049> which<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.680> hardened<00:02:46.250> steel<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.329> was

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
gear which is hardened steel and it was

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.259 
gear which is hardened steel and it was
$30<00:02:48.079> for<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:50.090> now<00:02:52.269> garnish

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269

you can see that motor mount plate right
there<00:03:43.430> basically<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.610> an<00:03:44.700> L<00:03:44.940> design<00:03:45.390> motor

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
there basically it's an L design motor

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.960 
there basically it's an L design motor
mount<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.069> bottom<00:03:47.400> mounts<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
mount so the bottom mounts to the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.199 
mount so the bottom mounts to the
chassis<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.690> then<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.349> front<00:03:49.620> plate<00:03:50.519> mounts

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
chassis and then the front plate mounts

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.630 
chassis and then the front plate mounts
to<00:03:51.360> your<00:03:51.390> motor<00:03:51.690> itself<00:03:52.140> what<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.220> happened

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
to your motor itself what it happened

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.479 
to your motor itself what it happened
was<00:03:53.790> with<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> amount<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.450> torque<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.980> started

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
was with the amount of torque it started

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.089 
was with the amount of torque it started
to<00:03:56.670> bend<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.269> motor<00:03:57.480> up<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.170> lift<00:03:58.650> up<00:03:58.860> and

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
to bend the motor up and lift up and

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.420 
to bend the motor up and lift up and
that<00:03:59.310> would<00:03:59.660> mess<00:04:00.660> up<00:04:00.840> my<00:04:00.989> gear<00:04:01.260> mesh<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:02.340> what

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
that would mess up my gear mesh so what

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.069 
that would mess up my gear mesh so what
I<00:04:02.489> had<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.060> get<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.329> hose<00:04:03.540> clamp

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
I had to do is get a hose clamp

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.530 
I had to do is get a hose clamp
some<00:04:04.440> faulting<00:04:04.799> some<00:04:05.040> soft<00:04:05.250> foam<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.760> just

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
some faulting some soft foam and just

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.630 
some faulting some soft foam and just
hold<00:04:07.049> down<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.500> backside<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.100> motor<00:04:08.310> to

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
hold down the backside of the motor to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.970 
hold down the backside of the motor to
keep<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.940> flat<00:04:09.780> I'll<00:04:10.109> probably<00:04:10.350> cut<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.769> off

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
keep it flat I'll probably cut this off

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.130 
keep it flat I'll probably cut this off
and<00:04:11.190> make<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> little<00:04:11.489> shorter<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.209> so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
and make you a little shorter and so

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.170 
and make you a little shorter and so
it's<00:04:13.319> not<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:14.190> know<00:04:14.280> sticking<00:04:14.970> out

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
it's not so you know sticking out

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.229 
it's not so you know sticking out
whatever<00:04:15.510> looks<00:04:15.720> terrible<00:04:16.169> but<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
whatever looks terrible but just the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.300 
whatever looks terrible but just the
motor<00:04:18.510> plate<00:04:18.840> itself<00:04:19.289> is<00:04:19.530> not<00:04:19.739> strong<00:04:20.100> enough

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
motor plate itself is not strong enough

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.370 
motor plate itself is not strong enough
to<00:04:20.459> hold<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.700> motor<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.299> that's<00:04:21.780> just<00:04:22.079> three

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
to hold the motor and that's just three

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.980 
to hold the motor and that's just three
cells<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:22.979> not<00:04:23.160> four<00:04:23.700> cells<00:04:24.030> on<00:04:24.419> five<00:04:24.660> cells

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
cells it's not four cells on five cells

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.050 
cells it's not four cells on five cells
or<00:04:25.229> even<00:04:25.260> six<00:04:25.800> cells<00:04:26.039> which<00:04:26.310> destruct

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
or even six cells which destruct

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.090 
or even six cells which destruct
you<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.229> motor<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.530> speak<00:04:28.740> controller

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
you know the motor to speak controller

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.600 
you know the motor to speak controller
is<00:04:29.310> supposed<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.789> handle

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.050 

so<00:04:33.240> let's<00:04:33.629> go<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:33.990> made<00:04:34.500> just<00:04:35.189> out<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.580> lexan

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
so let's go on I made just out of lexan

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.409 
so let's go on I made just out of lexan
just<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:37.080> plate<00:04:37.500> as<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.919> can<00:04:38.250> see<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.330> all

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
just this plate as you can see and all

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.050 
just this plate as you can see and all
my<00:04:39.539> electronics<00:04:40.139> are<00:04:40.289> down<00:04:40.409> there<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:41.060> mounted

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
my electronics are down there I mounted

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.610 
my electronics are down there I mounted
the<00:04:42.379> speed<00:04:43.379> controller<00:04:43.860> here<00:04:44.129> -<00:04:44.340> double-sided

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
the speed controller here - double-sided

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.619 
the speed controller here - double-sided
tape<00:04:46.620> right<00:04:47.039> on<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.819> top<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.180> plate<00:04:48.389> as

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
tape right on the top of the plate as

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:55.520 
tape right on the top of the plate as
well<00:04:48.870> as<00:04:49.020> my<00:04:49.199> switch<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:52.969> had<00:04:53.969> to<00:04:54.270> know<00:04:55.199> if<00:04:55.439> I

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
well as my switch I had to know if I

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.890 
well as my switch I had to know if I
went<00:04:55.740> into<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.039> before<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:57.409> had<00:04:58.409> to<00:04:58.710> change

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
went into this before I had to change

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.089 
went into this before I had to change
this<00:05:01.129> spur<00:05:02.129> gear<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.259> 43<00:05:04.259> tooth<00:05:04.530> from<00:05:04.949> a

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
this spur gear to a 43 tooth from a

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.209 
this spur gear to a 43 tooth from a
savage<00:05:05.340> flux<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.409> had<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.740> change<00:05:07.979> an

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
savage flux and I had to change an

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.809 
savage flux and I had to change an
inside<00:05:08.669> year<00:05:09.150> idle<00:05:09.900> gear<00:05:10.370> assembly<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.789> a

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
inside year idle gear assembly to a

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.200 
inside year idle gear assembly to a
solid<00:05:12.740> gear<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:14.099> give<00:05:14.250> me<00:05:14.400> my<00:05:14.639> forward<00:05:15.030> and

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
solid gear to give me my forward and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.480 
solid gear to give me my forward and
reverse<00:05:15.539> switch<00:05:15.599> now<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.080> have<00:05:16.349> and<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.310> works

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
reverse switch now I have and it works

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.850 
reverse switch now I have and it works
perfectly<00:05:17.940> fine<00:05:20.090> whether<00:05:21.090> than<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.860> just

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
perfectly fine whether than that just

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.260 
perfectly fine whether than that just
that<00:05:23.009> one<00:05:23.069> issue<00:05:23.340> with<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:23.699> motor<00:05:23.940> mount

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
that one issue with the motor mount

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.119 
that one issue with the motor mount
which<00:05:24.629> I<00:05:24.779> pretty<00:05:25.169> much<00:05:25.289> figured<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.919> was<00:05:26.069> gonna

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
which I pretty much figured it was gonna

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.890 
which I pretty much figured it was gonna
happen<00:05:26.550> because<00:05:26.639> my<00:05:26.819> mounted<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.419> motor<00:05:27.449> I

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
happen because my mounted the motor I

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.869 
happen because my mounted the motor I
could<00:05:28.409> actually<00:05:28.560> lift<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.190> motor<00:05:29.370> up<00:05:29.669> and

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 
could actually lift the motor up and

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.670 
could actually lift the motor up and
down<00:05:30.029> and<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.330> was<00:05:30.419> felt<00:05:30.810> loose<00:05:31.139> it<00:05:31.409> didn't

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
down and it was felt loose it didn't

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.649 
down and it was felt loose it didn't
feel<00:05:31.770> real<00:05:32.039> strong<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.210> thought<00:05:33.419> wow

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
feel real strong and I thought wow

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.420 
feel real strong and I thought wow
that's<00:05:33.960> gonna<00:05:34.229> be<00:05:34.409> a<00:05:34.439> lot<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:34.650> power<00:05:34.919> is<00:05:35.279> that

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
that's gonna be a lot of power is that

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.219 
that's gonna be a lot of power is that
gonna<00:05:35.580> be<00:05:35.669> able<00:05:35.819> to<00:05:35.909> hold<00:05:36.090> steady<00:05:36.569> and<00:05:36.750> hold<00:05:36.960> in

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
gonna be able to hold steady and hold in

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.129 
gonna be able to hold steady and hold in
place<00:05:37.529> and<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.580> didn't<00:05:38.819> and<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.690> know<00:05:39.779> this<00:05:39.990> is

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
place and it didn't and you know this is

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.719 
place and it didn't and you know this is
gonna<00:05:40.259> help<00:05:40.440> hold<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.830> right<00:05:41.129> down<00:05:41.310> into<00:05:41.580> the

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
gonna help hold that right down into the

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.490 
gonna help hold that right down into the
groove<00:05:42.120> of<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.509> motor<00:05:42.719> mount<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.349> motor

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
groove of the motor mount the motor

it's gonna eliminate any kind of lifting
of<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.279> motor<00:05:56.580> with<00:05:56.819> all<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.060> torque<00:05:57.419> I

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
of the motor with all that torque I

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.499 
of the motor with all that torque I
probably<00:05:59.039> won't<00:05:59.370> run<00:05:59.639> this<00:05:59.819> truck<00:06:00.060> on<00:06:00.210> sick

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
probably won't run this truck on sick

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.510 
probably won't run this truck on sick
cells<00:06:00.779> because<00:06:01.199> I<00:06:01.229> run<00:06:01.529> it<00:06:01.620> on<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:01.770> single<00:06:01.979> 3

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
cells because I run it on a single 3

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.850 
cells because I run it on a single 3
cell<00:06:02.729> battery<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.389> does<00:06:03.539> wheelies<00:06:03.960> it

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
cell battery and it does wheelies it

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.820 
cell battery and it does wheelies it
goes<00:06:05.069> probably<00:06:05.580> 35<00:06:06.300> which<00:06:06.990> isn't<00:06:07.229> too<00:06:07.469> bad<00:06:07.500> for

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
goes probably 35 which isn't too bad for

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.350 
goes probably 35 which isn't too bad for
this<00:06:07.949> sized<00:06:08.190> truck<00:06:08.460> if<00:06:08.639> I<00:06:08.729> bumped<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.120> up<00:06:09.180> the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
this sized truck if I bumped it up the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.749 
this sized truck if I bumped it up the
four<00:06:09.569> cells<00:06:09.870> that's<00:06:10.800> all<00:06:11.039> you<00:06:11.219> would<00:06:11.310> need<00:06:11.490> I

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
four cells that's all you would need I

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.730 
four cells that's all you would need I
don't<00:06:12.029> think<00:06:12.599> you<00:06:12.750> could<00:06:12.900> even<00:06:12.960> drive<00:06:13.440> it<00:06:13.469> with

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
don't think you could even drive it with

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.779 
don't think you could even drive it with
six<00:06:14.039> cells<00:06:14.279> it<00:06:14.430> would<00:06:14.490> just<00:06:14.669> be

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
six cells it would just be

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.059 
six cells it would just be
uncontrollable<00:06:15.089> it<00:06:15.779> would<00:06:15.960> be<00:06:16.080> too<00:06:16.529> fast<00:06:16.770> too

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
uncontrollable it would be too fast too

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.920 
uncontrollable it would be too fast too
much<00:06:17.219> power<00:06:17.490> it's<00:06:18.000> just<00:06:20.060> too<00:06:21.060> much<00:06:21.270> for<00:06:21.779> this

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
much power it's just too much for this

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.999 
much power it's just too much for this
type<00:06:22.139> of<00:06:22.169> application<00:06:24.349> but<00:06:25.349> even<00:06:25.740> with<00:06:25.889> the

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
type of application but even with the

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.409 
type of application but even with the
single<00:06:26.310> 3-cell<00:06:26.699> battery<00:06:26.729> I'm<00:06:27.089> gonna<00:06:27.210> show<00:06:27.389> a

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
single 3-cell battery I'm gonna show a

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.369 
single 3-cell battery I'm gonna show a
little<00:06:27.599> running<00:06:27.960> video<00:06:28.110> that<00:06:28.529> sometime

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.379 
little running video that sometime

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.570 
little running video that sometime
everything<00:06:31.379> else<00:06:31.560> seems<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:31.949> be<00:06:32.069> working<00:06:32.159> well

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
everything else seems to be working well

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.850 
everything else seems to be working well
I've<00:06:32.819> trashed<00:06:33.150> I've<00:06:33.659> jumped<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.169> truck<00:06:34.409> real

I've trashed I've jumped the truck real
high<00:06:35.039> of<00:06:35.400> rolled<00:06:36.300> it<00:06:36.509> crashed<00:06:36.839> it<00:06:37.080> beat<00:06:37.319> up<00:06:37.469> on

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
high of rolled it crashed it beat up on

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.990 
high of rolled it crashed it beat up on
it<00:06:37.740> on<00:06:37.830> the<00:06:37.919> tire<00:06:38.159> I'm<00:06:38.339> sorry<00:06:38.610> to<00:06:38.729> get<00:06:38.849> any

it on the tire I'm sorry to get any

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.120 
it on the tire I'm sorry to get any
videos<00:06:39.300> of<00:06:39.419> that<00:06:39.539> because<00:06:40.469> I<00:06:40.800> was<00:06:40.979> just

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
videos of that because I was just

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.129 
videos of that because I was just
testing<00:06:41.430> it<00:06:41.759> to<00:06:41.789> see<00:06:41.940> how<00:06:42.270> it's<00:06:42.509> gonna<00:06:42.599> work

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
testing it to see how it's gonna work

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:45.629 
testing it to see how it's gonna work
I<00:06:44.169> didn't<00:06:44.740> want<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.949> jump<00:06:45.129> it<00:06:45.309> and<00:06:45.339> then<00:06:45.490> come

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
I didn't want to jump it and then come

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.040 
I didn't want to jump it and then come
back<00:06:45.669> in<00:06:45.879> the<00:06:45.939> house<00:06:46.089> and<00:06:46.119> have<00:06:46.360> to<00:06:46.449> adjust<00:06:46.749> the

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
back in the house and have to adjust the

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.779 
back in the house and have to adjust the
steering<00:06:47.349> trim<00:06:47.770> I<00:06:47.949> didn't<00:06:48.189> have<00:06:48.309> to<00:06:48.399> jump<00:06:48.610> it

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
steering trim I didn't have to jump it

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.869 
steering trim I didn't have to jump it
and<00:06:48.819> then<00:06:49.889> adjust<00:06:50.889> this<00:06:51.069> of<00:06:51.279> that<00:06:51.460> that's<00:06:51.729> not

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:51.879 
and then adjust this of that that's not

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.639 
and then adjust this of that that's not
quite<00:06:52.119> in<00:06:52.689> tune<00:06:53.229> yet<00:06:53.759> so<00:06:54.759> I<00:06:55.229> just<00:06:56.229> wanted<00:06:56.499> to

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:56.649 
quite in tune yet so I just wanted to

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:02.879 
quite in tune yet so I just wanted to
wait<00:06:56.889> and<00:06:58.619> get<00:06:59.619> the<00:06:59.830> bugs<00:07:00.009> worked<00:07:00.369> out<00:07:00.580> of<00:07:00.759> it
