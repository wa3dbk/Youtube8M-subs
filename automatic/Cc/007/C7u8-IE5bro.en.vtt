00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.199
 all this in our ranks there are many turns it is not uncommon to 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.609
 find more than a hundred 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.710
 they are all different from each other 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.860
 so it's very important to know how to negotiate 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.090
 the passage of turns is broken down into three parts 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.560
 first of all the braking the body position will be that moment two ends 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.100
 feet firmly resting on the footrests elbows but I have in me 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.110
 rejected 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.360
 and we will try to distribute the braking according to the row rank 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.579
 that is, if the terrain is slippery 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.790
 you hit a bit less of the front brake to avoid slipping 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.670
 if the ground is dry on the other hand we will be able to afford 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.020
 to slow down the machine 75% on the front brake and 25% on the brake 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440
 back 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.850
 then when you release the brakes 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.730
 laughs it's too much ahead on the stage 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.320
 at that moment the charente-maritime is used as a pendulum 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.829
 balancing to not be 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.280
 after 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.700
 the leg she remained on the bike will now support mention the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.170
 outdoor footrest 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 so that we have the maximum audience 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.180
 the agent to the inhabitants of 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.450
 put it back as soon as possible on the euro pospisil by pressing hard 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.240
 above 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.320
 to have maximum traction until the curve exit 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.780
 we are face 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.110
 a slope and in addition the peculiarity is that it is 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.650
 slightly downhill 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.880
 so here we will have to exploit the maximum of the width of the track 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.720
 that is to say that you will introduce yourself 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.070
 braking parties outside the bend not say 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.290
 against the streamers you go then he joins from inside the bend 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.739
 good positioning at that time so on the machine 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.759
 this plate around but by September 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.439
 piketty marks the inside of the bend 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.039
 we are steel you go 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.389
 the left leg 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.179
 to balance 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.689
 and well pressed on the right leg 3 to see the maximum of motricity 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.219
 then we come to the part - take and accelerate 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.039
 so there is always a bit of slope 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.479
 so it will have to speed up gradually because if you 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.029
 suddenly accelerate the bike will stall you will go in a 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.639
 great list to fathers of time 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.459
 this is where you will have to start a very reacceleration 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.999
 yesterday 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.999
 until the next turn and then chained 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.219
 in front of a slight curve 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 so here you will introduce yourself while standing on the bike 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:01.919
 at the location 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.069
 the passage com you will stay standing but especially be present on 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.619
 press on the legs 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.409
 you can even at times 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.480
 slow down slightly and appreciate the stabilization of the machine 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.480
 prevent them from going into an ambush 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:29.850
 happiness 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.429
 a big curve 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.429
 it will be interesting to use the full width of this track and to have 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:35.059
 a 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.059
 a trajectory rather flow 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.119
 the position of the feet and the body will be 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.419
 the same as for a traditional print 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.019
 it will be very important especially at the exit of the turn of these cards is 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:49.939
 slightly 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.819
 to be able and accelerate present just overtake them along the stake 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.029
 by going rock you know that the choice the trajectory 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.499
 it's very important if you want to have a good time 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.320
 right here 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.089
 we have a very wide track 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.849
 so the possibility to move to several places 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.669
 in this particular case times spent outside the bend 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.200
 and at a certain moment 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.620
 to see the reds under the banner to tap the full width of the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.620
 track 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.719
 royal sauce takes three parts 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.939
 firstly the president 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:33.809
 this request will be war posted in support 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.090
 the call of the jump 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.200
 at that moment you put a good shot of gas to balance the machine 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.469
 the second part is going to be the moment 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:46.719
 you are in the air 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.659
 thanks to the body you will try to rebalance the machine not to 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.069
 that she country from the front 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.189
 the 3rd part will be the reception 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.330
 where there you will use your legs as a damper for good 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
 you receive smoothly 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.930
 now we are facing the same sources this time downhill 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.020
 the technique is almost the same 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.680
 the momentum standing on postulate we put a gas in the moment of jump 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.080
 the raven to serve to rebalance the machine how the reception is 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.300
 people who will serve as a shock absorber 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.250
 a little thing more we will put a little joke at the time of the 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.250
 reception to leave faster 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.680
 and that's how it would be 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.550
 I hope that with this task you will enjoy even more 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.939
 full kite wounds during long months that fed up 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.939
 just to the letter the advice and especially respect the nature 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.270
 we will introduce you in action the wr 400 m 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.270
 and he from the hexagon 400 m 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.860
 you will also discover the all-terrain range 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.129
 with three novelties 98
