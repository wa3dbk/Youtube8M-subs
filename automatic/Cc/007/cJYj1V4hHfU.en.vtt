 accordingly we offer the best price and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.059
 northeast for our customers in this 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.230
 video review I will tell you how to choose 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.930
 shelves for 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.809
 us walk what they are and what 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.090
 draw your attention posts close to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.909
 dreams walk must contain 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.400
 how do you like this standard skin on a crouton 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.229
 only such beams are represented in our 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.300
 the store 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.900
 aluminum and other metals and materials 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.880
 disc 11 do not fit such sticks 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.100
 much cheaper as they can and with 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.220
 gladly sold the careless 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.590
 what is a card this material which 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.920
 make a tick super light elastic and 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.140
 durable is very important characteristics 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.600
 why you need to cut the floor technique 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.299
 walking implies that you train 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.759
 due to the work of their own weight, they are 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.770
 that dragging without a stick so the bolt 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.930
 should be super and head not to 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.780
 hold down your movements do not create 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.759
 load on joints due to flexibility and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.869
 elasticity appears extra 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.720
 training effect 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.539
 folders push you forward increased 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.899
 load and very importantly dampens 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.090
 vibration and protects your joints 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.979
 strength is needed because in the process on 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.740
 stick carries up to forty percent 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.549
 without these beams just rain 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.580
 lay like carbon fiber 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.130
 woven into glass fiber sticks 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.890
 may contain from 10 to 100 percent 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.470
 carbon fiber more carbon content 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.900
 the stick is even easier agile and 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.209
 elastic such sticks will give more 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.569
 training effect and make walking 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.310
 even more comfortable and interesting shelf 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.470
 there are fixed lengths that is 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.470
 matched to your height or 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.769
 telescopic sliding in two or three 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.769
 addition 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.140
 got 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.160
 the most durable vodka reliably 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.920
 telescopic sticks from famous and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.800
 expensive manufacturers are no longer inferior and 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.960
 reliability and fixed length shelves 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.730
 but it is worth considering that if you buy 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.400
 fixed jar 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.230
 for example, often percentage carbon 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
 to telescopic sticks were 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.600
 similar in ease of durability they 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.470
 must contain already twice as much 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.510
 cotton ie 20 percent and so on 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.090
 if mobility is important for you take 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 telescopic memory if you must 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.430
 maximum characteristics ease and 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.810
 flexibility and reliability buy folders 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.310
 fix how to choose the length a little 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.710
 Use the length of the selection table 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.080
 and the producers stick it is on our 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.140
 site or multiply it adult 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.170
 the 68th pro center extend to bigger 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.900
 value visually pick up the crowd 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.270
 just take u by the handle no matter in 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.190
 what shoes 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.910
 the main of the roller coaster should be 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.150
 right angle 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.140
 arm look right or slightly fox but was 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.430
 not sharp hand does not look up 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.590
 correct shelves for skin csk walk 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.959
 have lanyard or glove 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.650
 a kind of trap system which is reliable 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.450
 covers the brush and protects the hinge joints 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.560
 like on the ski shelves of course for 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.890
 nordic walking 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.600
 Do not fit lanyard . maybe on 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.550
 simple models of one universal 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.430
 size suitable for all sizes 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.300
 on more expensive models the thong has 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.480
 sizes from s to fit 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.870
 grandmother and I think that dad is taller 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.120
 the dimensions of the human would be more sword knots 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.880
 adjusting approximation removal 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.040
 lanyard from the handle and fixed on a stick 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.130
 there is also an advanced system 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.290
 quick disconnect when lanyard can 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.260
 detach from the stick by clicking on the handle 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.280
 the button of such a system is equipped with shelves 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.430
 high level 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.980
 This system is convenient because you can 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.560
 quickly come unfastened from the stick when you 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.800
 need to drink answer the call or 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.500
 other different cases I want to mention 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.620
 that this system cannot be reliable 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.180
 on the shelf is cheaper than 3000 rubles and 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.330
 performance will not be of high quality and long 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.760
 will not serve for example the seller of the silent 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.430
 that in the Russian reality on prayer or 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.980
 the roast grip power cracks and does not 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.460
 fixed on the handles of the handle on the shelves 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.940
 can be rubberized and cork 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.420
 with a long handle and durable and possible 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.060
 wet 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.310
 it does not absorb sweat and moisture also 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.310
 There are rubberized handles on color 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.530
 cork they are made of special 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.600
 Kuchuka have a ribbed surface that 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.030
 give the full feeling of cork handles 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.370
 they are hygienic and do not absorb sweat and 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.190
 it is convenient to use their moisture in winter 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.820
 time such pens are put on everything 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.920
 advanced and sporty sticks 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.740
 cork handle and and nice to hold in 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.650
 hand and using winter but cork 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.540
 absorbs moisture and a couple of years can 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.810
 crumble leading manufacturers 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.240
 make pens with lacquer coating 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.030
 so they serve longer and less 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.230
 susceptible to moisture 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.660
 Nordic walking poles 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.240
 complete with tips for solid 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.220
 and soft surfaces on the stick fixed 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.070
 sharp metal tip for 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.010
 walking on soft ground with snow and sand 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.870
 he is made of his alloy will win what 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.900
 allows you to walk with him even on asphalt 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.700
 for example in winter time on top of the iron 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.580
 rubber tip worn 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.039
 asphalt tip and firmly 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.319
 surface case when you go from 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.689
 asphalt on the ground you shoot rubber 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.120
 tip and keep walking iron 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.819
 there is also a universal 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.159
 the tip from the company excel he put 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.199
 on all advanced stick models and comfortable 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.560
 so that you can change the type 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:40.090
 tip in one simple motion 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.430
 advanced shelves are completed system 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.009
 quick replacements and allow quick 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.460
 replace the old tip with a new one 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.349
 resorting to the services of a service workshop 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.419
 It is worth considering that the iron tip on 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.259
 simple models in case of erasing 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.150
 can only be replaced in the workshop 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:59.620
 now on the wave of popularity 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.849
 Scandinavian walking has opened a lot 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.150
 online stores 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.340
 I will give the devil what the hell for 700 1000 2000 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.159
 rubles under the guise of the floor to our relatives 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.940
 origami buy a couple are you famous here 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:12.009
 manufacturer 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.389
 only they have the technology and experience 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.060
 allowing to do really 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.229
 do not buy quality ladle 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.779
 cheap analogues 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.180
 then avoid surprises be allergic 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.620
 lanyard parade and glove or 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.199
 broken beam in a month 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.629
 use lack of spare parts 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:30.699
 in the manufacturer's warranty store and not
