00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:42.420
 good morning we put then we have the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.420
 calm this world an hour later 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.120
 we accompany you to do the third I decided 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.879
 I didn't want to make the little heart here 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 take you with me in this is good for the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.399
 and I'll tell you later after I did it is 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.879
 not bad at all as it came hope or type 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.509
 the fear that if verons come well 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.390
 will come beautiful low crosses and have me 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.649
 removed the same phone and not because of me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.600
 you said to take them off but 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.090
 simply because they were knotted and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's hot because it's hot if not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.509
 I would have continued to keep why 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.009
 however I liked them and I was proud 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.800
 hayden who was poor and calm but nothing 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:34.500
 now I'll look a little and then we'll see 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:37.649
 what will happen in life hello you were 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.799
 and police perfect number ten minutes 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:47.000
 so let's start my look a bit 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.000
 evening to witness blood 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 no no and no two girls 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.310
 in the queue everything remains good 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.910
 this year 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 now it is lost we see while life 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 here 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.410
 such as 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.049
 periods as painful furniture 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.590
 there 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.170
 then we practically have 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.470
 here we are, now and then 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.520
 from my strength you could see that 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.530
 Oh God, nice region, but it doesn't 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.470
 not even so badly as to say mine 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.130
 uncle I die unfortunate principles and draw 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.990
 ideas then on the bone was a bit kind 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.790
 that I was there that said loot enough 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.340
 just stop please talk stop 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.430
 but then everything went well now apple 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.260
 bandaged invited this question to 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.050
 part because I like the outside since 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.540
 when your at the touch 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.960
 since when memory apart for that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.920
 let's say that apart from that there will also be the 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.450
 my name in the first place and then we say that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.330
 it represents my little heart a little 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.650
 to magician in the car and represents a 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.510
 little my emotional heart and let's say 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.700
 that not seen the announcement no name not 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.770
 all the people there are written 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.310
 love you can enter as they can 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.090
 get out a generic love suitable if in the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.340
 meaning who can enter if it goes wrong if it is 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.260
 does and there is no problem why not 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.290
 there is no constraint let's put it this way 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.550
 I know that maybe so many say that though for 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.450
 me still has a meaning that I a 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.390
 forming this is important thing 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.190
 means to you and I could do it 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.300
 simoni 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.590
 since everyone was there for me 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.130
 it means something more important than 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.520
 my son I do not care and then 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.580
 anything 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.100
 someone's enough to papello 's 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.880
 get a musso mind if I ever do 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.050
 others however boh 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.320
 still very close now I go to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.350
 take a healing tour and then we'll see you 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.240
 when the world will end when will the 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.240
