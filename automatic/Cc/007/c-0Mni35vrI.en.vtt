normally take I did a little side road
and<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.750> could<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.020> swore<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:12.010> was<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.190> circle

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and I could have swore it was a circle

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.000 
and I could have swore it was a circle
but<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.200> tell<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.530> isn't<00:03:17.740> fern

right<00:04:28.270> now<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.770> feel<00:04:33.400> like<00:04:33.550> I'm<00:04:33.669> tired<00:04:33.880> but

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
right now and I feel like I'm tired but

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.620 
right now and I feel like I'm tired but
I'm<00:04:34.240> still<00:04:34.419> thinking<00:04:35.340> man<00:04:36.340> what<00:04:37.150> if<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.300> coyote

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
I'm still thinking man what if a coyote

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.960 
I'm still thinking man what if a coyote
came<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:38.020> front<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.230> me<00:04:38.320> right<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:38.880> it's<00:04:39.880> just

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
came in front of me right now it's just

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.830 
came in front of me right now it's just
very<00:04:40.210> real<00:04:40.419> possibility

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
very real possibility

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.710 
very real possibility
you<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.950> coyotes<00:04:43.130> around<00:04:43.610> here<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.090> deer

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
you have coyotes around here and deer

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.110 
you have coyotes around here and deer
and<00:04:45.070> black<00:04:46.070> bear<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.550> things<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.060> nature

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and black bear and things of that nature

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.190 
and black bear and things of that nature
so<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.950> possibilities<00:04:49.610> there<00:04:50.710> but<00:04:51.710> uh<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:53.200> feel

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
so the possibilities there but uh I feel

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.390 
so the possibilities there but uh I feel
like<00:04:54.230> I'm<00:04:54.440> strong<00:04:54.650> enough<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.980> could<00:04:55.160> take<00:04:55.370> it

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
like I'm strong enough I could take it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.510 
like I'm strong enough I could take it
like<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.570> if<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.590> have<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:57.830> kind<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.280> strength

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
like and if I have that kind of strength

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.670 
like and if I have that kind of strength
and<00:04:58.760> reserve<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.389> should<00:05:00.260> be<00:05:00.380> able<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.560> keep

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and reserve I should be able to keep

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.389 
and reserve I should be able to keep
going<00:05:00.889> that's<00:05:01.760> my<00:05:02.120> theory
