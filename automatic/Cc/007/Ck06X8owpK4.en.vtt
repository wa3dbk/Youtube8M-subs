00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.150
 the blue and white little by little is taking 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:06.430
 way to the commitment of this 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.420
 next Friday against the selection of 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.669

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.889
 three of the four legionaries who are 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.079
 summoned are already training with 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.849
 normality with the select and seek 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.560
 stay with a position in the eleven 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.000
 headline 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.020
 the select already trains with 27 players 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 preparing matches for the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.820
 World Cup qualifier against guyana 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.090
 this morning they trained normally 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.239
 the legionaries steve purdy lester 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.900
 white and rafael burgos he had a long 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.920
 trip to get to el salvador if it was 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.850
 All day trip because this one was 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.800
 like 20 hours for the flight for all 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.360
 the waits that we have had also in 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.760
 airports the colleagues that have 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.699
 been working since they have a week 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.489
 two weeks is not working is seen 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.140
 difficult the situation but it comes with 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.489
 the mindset of doing things well 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.189
 they have with the mentality of winning a 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.799
 position and first time they are punctual to 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:08.110
 7 o'clock in the morning the players of the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.240
 select came to the court and then 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 of the prayer began to jog 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.090
 around the court to warm up and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.250
 they stopped for a few minutes to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.410
 perform stretching exercises 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.800
 so we need to concentrate on the 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.480
 details of the game and I think if 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.970
 we consulted in those things the two 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.040
 victories are going to come so we go well if 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.710
 we play our game really here in 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.530
 he looks for systems where the fans 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.860
 we are going to have everything there is something sad 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.290
 with driver may I be able 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.430
 recover very fast but more and so 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.190
 we need to move on and so he and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.810
 I had little experience with 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.119
 all against guatemala and when we go to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 see what happens and the dynamics of 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.460
 training today again did the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.950
 work in tight spaces always 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 taking care of the ball transfer 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.050
 Game changes and pressure marking 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.619
 when you do not have the ball to not 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.650
 let him think the rival 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.810
 the truth that I'm happy enough to be 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.110
 there nice one selection and a few days 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.230
 of the game I feel completely good 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.909
 a little tired normal but already for the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 I train already in the afternoon and I think I'm going to 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.150
 be better and expect to fight by train or 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.840
 by train or show that I want to play and 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.879
 then also to quickly attach to what 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.760
 what what he wants what 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.069
 you already need what it is that in each envelope 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.049
 the series between costa rica and mexico 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.209
 those selected expect that the 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.049
 results of their matches them 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.810
 favor 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.629
 but before they think about winning the next 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.180
 six points to define the pass to the 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.569
 hexagonal against costa rica on 12 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.549
