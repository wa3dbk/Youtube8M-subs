it<00:01:05.439> just<00:01:05.590> creates<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.040> web<00:01:06.219> view<00:01:06.430> called<00:01:07.299> google

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
it just creates a web view called google

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.440 
it just creates a web view called google
and<00:01:07.899> we'll<00:01:08.430> assign<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.640> web<00:01:09.880> view<00:01:10.149> in<00:01:10.329> our

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
and we'll assign that web view in our

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.109 
and we'll assign that web view in our
interface<00:01:10.810> later<00:01:11.610> alright<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:12.820> now<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:13.060> we

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
interface later alright so now that we

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.300 
interface later alright so now that we
have<00:01:13.149> those<00:01:13.329> outlet<00:01:13.780> with<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.020> web<00:01:14.259> view<00:01:14.469> we

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
have those outlet with a web view we

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.840 
have those outlet with a web view we
need<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:16.829> automatically<00:01:17.829> create<00:01:18.189> some

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
need to automatically create some

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.819 
need to automatically create some
getters<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.329> setters<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.469> it's<00:01:20.649> got<00:01:20.799> a

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
getters and setters so it's got a

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.929 
getters and setters so it's got a
property<00:01:21.399> non-atomic<00:01:23.189> retain<00:01:25.289> uiwebview<00:01:26.289> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
property non-atomic retain uiwebview and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.160 
property non-atomic retain uiwebview and
google<00:01:29.700> alright<00:01:30.700> that's<00:01:31.000> really<00:01:31.509> only<00:01:31.750> need

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
google alright that's really only need

google alright that's really only need
to<00:01:32.920> show<00:01:33.609> google<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.180> web<00:01:34.329> view<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.619> in<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
to show google and web view but in the

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.160 
to show google and web view but in the
next<00:01:37.030> tutorial<00:01:37.149> I'm<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.659> to<00:01:37.810> show<00:01:37.869> how<00:01:38.140> you

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
next tutorial I'm going to show how you

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.340 
next tutorial I'm going to show how you
can<00:01:38.320> implement<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:39.299> utility<00:01:40.299> called<00:01:40.600> share<00:01:41.109> kit

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
can implement a utility called share kit

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.249 
can implement a utility called share kit
and<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:42.670> does<00:01:42.759> is<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.659> very<00:01:43.929> easy

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
and what it does is it's very easy

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.859 
and what it does is it's very easy
sharing<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.670> can<00:01:45.850> share<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.299> page<00:01:46.570> within

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
sharing you can share the page within

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.469 
sharing you can share the page within
the<00:01:47.049> web<00:01:47.170> view<00:01:47.439> like<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.670> it's<00:01:49.030> pretty

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
the web view like that and it's pretty

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.450 
the web view like that and it's pretty
much<00:01:49.600> all<00:01:49.810> done<00:01:49.990> for<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.619> has<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> import<00:01:51.429> a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
much all done for you you has a import a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.760 
much all done for you you has a import a
few<00:01:51.609> things<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.109> that's<00:01:53.109> that's<00:01:53.350> besides<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
few things and that's that's besides the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.660 
few things and that's that's besides the
point<00:01:53.829> i'll<00:01:54.070> show<00:01:54.189> you<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.369> next<00:01:54.549> tutorial

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
point i'll show you the next tutorial

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.749 
point i'll show you the next tutorial
but<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:55.240> can<00:01:55.359> go<00:01:55.509> ahead<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.659> set<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:55.899> up<00:01:56.020> now

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
but we can go ahead and set that up now

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.200 
but we can go ahead and set that up now
and<00:01:57.759> create<00:01:58.359> an<00:01:58.509> ib<00:01:58.990> action<00:02:00.990> called<00:02:01.990> share<00:02:02.350> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and create an ib action called share and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.449 
and create an ib action called share and
ID<00:02:04.530> whoa<00:02:05.850> sender<00:02:06.850> alright<00:02:07.739> so<00:02:08.739> there<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
ID whoa sender alright so there is the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.270 
ID whoa sender alright so there is the
interface<00:02:09.789> file<00:02:10.269> ladies<00:02:10.659> and<00:02:10.959> gentlemen

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
interface file ladies and gentlemen

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.550 
interface file ladies and gentlemen
go<00:02:13.940> ahead<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.150> come<00:02:14.420> back<00:02:14.569> here<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.080> select

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
go ahead and come back here and select

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.270 
go ahead and come back here and select
your<00:02:15.680> view<00:02:16.220> controller<00:02:16.700> dot<00:02:17.030> m<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:18.280> let's

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
your view controller dot m and let's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.520 
your view controller dot m and let's
synthase<00:02:20.470> let's<00:02:21.470> synthesize<00:02:23.140> google<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
synthase let's synthesize google and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.900 
synthase let's synthesize google and
that's<00:02:27.530> synthesizing<00:02:28.250> our<00:02:28.400> web<00:02:28.550> view<00:02:28.760> which

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
that's synthesizing our web view which

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.280 
that's synthesizing our web view which
automatically<00:02:29.540> creates<00:02:29.930> getters<00:02:30.260> and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
automatically creates getters and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.170 
automatically creates getters and
setters<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:32.380> what<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:33.560> will<00:02:33.800> do<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.400> mean<00:02:35.060> it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
setters and what we will do I mean it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
setters and what we will do I mean it's
not<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.360> best<00:02:35.540> way<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.750> do<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.080> by<00:02:36.680> any<00:02:36.980> means

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
not the best way to do it by any means

that<00:05:57.400> we<00:05:58.400> will<00:05:58.610> implement<00:05:58.850> in<00:05:59.240> another

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
that we will implement in another

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.629 
that we will implement in another
tutorial<00:06:00.139> but<00:06:00.710> go<00:06:00.980> ahead<00:06:01.010> and<00:06:01.220> connect<00:06:01.490> that

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
tutorial but go ahead and connect that

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.750 
tutorial but go ahead and connect that
to<00:06:01.669> that<00:06:01.910> and<00:06:02.260> then<00:06:03.260> connect<00:06:03.650> google<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.639> our

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
to that and then connect google to our

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.700 
to that and then connect google to our
web<00:06:04.880> view<00:06:05.060> because<00:06:05.240> google<00:06:05.750> was<00:06:05.930> declared<00:06:06.590> as
