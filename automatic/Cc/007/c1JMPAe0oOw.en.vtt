 thank you very much today I bring you 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.070
 a cooking video because I know that you 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.130
 they like cooking videos and I 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.829
 like to cook and eat so what is the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.649
 problem if you like my channel you can 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.570
 subscribe and if not also maybe some 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.040
 any day you like the 7 while the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.630
 You can share it with your friends 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.670
 You can comment on how you arrived 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.129
 here and you can also comment what you 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.320
 it seemed like you want to see things like that 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.059
 then I leave you with the video they are just 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.199
 four simple ingredients that 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.589
 I found in the market and it remains very 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:59.190
 delicious so I have a kiss a 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.190
 hug and we'll see each other in the next video 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 let's use chocolate no matter 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.670
 from which chocolate I used sparks 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.570
 of chocolate but the truth is that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 it matters because then we're going to melt it 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 we need bread I bought these breads 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.909
 but you can still make your own country and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.829
 what is the ease of having the oven 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.109
 excuse me if you hear me delete the 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.970
 truth is that I have a scream and therefore no 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.190
 they have to continue anyway 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.960
 we will occupy being those is important that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.120
 do these still preserve the pretty and 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.480
 that you are not eating I know that you 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.790
 They like it but you do not eat them 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.650
 and finally we will use cream this 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 cream is not so normal box but that 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.970
 it comes in what is a little boat and the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.080
 difference of this and that is that this 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.080
 It is thicker 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 if I had the doubt of an ingredient 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.009
 I'll leave the list in face for your 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.640
 brands to give you 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.640
 find them 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.140
 we are going to deposit all those little pancakes 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.620
 or all our bread in a bowl and we 're going 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 to do 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.790
 absolutely everything we are going to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.790
 make product with our hands 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.450
 since we have all done polvito let's go 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.859
 to start adding cream I add 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.859
 more or less 250 grams 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.670
 Y 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.610
 all right 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.020
 and we are going to form a variable mix that 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.020
 we stay in the crimes 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.760
 since we have the mixture prepared what 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.760
 what are we going to start doing are balls 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.750
 already having the balls we are going to 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.580
 put the refrigerator in 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.930
 this is for the little ball to put on a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.850
 bit harder and we can do what 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.310
 next let's make a roll in 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.020
 and that's where we're going to place 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.030
 our cherries that's why it's important 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.710
 to undo that has a stick but if not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.740
 you want you can just like it's a strawberry 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.720
 a grape or any fruit that stings 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.720
 pause not a clear watermelon not 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.300
 and we were approaching absolutely 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.300
 all our balls 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.360
 let's melt the chocolate or benny 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.980
 Maria in the microwave by and we're going to 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.210
 give it to our little balls 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.810
 yes 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.810
 all right 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.820
 at the beginning and I had something like that super 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.190
 thick and I had to put it in the refrigerator and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.290
 take it out to continue with the next 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.670
 half of the ball but I recommend you 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.770
 that you can put milk because after 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.780
 I put milk in chocolate 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.840
 this was much easier but now 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.340
 they were in the last balls but 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.410
 it depends on how you chocolate you 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.420
 put him on because you decide 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.740
 in the way you see it after 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.720
 this procedure will pass to 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.580
 refrigerator or freezer from one to two 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.130
 hours waiting for a lot more 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.960
 hard then to present I put it in 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.000
 those things where they put the cupcakes I think 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.150
 they are called capable and llos 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.860
 and once we take a bite it's gone 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.810
 to see like that or that there are more matches now 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.700
 if he is not falling because he has not yet 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.980
 I was ready to open it but this is 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.420
 the point of how it should be seen by me 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.860
 part I liked very much thank you very much for 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.810
