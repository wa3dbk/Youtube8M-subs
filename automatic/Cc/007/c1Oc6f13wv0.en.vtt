00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of evidently the guy who in that book

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
of evidently the guy who in that book
who<00:00:37.230> said<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:37.710> did<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.370> everyone

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
who said when he did it first everyone

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
who said when he did it first everyone
to<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.329> sick<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> say

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
to get like really sick what do you say

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
to get like really sick what do you say
yeah<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.920> people<00:00:40.950> mentioned<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
yeah some people mentioned that when

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.580 
yeah some people mentioned that when
they<00:00:42.210> first<00:00:42.480> start<00:00:42.780> eating<00:00:42.989> raw<00:00:43.110> eggs<00:00:43.290> since

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
they first start eating raw eggs since

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
they first start eating raw eggs since
it<00:00:43.710> has<00:00:43.829> certain<00:00:44.070> cleansing<00:00:44.460> properties<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it has certain cleansing properties I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
it has certain cleansing properties I
think<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> might<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.079> um<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.129> depends<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
think it might be um it depends on the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.549 
think it might be um it depends on the
person's<00:00:47.910> body<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> think<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
person's body for one but I think it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
person's body for one but I think it
might<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.950> directly<00:00:50.579> correlated<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> how

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
might be directly correlated to how

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
might be directly correlated to how
crappily<00:00:51.840> you're<00:00:52.020> eating<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.800> if

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
crappily you're eating now so I think if

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
crappily you're eating now so I think if
you<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.550> crappy<00:00:53.940> diet<00:00:54.149> then

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you have like a really crappy diet then

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.240 
you have like a really crappy diet then
the<00:00:55.110> eggs<00:00:55.260> might<00:00:55.440> clear<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> little

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the eggs might clear you out a little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
the eggs might clear you out a little
bit<00:00:56.430> by<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> time<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.329> started<00:00:57.390> eating<00:00:57.960> raw

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
bit by the time we started eating raw

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
bit by the time we started eating raw
eggs<00:00:58.289> who<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.649> already<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> healthy<00:00:59.789> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
eggs who are already kind of healthy I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
eggs who are already kind of healthy I
don't<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.109> much<00:01:01.230> work<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> do

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
don't think it had so much work to do

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.590 
don't think it had so much work to do
but<00:01:02.280> um<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> didn't<00:01:03.059> experience<00:01:03.270> any

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

stomach pains or any diary or anything

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.980 
stomach pains or any diary or anything
like<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.600> people<00:01:06.869> might

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
like that but some people might

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920 
like that but some people might
