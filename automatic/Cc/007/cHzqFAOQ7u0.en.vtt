what I recommend doing is progressing

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.640 
what I recommend doing is progressing
through<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.509> game<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:16.020> little<00:00:16.170> bit<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.560> order

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
through the game a little bit in order

through the game a little bit in order
to<00:00:16.890> unlock<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> safe<00:00:17.550> house<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.760> I'm<00:00:18.000> about

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
to show you on the map in my current

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
to show you on the map in my current
location<00:00:20.640> there's<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.150> safehouse<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
location there's a safehouse it's a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.200 
location there's a safehouse it's a
radio<00:00:22.170> tower<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.740> order<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> use<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> bed<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
radio tower in order to use the bed you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.519 
radio tower in order to use the bed you
will<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> climb<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.109> ladder<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
will have to climb up the ladder to the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
will have to climb up the ladder to the
second<00:00:26.189> or<00:00:26.310> third<00:00:26.340> storey<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.269> tower<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
second or third storey of the tower and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
second or third storey of the tower and
actually<00:00:28.529> using<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> bed<00:00:29.039> will<00:00:29.250> faster<00:00:29.580> over

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
actually using the bed will faster over

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700 
actually using the bed will faster over
time<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.330> nighttime<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
time if it's nighttime and you use the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.319 
time if it's nighttime and you use the
bed<00:00:31.859> it'll<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.309> daytime<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.210> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
bed it'll be daytime but if you do it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
bed it'll be daytime but if you do it
during<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> daytime<00:00:33.750> it'll<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.680> faster

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
during the daytime it'll actually faster

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
during the daytime it'll actually faster
over<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> nighttime<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> reason<00:00:36.600> we're

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
over to nighttime now the reason we're

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
over to nighttime now the reason we're
doing<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> closest

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
doing this is because it is the closest

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.590 
doing this is because it is the closest
safe<00:00:38.579> house<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> bridge<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.450> I've

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
safe house to the bridge which I've

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.990 
safe house to the bridge which I've
marked<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.140> map<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.790> right

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
marked on my map and I you can see right

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.430 
marked on my map and I you can see right
there<00:00:42.300> even<00:00:42.570> though<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:42.899> bit<00:00:43.170> dark

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
there even though it's a little bit dark

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
there even though it's a little bit dark
I<00:00:43.950> recommend<00:00:44.730> turning<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.210> flashlight

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
I recommend turning on your flashlight

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.920 
I recommend turning on your flashlight
which<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.960> forgot<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> reason

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
which I forgot to do now the reason

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.389 
which I forgot to do now the reason
we're<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.350> using<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> safehouse<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
we're gonna be using the safehouse is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.709 
we're gonna be using the safehouse is
because<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:50.969> close<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> bridge<00:00:51.570> as

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
because it's as close to the bridge as

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
because it's as close to the bridge as
you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.960> possibly<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.500> using<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> safehouse

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you can possibly get using a safehouse

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
you can possibly get using a safehouse
and<00:00:53.579> being<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.449> night<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.750> quite

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and being out at night is quite

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.180 
and being out at night is quite
dangerous<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.829> something<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
dangerous so that's not something you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
dangerous so that's not something you
want<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.550> running<00:00:56.820> across<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> entire<00:00:57.629> map

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
want to do running across the entire map

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.450 
want to do running across the entire map
from<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> home<00:00:58.350> base<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.340> why<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
from the home base so that's why I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.040 
from the home base so that's why I
recommend<00:00:59.850> doing<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.120> from<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.899> now

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
recommend doing it from here so now

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
recommend doing it from here so now
you'll<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> actually<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:03.300> my

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you'll see that I actually do use my

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
you'll see that I actually do use my
flashlight<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.559> recommend<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.100> starting

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
flashlight and I recommend just starting

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
flashlight and I recommend just starting
to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> left<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.970> soon<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> come<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.630> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to the left as soon as you come out of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
to the left as soon as you come out of
that<00:01:07.729> ladder<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that ladder and you're gonna want to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
that ladder and you're gonna want to
stay<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> high<00:01:10.170> ground<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
stay on the high ground because the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
stay on the high ground because the
bridge<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> higher<00:01:12.090> ground<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
bridge is on the higher ground and you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.330 
bridge is on the higher ground and you
want<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.290> sure<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.650> end<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.920> under

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
want to make sure you don't end up under

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.950 
want to make sure you don't end up under
the<00:01:14.369> bridge<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.970> else<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.479> won't<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.930> very

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the bridge or else that won't be very

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.350 
the bridge or else that won't be very
useful<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> am

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
useful for you so as you can see I am

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.670 
useful for you so as you can see I am
getting<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> bridge<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
getting on the bridge right now now the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
getting on the bridge right now now the
bridge<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.920> quite<00:01:20.340> long<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.330> recommend

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bridge is quite long and I recommend

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
bridge is quite long and I recommend
using<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.470> waypoint<00:01:23.220> marker<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:24.030> map

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
