come on I think the cutters made is a
device<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:19.980> originally<00:00:20.580> developed<00:00:20.960> by

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
device that was originally developed by

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.499 
device that was originally developed by
an<00:00:22.140> ingenious<00:00:22.470> fellow<00:00:22.980> who<00:00:23.759> had<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.179> friend

with motion issues she couldn't hold the

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.279 
with motion issues she couldn't hold the
cutter<00:00:27.570> she<00:00:28.289> couldn't<00:00:28.789> work<00:00:29.789> standing<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.630> so

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
cutter she couldn't work standing up so

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
cutter she couldn't work standing up so
he<00:00:32.099> thought<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.910> put<00:00:33.150> his<00:00:33.270> clever<00:00:33.750> brain

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
he thought about it put his clever brain

process just the same way you do when
you're<00:03:09.700> using<00:03:09.910> your<00:03:10.060> cutter<00:03:10.590> starting<00:03:11.590> from

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
you're using your cutter starting from

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.100 
you're using your cutter starting from
the<00:03:11.860> edge<00:03:12.060> I'm<00:03:13.060> gonna<00:03:13.209> align<00:03:13.510> with<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.870> mark

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
the edge I'm gonna align with that mark

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.690 
the edge I'm gonna align with that mark
make<00:03:14.350> sure<00:03:14.500> my<00:03:14.650> screw<00:03:14.950> head<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.220> facing<00:03:15.580> away

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
make sure my screw head is facing away

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.420 
make sure my screw head is facing away
from<00:03:15.820> me<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.660> I'm<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:16.959> gonna<00:03:17.110> follow<00:03:17.530> that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
from me and I'm just gonna follow that

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.940 
from me and I'm just gonna follow that
line<00:03:19.110> right<00:03:20.110> off<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.500> edge<00:03:22.650> make<00:03:23.650> sure<00:03:23.830> I'm

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
line right off the edge make sure I'm

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.039 
line right off the edge make sure I'm
holding<00:03:24.250> my<00:03:24.370> running<00:03:24.820> pliers<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.269> right<00:03:25.420> way

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.460 

instead<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:31.030> cutter<00:03:31.269> mates<00:03:31.720> can<00:03:31.930> also<00:03:32.140> be

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
instead the cutter mates can also be

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.710 
instead the cutter mates can also be
used<00:03:32.709> for<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.040> straight<00:03:33.489> lines<00:03:33.730> I'm<00:03:34.150> gonna

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
used for the straight lines I'm gonna

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.880 
used for the straight lines I'm gonna
add<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:36.030> rule<00:03:37.260> tighten<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.560> there<00:03:38.709> so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
add this rule tighten that in there so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.500 
add this rule tighten that in there so
it<00:03:38.980> stays<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.280> place<00:03:41.970> using<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.209> straight

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
it stays in place using this straight

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.630 
it stays in place using this straight
edge<00:03:43.980> which<00:03:44.980> again<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.310> has<00:03:45.430> these<00:03:45.580> little

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
edge which again it has these little

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.070 
edge which again it has these little
pegs<00:03:46.060> you're<00:03:46.299> just<00:03:46.450> gonna<00:03:46.570> suck<00:03:46.840> them<00:03:46.989> into

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
pegs you're just gonna suck them into

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.949 
pegs you're just gonna suck them into
the<00:03:47.290> grid<00:03:50.370> that's<00:03:51.370> on<00:03:51.579> there<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.780> will

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
the grid that's on there and I will

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.840 
the grid that's on there and I will
slide<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.410> right<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:53.709> here<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.130> would<00:03:54.640> use

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
slide it right in here I would use

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.259 
slide it right in here I would use
holder<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.480> keep<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.840> rule<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.799> place<00:03:57.269> slide

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
holder to keep the rule in place slide

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.630 
holder to keep the rule in place slide
