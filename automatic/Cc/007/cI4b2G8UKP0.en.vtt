00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 It's good to talk here on lm 3 27 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.679
 only it is an adapter the b2 is it botou 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.799
 Ordered at the world extreme I paid I think 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.780
 that $ 15 and basically will read 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 all the mapping all the data that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 that is yours and will provide and through the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.710
 mobile app I'll get it 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 see all this data there interpret them 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.619
 and speed input temperature 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 the various data I've already 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.859
 I'll show you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.960
 Let's take a sequel and post it on 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.020
 subaru wrx 2011 good this location 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.930
 is below the place panel now that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.930
 You see stay here. 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 notice that the red light was 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.360
 indicating that it is already connected and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.140
 is standy by'll get my phone 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:04.070
 turn bluetooth on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.070
 I'll open the application is connecting 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 separating the yellow light is blinking 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.460
 also indicating that it is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.299
 connected in the year I'm doing readings 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 already playing 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.860
 connected via jn real-time bluetooth and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.860
 including rotation can 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.280
 here you have another one in this application 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.650
 Tokyo has had a number of functions can 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.230
 for example have all the codes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.980
 diego only in general gestation send z 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.980
 it takes a little bit 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.259
 good in my case I have nothing is everything 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.429
 right with the good injection I can 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.619
 do 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.880
 I can only make a recording of a video 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.490
 and with the information I want in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.100
 for example the picture already 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 distorted because the setting I 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.520
 I voted here I left I left 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.580
 configured speed is rpm speed 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.379
 and mediate the measurement was actually 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.760
 for air / fuel measurement here 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.830
 but it's not 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.140
 I can trade simply by holding 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.540
 on the screen triggers the I will put 11 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.390
 digital display and here you have a 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.459
 series all that is green or 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.280
 say they are generations who can see 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.980
 you have a lot of information one 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 information series are many 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.769
 the average speed air temperature 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.599
 barometer from the huge range of 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.700
 indicate which person died 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:47.090
 keep on my cell phone 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.560
 there is a lot of information a lot of information 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.720
 estimated distance to finish the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720
 fuel but every 10 km 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.830
 here the temperature for example of the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.680
 radiator temperature 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 there I can hold move and leave here 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.319
 When recording a video, it goes with 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.900
 this information 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.560
 now you have a lot of information here 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.190
 Good, I'm going to leave the video and now I 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.600
 Can I look if the adapter is all 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.430
 I just wanted to indicate here that the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.040
 driver connected to a 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.160
 computer connected and connected , and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.520
 rooney means if he's saying 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.340
 that has no error 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.810
 our information 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.190
 good, this is it, I think the video 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.190
 very basic and demonstrating 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.060
 demonstrate the operation of this torque 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.060
 and that's it
