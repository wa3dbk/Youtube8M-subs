00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
powerful tool there is for building

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
powerful tool there is for building
muscle<00:00:53.039> fast<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.699> workout<00:00:57.120> log<00:00:57.420> book<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
muscle fast it's a workout log book and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.619 
muscle fast it's a workout log book and
a<00:00:58.109> pen<00:00:58.760> yes<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.910> know<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.210> isn't<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> most

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a pen yes I know this isn't the most

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.150 
a pen yes I know this isn't the most
exciting<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> world<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
exciting thing in the world but the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
exciting thing in the world but the
truth<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> matter<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.600> workout

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
truth of the matter is that a workout

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
truth of the matter is that a workout
log<00:01:04.260> book<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> pen<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.000> basic

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
log book and a pen is the basic

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.330 
log book and a pen is the basic
foundation<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.770> entire

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
foundation for which your entire

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
foundation for which your entire
training<00:01:08.820> program<00:01:09.299> should<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.630> based<00:01:09.810> around

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
training program should be based around

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
training program should be based around
the<00:01:10.530> reason<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.790> simple<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the reason for this is simple and that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
the reason for this is simple and that
is<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> ultimate<00:01:13.380> foundation<00:01:14.060> for

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is that the ultimate foundation for

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
is that the ultimate foundation for
building<00:01:15.090> muscle<00:01:15.570> size<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.960> strength<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
building muscle size and strength is

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
building muscle size and strength is
progression<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.540> words<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.140> want

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
progression in other words if you want

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
progression in other words if you want
to<00:01:19.439> consistently<00:01:20.070> build<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.549> muscle<00:01:20.880> mass

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to consistently build your muscle mass

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
to consistently build your muscle mass
to<00:01:21.210> greater<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> greater<00:01:21.840> levels<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.740> every

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to greater and greater levels then every

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
to greater and greater levels then every
single<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.729> enter<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> gym<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.810> need

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
single time you enter the gym you need

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780 
single time you enter the gym you need
to<00:01:25.320> present<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.770> muscles<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> new

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to present your muscles with a new

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
to present your muscles with a new
growth<00:01:27.210> stimulus<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.350> haven't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
growth stimulus but they haven't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.550 
growth stimulus but they haven't
experienced<00:01:29.549> before<00:01:30.049> every<00:01:31.049> single<00:01:31.320> time<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
experienced before every single time you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
experienced before every single time you
enter<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> gym<00:01:32.220> you're<00:01:32.400> breaking<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.060> your

enter the gym you're breaking down your
muscle<00:01:33.600> tissue<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.320> forcing<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> body

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
muscle tissue and then forcing the body

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.340 
muscle tissue and then forcing the body
to<00:01:35.400> adapt<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> specific<00:01:36.540> level<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to adapt to that specific level of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.319 
to adapt to that specific level of
stress<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> presented<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.640> but

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
stress that you presented it with but

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
stress that you presented it with but
once<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> muscles<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.170> adapted<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.660 
going to grow any bigger or any stronger
until<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> increase<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> workload<00:01:46.670> increase

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
until you increase the workload increase

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.940 
until you increase the workload increase
the<00:01:47.880> stress<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.329> force<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> adapt<00:01:49.619> even

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the stress and force them to adapt even

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.240 
the stress and force them to adapt even
further<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.450> benchpress<00:01:51.780> 180<00:01:52.710> pounds<00:01:53.070> for

further if you benchpress 180 pounds for
six<00:01:53.520> reps<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.909> today's<00:01:54.180> workout<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.960> chest

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
six reps in today's workout your chest

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.380 
six reps in today's workout your chest
is<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.890> adapt<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> specific<00:01:56.790> level
