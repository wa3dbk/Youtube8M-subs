00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.160
 bye boys and girls there are media 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.000
 today we will open a very special arie 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.619
 namely the 3 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.249
 it stands to the end 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.979
 the most active 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.979
 presumably it is about products that are so curious what is in them 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.619
 very big and yoga 3 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.339
 I don't think you work in the toy store site in the Netherlands just like that 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.599
 that's all in June 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.739
 what is that i dared to put bag of candies that is tasty 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 what else is in it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.960
 Twitter is a book loss, and a letter has been put out there 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 all in it 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.910
 then we will certainly see what it is now 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.290
 poverty is a magnet 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.830
 if you have anything from the iron. the cookers provide the emergency services 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.830
 then you can go on the shelf and stay there so flare up so crazy not yet 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.090
 because it's all there 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.090
 review the eo program 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.870
 for the one who gave him tree holiday 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.840
 the stickers that now 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.780
 keychain 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.670
 it may not turn 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.060
 the test is almost coming in 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 that is likes it 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.610
 look what is this what are that day 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.400
 but i now have these stickers up to include this too but we will have one today 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 boring open orange took the fnv is still nice but a little six look around 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 on the market this fall 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.750
 heesch is that chance i have i have my large area 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.900
 if you have robert for the heating then confuse me too 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.660
 not nearly finished 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.620
 mvv view 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.970
 the company just thinks it's becoming too dangerous 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.430
 and vice versa 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.090
 3 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.080
 that's funny 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.350
 the cheerful sounds 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229
 what is nicer 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.359
 farrar so everything that emperor dream you stick 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.829
 to clear a mailman 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.829
 the law may not be broken 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.849
 that's nice 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.489
 that's a good thing 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.559
 because a magnet stage that was previously seen may be a bit 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.729
 and the open market 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.299
 8 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.559
 9 You've made it President 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 it is mandatory 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.259
 just open 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.099
 so 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.180
 that fits 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.679
 it is certainly on the ground 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.679
 I'm in your pajamas too 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.569
 is still on this number 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
 The channel services are from England 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.839
 not possible 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.839
 build in the scoring 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.779
 sixth place after a replay 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 papademos but in the sidewalk when calling 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.909
 who apologize to 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.909
 also received 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.979
 hundreds of thousands of pieces 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
 how many clubs the coast knows 7 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.329
 postage I have no money can be booked 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.329
 9 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.659
 but now his wife would no longer have it 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.659
 contador 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.120
 adv 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.890
 next time we go in a hurry, say goodbye boys and girls 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.929
