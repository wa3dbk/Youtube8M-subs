 Kyrgyz Republic exported from Kyrgyz Osh

 dead and injured 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.390
 Kazakhstani unrest in 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.999
 Kyrgyzstan has not been reported 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.269
 Kyrgyzstan is on the verge of civil 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.809
 of war she inevitably if the fight for the chair 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.769
 the president will not stop and the people 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.879
 do not unite came to this conclusion 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.940
 round table experts kyrgyzstan 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.059
 final solution 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 organized by Kazakhstan 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.649
 political decision making institute 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.760
 together with Kyrgyz 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 political party we are for progress 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.590
 roads and apocalypse 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.520
 forecast of further development of the situation in 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.230
 Kyrgyz give analysts a round 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.030
 the table and who breaks them Riga 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.700
 The decision brought together Russian political scientists 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.760
 Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are the most 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 hard events apparently all 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.230
 still ahead 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.050
 experts are convinced of conflict or 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.270
 must be braised until it exceeds 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.780
 what is the state and for 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 unrest ex president 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.340
 Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiyev 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.520
 these are the main points 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.090
 I am absolutely convinced 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.310
 that it is all organized 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.450
 manageable 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.280
 the pavilions stopped by 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.450
 right flank 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.820
 Bakiyev and his inner circle 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.920
 first son maxim galkin 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 brothers smaller ahmat 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.050
 so on April 7th the family motivation score hundred 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.240
 percent controlled 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.510
 drug traffic passing through 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.550
 territory of Kyrgyzstan opponents they 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.110
 today is a synonym for Dmitry 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.210
 so this is profanation is the enemy of the people 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.720
 Prokofiev patrol subject to be 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.050
 perceived except these people start-up conditions 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.490
 who were deliberately 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160
 self-interest others 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.970
 analysts fear events in Kyrgyzstan 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.120
 will be able to transfer to Kazakhstan 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 the second option is of course very sad 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.620
 in practice closed borders which 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.060
 use immediately after which 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.970
 unfortunately political will on 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.619
 such a step is not yet observed together 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.660
 so that this is all he needs 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.990
 it's good 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.050
 release patch of night 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.040

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.060
 events will take place in Kazakhstan 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.190
 President Nursultan 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.680
 Nazarbayeva wean Bakiyev will not save 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.239
 even the status of the leader of the nation 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 in fact, Almaty stopped 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.319

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.719
 refugee law last week passed 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.340
 massive wave of detention of refugees 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.440

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.170

 Almaty hoping to know anything 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 Something about the fate of the detained husbands 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.369

 Dagestan, according to a lawyer, the authorities have created 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.269
 legal conflict when local laws 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.679
 would put six international

 in the criminal police of the city of Almaty 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.689
 In principle, the authorities do not know yet 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.529

 the situation is really 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.730
