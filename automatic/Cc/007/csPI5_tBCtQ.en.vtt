00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hey it's Paul again and now just uncoil

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.550 
hey it's Paul again and now just uncoil
the<00:00:04.080> rope

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
the rope

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.660 
the rope
now<00:00:04.890> I'm<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.160> show<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.279> how<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
now I'm going to show you how to do the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.369 
now I'm going to show you how to do the
Mountaineers<00:00:06.390> coil<00:00:06.810> it's<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> little<00:00:07.259> bit

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
Mountaineers coil it's a little bit

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.379 
Mountaineers coil it's a little bit
different<00:00:07.620> from<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.010> backpackers<00:00:08.700> well<00:00:08.910> this

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
different from the backpackers well this

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.600 
different from the backpackers well this
is<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.320> don't<00:00:10.620> tend<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.040> prefer<00:00:11.280> as

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
is one that I don't tend to prefer as

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.610 
is one that I don't tend to prefer as
much<00:00:11.849> hang<00:00:12.540> right<00:00:12.750> start<00:00:13.019> by<00:00:13.170> doing<00:00:13.380> is

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
much hang right start by doing is

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.980 
much hang right start by doing is
getting<00:00:14.250> our<00:00:14.460> rope<00:00:14.700> completely<00:00:15.299> stacked<00:00:15.660> out

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
getting our rope completely stacked out

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.230 
getting our rope completely stacked out
on<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> ground<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> get<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.490> throw<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:18.029> end

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
on the ground so I get to throw one end

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660 
on the ground so I get to throw one end
out<00:00:18.449> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.840> far<00:00:19.080> from<00:00:19.109> us<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.650> then<00:00:20.279> we're

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
out kind of far from us and then we're

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.700 
out kind of far from us and then we're
just<00:00:20.699> restocking<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.320> there's<00:00:22.529> no

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
just restocking this so that there's no

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.849 
just restocking this so that there's no
tangles<00:00:23.420> go<00:00:24.420> through<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> whole<00:00:25.019> 200-foot

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
tangles go through the whole 200-foot

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
tangles go through the whole 200-foot
length<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> rope<00:00:29.179> making<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> pile<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
length of the rope making a pile of it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
length of the rope making a pile of it
over<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.130> way<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> coil

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
over here and this way when I go to coil

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.160 
over here and this way when I go to coil
it<00:00:36.739> it'll<00:00:37.739> come<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.430> easily<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it it'll come out really easily and I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.860 
it it'll come out really easily and I
won't<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> fight<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.399> at<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.870> or

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
won't have to fight with it at all or

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
won't have to fight with it at all or
put<00:00:43.079> any<00:00:43.200> force<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> kind<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.430> am

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
put any force on it kind of like I am

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.260 
put any force on it kind of like I am
right<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> pull<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.750> style<00:00:52.610> okay<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
right now and the pull on style okay the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.369 
right now and the pull on style okay the
end<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:55.309> okay<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:57.050> there's<00:00:58.050> some

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
end here okay now there's some

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.520 
end here okay now there's some
advantages<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.270> disadvantages<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:01.140> using

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
advantages and disadvantages for using

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.880 
advantages and disadvantages for using
this<00:01:01.980> method<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.260> Mountaineers<00:01:04.260> coil<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
this method the Mountaineers coil I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.090 
this method the Mountaineers coil I
almost<00:01:05.220> never<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.500> reason<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
almost never use it and the reason is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.730 
almost never use it and the reason is
because<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.360> unlike<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.049> backpackers

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
because this one unlike the backpackers

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.760 
because this one unlike the backpackers
coil<00:01:11.010> does<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.939> fold<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.720> rope<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.320> actually

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
coil does not fold the rope it actually

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.359 
coil does not fold the rope it actually
does<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> coil<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:16.130> now<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.189> goes

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
does put a coil in it now it goes

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.730 
does put a coil in it now it goes
together<00:01:17.580> fine<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> come<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.380> undo

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
together fine when you come and you undo

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560 
together fine when you come and you undo
the<00:01:19.770> rope<00:01:19.979> later<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.909> does<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> little<00:01:21.420> bit

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the rope later it does get a little bit

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.950 
the rope later it does get a little bit
problematic<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.400> first<00:01:24.150> step<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
problematic so first step for this is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
problematic so first step for this is
you're<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> length<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you're going to take a length I like to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.450 
you're going to take a length I like to
do<00:01:27.020> about<00:01:28.340> shoulder<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.579> tip<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.090> arm

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
do about shoulder to the tip of my arm

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
do about shoulder to the tip of my arm
and<00:01:32.460> I'm<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> under<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> pit

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and I'm going to put this under the pit

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
and I'm going to put this under the pit
of<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.710> knee<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> sit<00:01:36.180> indian-style

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
of my knee I'm going to sit indian-style

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.130 
of my knee I'm going to sit indian-style
here<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:39.140> next

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
here and this is out of the way next

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.740 
here and this is out of the way next
thing<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.420> comfortable

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
thing is this is a really comfortable

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
thing is this is a really comfortable
especially<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.619> tired<00:01:43.799> with<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
especially if you're tired with in the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
especially if you're tired with in the
day<00:01:44.490> climbing<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.030> whatever<00:01:45.240> we're<00:01:46.049> just

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
day climbing or whatever we're just

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.130 
day climbing or whatever we're just
going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> start<00:01:46.710> coiling<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.930> our<00:01:48.930> knees

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
going to start coiling around our knees

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
going to start coiling around our knees
sitting<00:01:49.560> indian-style

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.429 

and<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:55.000> just<00:01:55.180> keep<00:01:55.390> rapping<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:58.439> you'll

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
and you just keep rapping and you'll

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.580 
and you just keep rapping and you'll
notice<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.189> really<00:02:00.430> starts<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.970> build<00:02:01.180> up

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
notice that it really starts to build up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.020 
notice that it really starts to build up
into<00:02:02.590> quite<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.890> pile<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:05.229> legs<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:09.670> one's<00:02:09.880> a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
into quite a pile your legs this one's a

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.850 
into quite a pile your legs this one's a
little<00:02:10.209> bit<00:02:10.450> more<00:02:10.479> time-consuming<00:02:11.760> because

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
little bit more time-consuming because

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.920 
little bit more time-consuming because
we're<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:15.010> starting<00:02:15.370> at<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> midpoint<00:02:15.970> in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
we're not starting at the midpoint in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.350 
we're not starting at the midpoint in
working<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.920> double<00:02:18.130> rope<00:02:18.519> length<00:02:18.790> at<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> same

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
working a double rope length at the same

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.600 
working a double rope length at the same
time<00:02:19.630> we're<00:02:20.440> starting<00:02:20.830> at<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.190> end<00:02:21.370> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
time we're starting at one end and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.320 
time we're starting at one end and
coiling<00:02:22.569> all<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.830> way<00:02:24.010> until<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:24.940> get<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.209> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
coiling all the way until we get to the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.030 
coiling all the way until we get to the
other<00:02:25.480> end<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.080> about<00:02:29.380> twice<00:02:29.680> as<00:02:29.860> much

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
other end so it's about twice as much

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.780 
other end so it's about twice as much
coiling<00:02:30.549> as<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.730> backpackers<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:33.489> virus

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
coiling as the backpackers that virus

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.440 
coiling as the backpackers that virus
method

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:03:01.990 

and<00:02:43.960> we're<00:02:44.470> starting<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.160> get<00:02:45.280> there

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.380 

okay<00:03:03.200> getting<00:03:04.200> down<00:03:04.469> towards<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.950> end<00:03:05.390> we're

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
okay getting down towards the end we're

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.509 
okay getting down towards the end we're
going<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.569> leave<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> good<00:03:07.170> six<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.980> eight<00:03:08.159> feet

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
going to leave a good six to eight feet

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.490 
going to leave a good six to eight feet
of<00:03:08.760> length<00:03:09.000> out<00:03:09.599> here<00:03:10.219> and<00:03:11.219> just<00:03:11.879> like<00:03:12.120> before

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
of length out here and just like before

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.610 
of length out here and just like before
now<00:03:13.500> we're<00:03:13.829> going<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.180> pull<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.329> off<00:03:15.620> we're

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
now we're going to pull this off we're

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.849 
now we're going to pull this off we're
just<00:03:16.769> going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.010> stand<00:03:17.219> up<00:03:18.139> I've<00:03:19.139> got<00:03:19.349> two<00:03:19.620> ends

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
just going to stand up I've got two ends

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.069 
just going to stand up I've got two ends
coming<00:03:20.040> off<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.790> coil<00:03:21.120> I've<00:03:21.810> got<00:03:21.989> it

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
coming off of this coil I've got it

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.520 
coming off of this coil I've got it
shortened<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.769> along<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:24.290> first<00:03:25.290> thing<00:03:25.469> I'm

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
shortened and along it first thing I'm

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.910 
shortened and along it first thing I'm
going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.420> take<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.780> short<00:03:28.500> end<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
going to do is take the short end and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.369 
going to do is take the short end and
I'm<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:30.000> going<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.209> bend<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.689> back<00:03:31.010> okay<00:03:33.379> so

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
I'm just going to bend it back okay so

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.089 
I'm just going to bend it back okay so
that<00:03:34.500> I've<00:03:34.620> got<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.060> small<00:03:36.090> length<00:03:36.599> here

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
that I've got it's a small length here

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.929 
that I've got it's a small length here
now<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.250> tedious<00:03:38.760> part<00:03:40.069> is<00:03:41.069> winding<00:03:41.730> this

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
now the tedious part is winding this

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.780 
now the tedious part is winding this
back<00:03:42.180> through<00:03:42.829> for<00:03:43.829> those<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.639> are

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
back through for those of you that are

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.619 
back through for those of you that are
familiar<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.530> an<00:03:47.459> identical<00:03:48.000> technique

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
familiar this is an identical technique

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.890 
familiar this is an identical technique

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
after every coil I like to cinch it down

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.560 
after every coil I like to cinch it down
tight<00:04:14.909> and<00:04:15.599> make<00:04:15.780> sure<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.109> every<00:04:16.470> coil<00:04:16.799> is

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
tight and make sure that every coil is

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.330 
tight and make sure that every coil is
butted<00:04:18.570> right<00:04:18.900> up<00:04:19.079> against<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> previous<00:04:19.829> one

just<00:04:24.919> keep<00:04:25.100> going<00:04:26.199> it<00:04:27.199> takes<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:28.040> neat

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
just keep going it takes on really neat

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:43.960 
just keep going it takes on really neat

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.050 

and<00:04:44.410> just<00:04:45.410> keep<00:04:45.620> going<00:04:46.100> until<00:04:46.280> this<00:04:46.700> length

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
and just keep going until this length

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.300 
and just keep going until this length
gets<00:04:47.330> down<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:48.410> where<00:04:48.560> it's<00:04:48.710> about<00:04:48.920> even<00:04:49.220> with

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
gets down to where it's about even with

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.670 
gets down to where it's about even with
this<00:04:49.490> one<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:50.570> can<00:04:50.720> kind<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.960> Judge<00:04:51.230> how<00:04:51.260> many

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
this one you can kind of Judge how many

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.250 
this one you can kind of Judge how many
coils<00:04:51.920> that<00:04:52.190> should<00:04:52.430> be<00:04:52.630> depending<00:04:53.630> on<00:04:53.780> what

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
coils that should be depending on what

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.390 
coils that should be depending on what
you<00:04:54.470> want<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.530> about<00:04:57.800> where<00:04:58.070> I<00:04:58.100> like

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
you want and this is about where I like

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.890 
you want and this is about where I like
it<00:04:58.610> because<00:04:58.880> they<00:04:59.000> make<00:04:59.180> them<00:04:59.330> again<00:04:59.630> I<00:04:59.690> can

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
it because they make them again I can

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.290 
it because they make them again I can
always<00:05:00.110> keep<00:05:00.440> an<00:05:00.590> eye<00:05:00.740> on<00:05:01.070> where<00:05:01.760> those<00:05:01.970> ends

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
always keep an eye on where those ends

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.360 
always keep an eye on where those ends
are<00:05:03.160> okay<00:05:04.160> so<00:05:04.480> final<00:05:05.480> step<00:05:05.800> pass<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:07.040> through

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
are okay so final step pass it through

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.360 
are okay so final step pass it through
that<00:05:07.670> small<00:05:07.970> loop<00:05:08.210> recreated<00:05:08.920> pull<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.070> kind

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
that small loop recreated pull it kind

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.940 
that small loop recreated pull it kind
of<00:05:10.400> tight<00:05:10.610> now<00:05:11.120> go<00:05:11.330> over<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.960> other<00:05:12.560> one

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
of tight now go over to the other one

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.220 
of tight now go over to the other one
and<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.660> cinch<00:05:14.660> it<00:05:14.810> down<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.780> creates<00:05:17.930> a

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
and just cinch it down and it creates a

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.930 
and just cinch it down and it creates a
really<00:05:18.380> compact<00:05:19.340> not<00:05:19.700> it's<00:05:20.570> not<00:05:20.900> too<00:05:21.290> bulky

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
really compact not it's not too bulky

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.520 
really compact not it's not too bulky
this<00:05:22.940> thing<00:05:23.210> can<00:05:23.660> be<00:05:23.810> carried<00:05:24.080> just<00:05:24.380> by

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
this thing can be carried just by

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.220 
this thing can be carried just by
wearing<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.980> over<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.430> shoulder<00:05:25.640> and<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:27.080> like

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
wearing it over the shoulder and I like

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.710 
wearing it over the shoulder and I like
to<00:05:27.380> keep<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.740> knot<00:05:27.980> up<00:05:28.280> here<00:05:28.940> because<00:05:29.180> if<00:05:29.540> the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
to keep the knot up here because if the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.140 
to keep the knot up here because if the
weight<00:05:29.900> of<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.140> knot<00:05:30.410> gets<00:05:31.040> down<00:05:31.340> here<00:05:31.730> when

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
weight of this knot gets down here when

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.510 
weight of this knot gets down here when
you're<00:05:32.300> hiking<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:33.110> swings<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:33.830> it's<00:05:33.920> it's

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
you're hiking it swings and it's it's

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.190 
you're hiking it swings and it's it's
like<00:05:34.730> kind<00:05:34.970> of<00:05:35.030> like<00:05:35.150> wearing<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.540> cinder<00:05:35.960> block

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
like kind of like wearing a cinder block

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.150 
like kind of like wearing a cinder block
on<00:05:36.980> a<00:05:37.430> bandolier<00:05:38.090> so<00:05:39.020> right<00:05:39.890> about<00:05:40.100> there

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
on a bandolier so right about there

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.640 
on a bandolier so right about there
you're<00:05:40.550> good<00:05:40.670> to<00:05:40.790> go<00:05:41.110> now<00:05:42.110> again<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.440> don't

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
you're good to go now again I don't

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.580 
you're good to go now again I don't
prefer<00:05:43.160> this<00:05:43.340> technique<00:05:44.170> because<00:05:45.170> it's<00:05:45.530> a

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
prefer this technique because it's a

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.970 
prefer this technique because it's a
hassle<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:46.280> takes<00:05:46.670> longer<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:48.410> puts<00:05:48.680> a

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
hassle it takes longer and it puts a

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.430 
hassle it takes longer and it puts a
twist<00:05:49.640> in<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.060> rope<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.110> really

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
twist in the rope that is really

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.210 
twist in the rope that is really
difficult<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.640> deal<00:05:52.790> with<00:05:53.030> but<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:54.220> real

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
difficult to deal with but the real

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.370 
difficult to deal with but the real
advantage<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.910> this<00:05:56.120> is<00:05:56.720> if<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.080> have<00:05:57.230> an

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
advantage of this is if you have an

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.220 
advantage of this is if you have an
emergency<00:05:57.890> you<00:05:58.310> can<00:05:58.850> actually<00:05:59.000> use<00:05:59.480> this<00:05:59.840> type

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
emergency you can actually use this type

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.800 
emergency you can actually use this type
of<00:06:00.260> coil<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:01.400> carry<00:06:01.700> an<00:06:01.880> injured<00:06:02.270> person<00:06:02.450> out

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
of coil to carry an injured person out

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.400 
of coil to carry an injured person out
and<00:06:03.500> it's<00:06:04.220> just<00:06:04.460> me<00:06:04.760> here

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
and it's just me here

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.750 
and it's just me here
so<00:06:06.410> I'm<00:06:06.560> going<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.800> have<00:06:06.919> to<00:06:07.160> kind<00:06:07.370> of<00:06:07.430> do<00:06:07.610> the

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
so I'm going to have to kind of do the

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.450 
so I'm going to have to kind of do the
role<00:06:07.970> of<00:06:08.000> two<00:06:08.330> people<00:06:08.840> but<00:06:09.440> basically<00:06:09.890> what

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
role of two people but basically what

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.690 
role of two people but basically what
you<00:06:10.610> do<00:06:10.790> is<00:06:11.000> you<00:06:11.750> separate<00:06:12.350> out<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:12.710> coil<00:06:12.980> so

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
you do is you separate out the coil so

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.460 
you do is you separate out the coil so
you've<00:06:13.820> got<00:06:13.970> two<00:06:14.210> loops<00:06:14.480> like<00:06:14.690> this<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.290> by

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
you've got two loops like this and by

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.840 
you've got two loops like this and by
the<00:06:15.530> way<00:06:15.680> this<00:06:15.740> is<00:06:15.919> pretty<00:06:16.220> strong<00:06:16.520> it's<00:06:16.730> going

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
the way this is pretty strong it's going

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.190 
the way this is pretty strong it's going
to<00:06:16.940> hold<00:06:17.030> especially<00:06:17.600> if<00:06:17.690> you<00:06:17.780> cinch<00:06:18.050> it<00:06:18.169> down

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
to hold especially if you cinch it down

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.870 
to hold especially if you cinch it down
tight<00:06:18.650> now

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
tight now

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.670
