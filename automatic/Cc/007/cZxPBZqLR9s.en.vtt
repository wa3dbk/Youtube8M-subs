00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.050 
regardless keep blasting away there's
another<00:01:51.189> mini<00:01:51.460> kit<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:53.130> keep<00:01:54.130> blasting<00:01:54.430> keep

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
another mini kit and keep blasting keep

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.770 
another mini kit and keep blasting keep
blasting

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
blasting

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.249 
blasting
so<00:01:56.439> they<00:01:56.619> say<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.189> there<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.970> fifth<00:01:58.930> mini

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
so they say that there is a fifth mini

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.469 
so they say that there is a fifth mini
kit<00:01:59.590> from<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.420> blasted<00:02:01.439> purple<00:02:02.439> rocket<00:02:03.479> you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
kit from a blasted purple rocket you

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.270 
kit from a blasted purple rocket you
know<00:02:04.600> I'm<00:02:04.869> watching<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.470> for<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.770> second<00:02:06.189> or

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
know I'm watching this for the second or

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.399 
know I'm watching this for the second or
third<00:02:06.310> time<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.299> don't<00:02:07.360> see<00:02:07.930> one<00:02:08.169> come

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
third time now and I don't see one come

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.510 
third time now and I don't see one come
from<00:02:08.439> a<00:02:08.649> second<00:02:08.829> or<00:02:08.919> three<00:02:09.039> rocket

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
from a second or three rocket

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.440 
from a second or three rocket
see<00:02:09.670> an<00:02:09.790> extra<00:02:10.210> crate<00:02:10.510> so<00:02:11.220> look<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.520> crate

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
see an extra crate so look for a crate

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540 
see an extra crate so look for a crate
or<00:02:13.660> look<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> purple<00:02:14.740> rocket<00:02:15.100> either<00:02:15.280> way<00:02:15.520> I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
or look for a purple rocket either way I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.070 
or look for a purple rocket either way I
assume<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.390> nurse<00:02:16.540> would<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> same

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
assume that you nurse would be the same

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.310 
assume that you nurse would be the same
as<00:02:17.200> mine<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.680> it'll<00:02:18.130> probably<00:02:18.160> be<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.520> crate<00:02:19.320> so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
as mine so it'll probably be a crate so

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.260 
as mine so it'll probably be a crate so
we're<00:02:20.500> gonna<00:02:20.620> keep<00:02:20.920> blasting<00:02:21.280> anything<00:02:21.850> that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
we're gonna keep blasting anything that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.390 
we're gonna keep blasting anything that
gets<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.540> our<00:02:22.630> way<00:02:22.690> if<00:02:23.320> we<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.710> close<00:02:24.010> enough

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
gets in our way if we get close enough

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.760 
gets in our way if we get close enough
Batman<00:02:24.910> will<00:02:25.210> shoot<00:02:25.660> out<00:02:25.900> his<00:02:25.930> grapple<00:02:26.590> hook

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
Batman will shoot out his grapple hook

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.830 
Batman will shoot out his grapple hook

there the little gold thing we're gonna
go<00:02:35.350> ahead<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.560> build<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.040> real<00:02:36.220> quick<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.610> it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
go ahead and build it real quick and it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.550 
go ahead and build it real quick and it
gets<00:02:37.120> some<00:02:37.300> sort<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.570> heat<00:02:37.840> lock<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.230> missile

and grapple that hook on the left and
then<00:03:12.820> deal<00:03:13.330> with<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.540> driver<00:03:13.780> inside<00:03:14.170> I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
then deal with the driver inside I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.790 
then deal with the driver inside I
figured<00:03:15.850> that<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.120> out<00:03:16.300> one<00:03:16.570> here<00:03:17.320> sooner<00:03:17.740> or

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
figured that this out one here sooner or

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.470 
figured that this out one here sooner or
later<00:03:17.890> alright<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.430> pull<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.760> open<00:03:18.910> expose

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
later alright so I pull it open expose

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.960 
later alright so I pull it open expose

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
was talking about Batman spawning into

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.650 
was talking about Batman spawning into
the<00:03:24.340> fire<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.850> was<00:03:24.970> last<00:03:25.209> video<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.570> mentioned

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
the fire it was last video I mentioned

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.810 
the fire it was last video I mentioned
that<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.290> look<00:03:27.100> at<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.280> spawning<00:03:27.610> and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
that but look at that spawning and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.250 
that but look at that spawning and
spawning<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.209> spawn<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.660> he<00:03:28.720> kept<00:03:28.959> doing<00:03:29.110> it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
spawning the spawn and he kept doing it

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.750 
spawning the spawn and he kept doing it
until<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.560> finally<00:03:29.860> was<00:03:30.100> able<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.340> switch<00:03:30.580> to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
until I finally was able to switch to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.730 
until I finally was able to switch to
Superman<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.209> then<00:03:31.510> Superman<00:03:31.840> was<00:03:32.260> able<00:03:32.560> to

Superman and then Superman was able to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.820 
Superman and then Superman was able to
put<00:03:33.520> out<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.640> fire<00:03:34.350> we'll<00:03:35.350> finish<00:03:35.530> off<00:03:35.800> that

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
put out the fire we'll finish off that

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
I guess that's cheating I mean if that's

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.879 
I guess that's cheating I mean if that's
the<00:04:50.660> case<00:04:50.870> if<00:04:51.020> that's<00:04:51.139> cheating<00:04:51.680> then

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889
