back doors of the shed from which he
will<00:01:52.360> emerge<00:01:53.880> tomorrow<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.310> one<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
will emerge tomorrow this is one of the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.640 
will emerge tomorrow this is one of the
reinforcing<00:01:58.270> patches<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.110> designed<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
reinforcing patches that is designed to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.520 
reinforcing patches that is designed to
protect<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.190> hull<00:02:00.430> from<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.690> slings<00:02:02.140> as

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
protect the hull from the slings as

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.940 
protect the hull from the slings as
she's<00:02:03.520> rolled<00:02:03.820> over<00:02:04.270> she's<00:02:05.050> made<00:02:05.290> from<00:02:05.620> foam

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
she's rolled over she's made from foam

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.540 
she's rolled over she's made from foam
and<00:02:06.370> steel<00:02:07.210> bars<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.649> idea<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.160> just<00:02:09.429> to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
and steel bars and the idea is just to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.450 
and steel bars and the idea is just to
spread<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.149> load<00:02:10.410> far<00:02:11.410> more<00:02:11.710> over<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> hold

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
spread the load far more over the hold

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.410 
spread the load far more over the hold
that<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.000> slings<00:02:13.300> would<00:02:13.600> do<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.110> their<00:02:14.290> own

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
that the slings would do on their own

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.030 
that the slings would do on their own
inside<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.660> hull<00:02:16.870> there<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> counterpart

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
inside the hull there is a counterpart

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.460 
inside the hull there is a counterpart
spreader<00:02:18.580> bar<00:02:18.850> which<00:02:19.420> stops<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> two<00:02:20.290> edges

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
spreader bar which stops the two edges

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.870 
spreader bar which stops the two edges
of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.890> hull<00:02:21.070> from<00:02:21.340> getting<00:02:21.610> compressed

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
of the hull from getting compressed

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.150 
of the hull from getting compressed
together<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.990> will<00:02:23.200> show<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> it's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
together which will show you in a it's

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.890 
together which will show you in a it's
just<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> aft<00:02:26.370> reinforcing<00:02:27.370> patch<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
just the aft reinforcing patch on the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.470 
just the aft reinforcing patch on the
port<00:02:29.140> side<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.920> little<00:02:30.490> bit<00:02:30.670> less<00:02:30.940> steel<00:02:31.240> work

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
port side a little bit less steel work

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.810 
port side a little bit less steel work
at<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.870> zone<00:02:32.250> obviously<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:33.430> she's

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
at this zone obviously because she's

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.390 
at this zone obviously because she's
lighter<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.840> stir<00:02:35.590> than<00:02:35.860> she<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
lighter in the stir than she is in the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.450 
lighter in the stir than she is in the
bow

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.020 

here<00:02:40.090> we<00:02:40.210> are<00:02:40.390> inside<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.880> transfer<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.970> the

all the reinforcing here we just stroll

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.610 
all the reinforcing here we just stroll
across<00:02:50.510> will<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.630> able<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> look<00:02:51.990> up<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.380> big

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620

side to the other and that is the
temporary<00:03:11.200> reinforcing<00:03:12.099> structure<00:03:13.260> that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
temporary reinforcing structure that

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.929 
temporary reinforcing structure that
spreads<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.890> lows<00:03:15.069> between<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.760> two
