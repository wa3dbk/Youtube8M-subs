the<00:04:25.970> nine<00:04:26.180> but<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.750> think<00:04:27.020> Kasey<00:04:27.290> Kahne<00:04:27.740> in<00:04:27.920> that

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
the nine but I think Kasey Kahne in that

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.670 
the nine but I think Kasey Kahne in that
nine<00:04:28.310> car<00:04:28.700> he<00:04:28.910> was<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.180> real<00:04:29.360> winner<00:04:30.080> on<00:04:30.470> those

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
nine car he was the real winner on those

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.710

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
green flag stops but remember he was one

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.360 
green flag stops but remember he was one

we can - maybe has a soft tire here and
now<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:31.800> think<00:05:31.949> it<00:05:32.279> just<00:05:32.399> gets<00:05:32.639> out<00:05:32.819> from<00:05:32.969> under

now I think it just gets out from under
him<00:05:33.419> cars<00:05:34.139> are<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.379> little<00:05:34.499> loose<00:05:34.919> up<00:05:35.129> off<00:05:35.279> the
