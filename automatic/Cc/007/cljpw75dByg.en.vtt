tech21 impact mesh case for the Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:05.040> s5<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.970> uses<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.359> d3o<00:00:06.990> protection

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
Galaxy s5 this uses the d3o protection

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.140 
Galaxy s5 this uses the d3o protection
material<00:00:08.069> which<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> really<00:00:09.059> cool

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
material which is a really cool

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.780 
material which is a really cool
substance<00:00:09.780> which<00:00:10.019> allows<00:00:10.650> any<00:00:11.040> impact<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.610> be

substance which allows any impact to be

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.879 
substance which allows any impact to be
kind<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.330> shocked<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.840> dissipated<00:00:13.469> into<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
kind of shocked and dissipated into the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.499 
kind of shocked and dissipated into the
material<00:00:14.370> rather<00:00:14.580> than<00:00:14.849> touch<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.210> device

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
material rather than touch the device

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.359 
material rather than touch the device
itself<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.560> has<00:00:16.680> been<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> protect<00:00:17.250> your

whatsoever it takes any kind of shock or
impact<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.899> dissipates<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> intellectual

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
impact and dissipates the intellectual

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.790 
impact and dissipates the intellectual
material<00:00:35.489> itself<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> takes<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.840> impact

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
material itself so that takes the impact

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
material itself so that takes the impact
out<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.250> drops<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> puts<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> case

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
out of drops and puts it into the case

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.900 
out of drops and puts it into the case
rather<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> device<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.129> yeah<00:00:41.489> you're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
rather than to the device so yeah you're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.220 
rather than to the device so yeah you're
gonna<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.360> phone<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.570> fully<00:00:42.960> covered

this one is the the clear version for

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
this one is the the clear version for
the<00:00:55.020> s5<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.280> I've<00:00:56.430> said<00:00:56.460> lots<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the s5 but like I've said lots of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
the s5 but like I've said lots of
different<00:00:57.090> models<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.510> well<00:00:57.690> I've<00:00:58.109> actually

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
different models as well I've actually

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
different models as well I've actually
done<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> review<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.340> note<00:00:59.579> 3<00:00:59.910> case<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.329> well

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
done a review of the note 3 case as well

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
done a review of the note 3 case as well
and<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.680> smoky<00:01:02.489> color<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.850> well

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and we did that in a smoky color as well

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.399 
and we did that in a smoky color as well
so<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> different<00:01:04.140> color

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so you can see a bit of different color

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.570 
so you can see a bit of different color
another<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:04.979> good<00:01:05.159> thing<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.519> about

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
another little good thing I like about

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
another little good thing I like about
this<00:01:05.850> case<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> attention<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> detail<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
this case is the attention to detail so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
this case is the attention to detail so
that<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.799> tech21<00:01:08.100> branding<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> very

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that the tech21 branding at the very

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
that the tech21 branding at the very
bottom<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> case<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.110> nice<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.560> stands<00:01:10.770> out

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
bottom of the case is nice it stands out

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
bottom of the case is nice it stands out
very<00:01:11.159> clear<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> gives

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
very clear and there just kind of gives

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
very clear and there just kind of gives
it<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> nice<00:01:13.110> extra<00:01:13.380> touch<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> d4

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it a nice extra touch as well as the d4

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.640 
it a nice extra touch as well as the d4
winding<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> side<00:01:15.600> another<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.619> thing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
winding on the side another little thing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
winding on the side another little thing
that<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.250> quite<00:01:17.400> cool<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that is really quite cool is that the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
that is really quite cool is that the
fact<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.439> phone<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
fact that when you put your phone in the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
fact that when you put your phone in the
case<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.549> has<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> recess<00:01:21.540> around<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
case actually has a recess around the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
case actually has a recess around the
screen<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.369> use<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.520> screen

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
screen so if you don't use a screen

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
screen so if you don't use a screen
protector<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.270> many<00:01:24.450> people<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.960> but

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
protector I know many people do but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.899 
protector I know many people do but
there<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.890> still<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> few<00:01:26.220> people<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.610> don't

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
there are still a few people that don't

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.190 
there are still a few people that don't
like<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> feel<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> screen

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like you know the feel of a screen

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.340 
like you know the feel of a screen
protector<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.939> does<00:01:30.119> give<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.509> recess<00:01:31.049> of
