00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
experiences to create a listening tool

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.450 
experiences to create a listening tool
with<00:02:07.460> undertale<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.119> there<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:08.840> turned<00:02:09.140> on

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460

be<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> little<00:02:21.050> bit<00:02:21.200> clearer<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:22.070> gonna<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.340> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
be a little bit clearer it's gonna be a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.590 
be a little bit clearer it's gonna be a
lot<00:02:22.459> sharper<00:02:22.700> there's<00:02:23.060> gonna<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.300> lot<00:02:23.450> more

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
lot sharper there's gonna be a lot more

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.240 
lot sharper there's gonna be a lot more
range<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:24.290> you're<00:02:24.410> listening<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.160> if

range to what you're listening to so if

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.800 
range to what you're listening to so if
you're<00:02:25.370> watching<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.790> movie<00:02:25.970> you're<00:02:26.720> gonna

feel like those sound effects are really
coming<00:02:28.430> at<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.820> as<00:02:29.000> opposed<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.570> you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
coming at you as opposed to just you

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.090 
coming at you as opposed to just you
know<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.990> standard<00:02:30.350> flat<00:02:30.590> sound<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:31.010> you

know the standard flat sound that you

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.680 
know the standard flat sound that you
might<00:02:31.250> get<00:02:31.459> even<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.240> were<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.660> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
might get even if you were to have a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.600 
might get even if you were to have a
phone<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.020> an<00:02:33.140> equalizer<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.489> think

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
phone with an equalizer to it so I think

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.040 
phone with an equalizer to it so I think
it's<00:02:34.850> pretty<00:02:34.970> awesome<00:02:35.180> I'll<00:02:35.600> give<00:02:35.959> you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
another little demo here with some

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.310 
another little demo here with some
actual<00:02:37.459> music<00:02:37.880> playing<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.570> phone<00:02:40.270> so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.240 

this<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:46.010> right<00:02:46.250> now<00:02:47.500> since<00:02:48.500> Ally<00:02:48.709> can't<00:02:49.040> I

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
this is on right now since Ally can't I

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.100 
this is on right now since Ally can't I
hear<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.670> crispness<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.420> actual<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.080> know

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
hear the crispness of actual you know

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.500 
hear the crispness of actual you know
guitars<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:52.489> hear<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.910> full<00:02:53.120> breadth<00:02:53.390> of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
guitars to hear like the full breadth of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.830 
guitars to hear like the full breadth of
all<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> sound<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:55.459> with<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.640> dolls<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
all the sound and then with the dolls it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.360 
all the sound and then with the dolls it
almost<00:02:57.050> sounds<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.350> little<00:02:57.530> bit<00:02:57.620> lower<00:02:57.830> volume

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
almost sounds a little bit lower volume

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.550 
almost sounds a little bit lower volume
altogether<00:02:58.910> doesn't<00:02:59.600> quite<00:02:59.720> sound<00:03:00.050> as<00:03:00.290> clear

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
altogether doesn't quite sound as clear

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.060 
altogether doesn't quite sound as clear
and<00:03:00.860> sharp<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.290> really<00:03:03.590> does<00:03:03.800> make<00:03:03.830> a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
and sharp so it really does make a

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.530 
and sharp so it really does make a
difference<00:03:04.160> again<00:03:05.120> they<00:03:05.209> also<00:03:05.330> have

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
difference again they also have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.020 
difference again they also have
different<00:03:05.810> modes<00:03:05.930> here<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:06.799> listening<00:03:07.610> if

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
different modes here it's listening if

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.449 
different modes here it's listening if
you're<00:03:08.180> making<00:03:08.299> phone<00:03:08.600> calls<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.860> know<00:03:09.980> just

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
you're making phone calls you know just

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.770 
you're making phone calls you know just
listen<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.760> audio<00:03:11.060> things<00:03:11.269> like<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.600> there's

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
listen to audio things like that there's

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.050 
listen to audio things like that there's
a<00:03:11.840> more<00:03:12.019> specific<00:03:12.290> voice<00:03:12.650> mode<00:03:12.950> game<00:03:13.850> mode

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
a more specific voice mode game mode

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.190 
a more specific voice mode game mode
again<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.630> kind<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.900> get<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.140> sense

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
again so you can kind of get that sense

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.050 
again so you can kind of get that sense
of<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.769> year<00:03:15.950> playing<00:03:16.190> like<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> shooter<00:03:16.820> that

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
of this year playing like a shooter that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.340 
of this year playing like a shooter that
you<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.450> student<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.870> coming<00:03:17.989> from<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
you know the student is coming from the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.990
