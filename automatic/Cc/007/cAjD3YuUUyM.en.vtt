 I really love trojan drill and they are very 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.130
 a big fan of trends is that they 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.350
 just talking about summer, all this will be 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.810
 dress here you can only these 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.930
 Five things are the most trends and things in 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.800
 this year this is on this summer or autumn and 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.410
 All the same, there may be another 5 or me 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.250
 we don't like it very hard for us 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.260
 it is very so calculated so that you 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.240
 something must keep up all the time or not 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.870
 you do not have time because I do not really like 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.510
 trends but sometimes passes trends that you 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.750
 can adapt to your style and you don't 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.240
 should change them here let's tell me very 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.110
 like on and you know my africa ambal 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.859
 here are 7 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.590
 and my shoes that they are us doctors 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.940
 it is generally called with nikolaevich and 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.970
 at 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.040
 she is not very fashionable as I understand 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.470
 it's not such a big trend but me 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.540
 it's not interesting to me it doesn't matter to me not 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.370
 like because I will not pester them 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.300
 dress mine what mod said it is 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.900
 We have already passed last season you can not 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.390
 live in with your wardrobe according to the season 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.660
 for the season of course if you are manner it is already 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:51.160
 another question but all ordinary people like me 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.960
 I can not and therefore I think it is 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.750
 can help you because you can 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.290
 find something what is it about i like it 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.590
 i want i will keep it cool because 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.470
 that here I do not like grass well I certainly 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.090
 I found a couple of trends that I just 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.260
 adapted to my styles like that to me 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.840
 like to dress 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.970
 Century last advice that I think can 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.669
 help you in your search for style this 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.919
 just go shopping to see what 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.040
 in stores that you like and do not say 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.630
 buy but the whole idea is what you 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.940
 just went shopping and watching 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.550
 what is there from andrew if you 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.919
 like to poison shirt and sweater and you 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.380
 know about my grandmother already such a tie 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:39.520
 or i can take my old shirt and and 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.390
 remake it cool what not to go 50 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.060
 dollars or how many rubles you pay 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.900
 for this shirt and sling it did at home 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.350
 and 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.390
 you just get new ideas i think 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.880
 it's very interesting when you take that 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.419
 what is and change and the fact that 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.780
 sometimes you have it even cooler than that 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.550
 what's in the shop then yes try 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.430
 look maybe it will help you 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.400
 and it will be very nice to watch that 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:15.610
