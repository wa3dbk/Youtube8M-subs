00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 to take your life away from the green 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:57.600
 If your life were to lose a green if I 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.850
 I would spend it because you bite me 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.320
 I would pass 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 green that bites 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.750

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.750
 steak if your little mouth out of topic 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:31.130

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.780
 message of sanz 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.569
 and I continue 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.310
 alexia carlos alirio of judges please 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.530
 good 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.720
 they entered with all attitude since 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.920
 they showed up here on the track to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.200
 center the stage I gave them with all the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.880
 that's how they ended and this is about 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.519
 that they come to have fun that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.519
 have all the attitude and happiness 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.670
 I want to know what the dance of Don thinks 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.930
 Robert 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.640
 tell you 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.010
 tell me that I really liked the energy 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.299
 but we want your comment of the dance 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:46.219
 there is an important thing the energy to 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:49.010
 all displacement none the more dancing 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.500
 it could not always be great communication 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 between the premiums but a little bit is missing 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.659
 of projection for what we are here 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.269
 present I missed that was the one but that 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.599
 I put you otherwise I liked the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.599
 dance 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.340
 they are not professionals 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.560
 they did what they could here I believe 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.330
 how much effort is and is applauded 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.220
 also that they will be presented before 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.410
 million viewers and present a 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.270
 number of forums or as they did I know 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.370
 that you are a professional but they are 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.170
 some kids and I think that work what 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.100
 they did well they saw the expectations at 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 see such 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.760
 professionals yes there I believe that children and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.830
 we could see the subjects 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.220
 participants maybe they can dance 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.220
 best 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.460
 age has nothing to do with 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.100
 product if when you come here you know what 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.620
 that they will see millions but we have 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.600
 that we find reason on the one hand 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.790
 we are at a time that we already have a 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.420
 very high level are the finalists with 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.070
 the winners of each of each month and 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.810
 on the other hand because it is very nice to see 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.460
 the emotional part the part of the 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.470
 family the part of the desire that you 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.100
 Then they are both right 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.100
 they do not fight 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.650
 we have some food 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.230
 today mom is also a little 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.760
 confused because on the one hand the criticism 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.979
 from the lord my trick 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.650
 it always comes in handy because it's a big 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.729
 but on the other hand your heart ached 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.120
 when you listened 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.880
 that opinion that you feel the truth 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.310
 it's a symptom I need very proud of my 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.150
 carlita's daughter have thrown many 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.370
 you have suffered a lot this I am very 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.160
 content the truth and accept the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.160
 everyone's advice to always improve
