00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
about that my camera crashed again the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.140 
about that my camera crashed again the
batteries<00:03:42.690> died<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:44.080> think<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.160> camera<00:03:45.580> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
batteries died I think this camera I

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.670 
batteries died I think this camera I
well<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.020> been<00:03:47.230> old<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.650> all<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:49.680> for

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
well it's been old and all that so for

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.670 
well it's been old and all that so for
some<00:03:50.920> reason<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.370> uses<00:03:51.790> up<00:03:51.940> battery<00:03:52.680> power

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
some reason it uses up battery power

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.670 
some reason it uses up battery power
very<00:03:54.130> quickly<00:03:54.460> I<00:03:54.850> put<00:03:55.750> new<00:03:55.930> batteries<00:03:56.110> in<00:03:56.350> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
very quickly I put new batteries in and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.870 
very quickly I put new batteries in and
a<00:03:56.740> few<00:03:56.920> minutes<00:03:57.160> later<00:03:57.340> somehow<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
a few minutes later somehow the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.660 
a few minutes later somehow the
batteries<00:03:58.270> are<00:03:58.420> dead<00:03:58.920> not<00:03:59.920> sure<00:04:00.130> exactly<00:04:00.460> why

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
batteries are dead not sure exactly why

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.120 
batteries are dead not sure exactly why
