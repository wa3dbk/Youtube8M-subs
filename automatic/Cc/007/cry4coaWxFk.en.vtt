00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.770 
works so it's kind of nice to see that
happening<00:01:01.879> although<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.329> problem<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.749> that

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
happening although the problem is that

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.450 
happening although the problem is that
it's<00:01:03.260> already<00:01:03.469> out<00:01:03.559> there<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.129> custom

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
it's already out there the custom

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.520 
it's already out there the custom
firmware<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:04.940> distributed<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:05.869> far<00:01:06.140> he

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
firmware is distributed so far he

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.380 
firmware is distributed so far he
doesn't<00:01:06.860> have<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.220> do<00:01:07.340> anything<00:01:07.610> he<00:01:08.060> doesn't

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
doesn't have to do anything he doesn't

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.210 
doesn't have to do anything he doesn't
have<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.750> push<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.320> at<00:01:09.590> all<00:01:09.710> because<00:01:09.920> it's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
have to push it at all because it's

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920 
have to push it at all because it's
already<00:01:10.520> out<00:01:10.550> there<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.090> spreading<00:01:11.510> through

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
already out there and spreading through

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.680 
already out there and spreading through
his<00:01:12.140> vast<00:01:12.380> network<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.360> restraining

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
his vast network so the restraining

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.150 
his vast network so the restraining
order<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:15.050> good<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.260> see<00:01:15.410> it<00:01:15.560> seems<00:01:15.830> like<00:01:16.010> the

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
order it's good to see it seems like the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.190 
order it's good to see it seems like the
courts<00:01:16.490> are<00:01:16.580> kind<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:17.060> going<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.810> favor<00:01:18.050> of

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200
