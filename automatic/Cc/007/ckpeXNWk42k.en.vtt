00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.490
 Europe was immersed in a war 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.290
 blood and fire 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.290
 and we are going to succumb all 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.670
 the Allied troops had landed and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 They were moving towards Paris 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 the Germans planned to destroy everything 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.470
 raze everything especially paris the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 blasting the bridges will cause a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.900
 spectacular grown of sena 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.759
 continue Mr. land in five minutes 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.910
 after the bridges the cathedral of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.480
 notre-dame and the opera will not be available 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.480
 feader orders 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.880
 because he insists on destroying the lord 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.880
 governor 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.290
 that is not your business, normal sir and not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.329
 is wrong if they had not asked me 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.760
 contacting you would follow a going 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.590
 oblivious to everything as all the people who go to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 kill shortly you can leave 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.090
 talking and gesturing incessantly are 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.650
 civilians for whom this war is a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.280
 aberration and they have not committed the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.080
 lesser crime against you 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.820
 among those who will die how many dreams 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.270
 will have the age of theirs has thought 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.070
 in seeing 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.840
 I was assigned to Paris to reset 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.789
 order and I will do much more than is 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 what do you plan to do exactly 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.290
 crush all united to all 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.600
 I've been wrong with you general and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.580
 with me I thought that coming here they 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.060
 would dissuade from committing such madness 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.060
 but 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.800
 we will not see that dome 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.190
 and neither the louvre nor the plaza de la 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.310
 concord nor the children playing in the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.310
 parks or the two towers of notre damme 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.250
 everything must disappear forever 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 and you have no remorse no 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 what kind of man are you
