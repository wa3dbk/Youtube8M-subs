00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.480
 Now I'm not welcome to our channel 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.129
 of youtube of all dotcom circuit today 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.620
 let's do the test to this helmet 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.110
 Italian signature to me is the model s 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.879
 r sport and if you do not know is the helmet that 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.320
 it replaces its previous version the model 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.360
 of excel that to give you an idea 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.640
 it's a case that has been quite successful 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.290
 of the hand of world-class pilots like 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.379
 for example loris capirossi and rubÃ©n xaus 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.390
 in his last years max biaggi those 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.190
 last years of good competition this 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.200
 is the sport comes to replace that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.329
 excel model and is that the helmet with the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.059
 that has bet to raise to return to the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.070
 mass the high competition from hands of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.649
 pilots such as ares ring or 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.229
 andrea dovicioso Ducati team 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.670
 this fund by the external part the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.470
 The shell has been manufactured in two sizes 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.840
 a smaller one would understand the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.729
 size xs to size m and another one a little 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.350
 bigger than that of the size the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.840
 size xxl 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.759
 The manufacture of the shell use a 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400
 own compound that they call 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.190
 ricard boko which is a multiple compound 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.340
 that unites the figure that the fiber of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.110
 glass or kevlar and carbon resins 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.390
 to the extent that what we do with this 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.290
 because we gain a lot of lightness in fact it is 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.970
 The first thing that is going to call you 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.880
 attention and one of your strong points already 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.470
 that only weighs a thousand 250 grams is 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.270
 rather light something that is appreciated in 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.460
 a sports helmet and also brings 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.369
 great resistance in case we have 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.159
 impact while absorbing very well the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.810
 energy of that impact good how much 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.520
 the wings vents to the sockets of 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.979
 air has two one in the part 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.710
 top of the front screen and another on 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.670
 the part of the chin the part of the chin 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.190
 well its opening is forward is the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.600
 I design the truth that it's pretty 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.459
 opinion is pretty well achieved already 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.049
 that being a sports helmet we passed 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.019
 quite time squatting or under the 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.430
 dome and the introduction of air is 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.410
 pretty good the fluid it generates is 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.180
 pretty good comes in pretty help 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.150
 quite air what is the part of 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.360
 inside and avoid in case that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.849
 higher to visit it in the part 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.620
 superior we have it here in the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.750
 top part with one click opens 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.909
 completely and has the outputs of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.010
 air on the sides and in the part 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.900
 Rear spoiler for this part 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.420
 superior have applied the venturi effect 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.810
 that to summarize it briefly 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.810
 try to generate a depression in two 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.090
 by a channel decreasing the diameter of 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.799
 that conduit to accelerate the fluid of 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.140
 air and in this case the truth that they have 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.730
 got very well it shows quite the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.980
 moment that you make the opening you go to 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.049
 notice the air flow dissipates very well 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.209
 the heat and thank you enough about 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.599
 everything if we are going to give one more use 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.099
 sporty as to the 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.950
 aerodynamics of the helmet the truth is that 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.379
 it's worked hard in this case it's 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 has evolved a lot and it has 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.079
 worked mostly in wind tunnel 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.400
 with which a helmet is obtained 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.780
 quite aerodynamic what are you going to notice 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.389
 especially underway since it's a case 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.850
 that is going to make us wobble too much and 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.520
 it will not bother us in excess 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.160
 good as regards the screen the screen 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.320
 thermoformed one piece and has 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.970
 received anti-scratch treatment in the 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.460
 external and old part in the part 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.080
 internal data that we have to mention 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.510
 in this case since this screen of 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.670
 helmet that this is the sport 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.590
 comes without taking treatment 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.230
 Anti-fog does not come with system block 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.640
 only system but if we wanted that 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.380
 screen have we could acquire or not 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.670
 there would be a problem because if the screen 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.190
 which uses for example the replica of the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.720
 Andrea dovicioso helmet good for 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.980
 replace the screen quite easy 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.380
 we just have to open the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.660
 screen the clicks that we have in the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.460
 open them and with a tour towards 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.750
 upwards to the side and upwards of 45 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.640
 degrees 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.900
 simply doing this would the 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.730
 same operation piece on the opposite side 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.500
 and the screen will be outside for 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.190
 repeat the operation to put it would be 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.650
 the same 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.950
 enter the helmet or put the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.690
 screen in the open position 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.730
 equal 45 degrees in reverse and we close 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.230
 and the other part that we would have to do 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.670
 the same 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.670
 and we introduce the piece 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.840
 45 degrees and we would have enough 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.980
 simple and the pieces the truth that they are 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.450
 something that has that has this good 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.580
 helmet are and is that the pieces are from 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.680
 quite quality so the step of 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.340
 time and use I do not think it will be 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.340
 excessively affected 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.020
 good about the internal brand of 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.780
 helmet is made with coolmax fabric 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.980
 so we have a fabric that is 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.900
 breathable before the sole and anti-shaft 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.030
 sweat we can dismantle it all the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.830
 structure inside to wash it works 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.570
 with clicks on the inside too 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.180
 we have to cover part of the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.830
 chin guard to isolate us even more from now 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.920
 whether it's a winter of 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.270
 or cold or noise and also had 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.570
 one says the one that is removable in 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.570
 this 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.550
 As for the closing, it has closure of 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.170
 double ring you already know that you will close 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.050
 for this type of cases it is more 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.400
 recommended the safest and regarding 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.400
 design of this helmet what contario 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.730
 available in 13 types of colors three 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.770
 of them are plain colors and a monkey 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.930
 serial would be 14 a more helmet that would be 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.410
 the special edition of delicious andrea 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.930
 the price of this of this helmet is 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.510
 499 euros and our valuation on 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.190
 this sommelier sport the truth that for 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.020
 to be a sports helmet is pretty 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.790
 well it 's a pretty lightweight helmet is something 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.000
 more than what else will you call the 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.620
 attention is quite silent something that 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.600
 it will be appreciated and has a ventilation 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.640
 very good and the price that I think I think 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.640
 it's about the quality relationship 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.140
 quality-price is quite successful 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.080
 little more than this from this tester this 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.790
 fomi lsr sport helmet would remember 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.560
 simply that you can follow us 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.190
 through this youtube channel if 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.140
 subscribe to it 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.690
 and social networks either facebook twitter 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.190
 is very interesting and like our page
