wobbler to show them how to use it and
that<00:02:15.550> was<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> bad<00:02:16.570> idea

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.370 

I<00:02:22.650> ended<00:02:23.650> up<00:02:23.800> fighting<00:02:24.630> even<00:02:25.630> chippy<00:02:26.050> got<00:02:26.230> in

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
I ended up fighting even chippy got in

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.440 
I ended up fighting even chippy got in
on<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.680> action<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.730> when<00:02:27.940> after<00:02:28.030> butters

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
on that action and when after butters

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.900 
on that action and when after butters
turns<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> lowest<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.709> dog<00:02:30.040> hierarchy

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
turns the lowest on the dog hierarchy

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.670 
turns the lowest on the dog hierarchy
even<00:02:31.270> though<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.420> might<00:02:31.660> think<00:02:31.720> your<00:02:32.410> dogs

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
even though you might think your dogs

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.610 
even though you might think your dogs
won't<00:02:33.010> fight<00:02:33.280> over<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.209> just<00:02:34.420> when<00:02:35.140> food

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
won't fight over it it's just when food

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.740 
won't fight over it it's just when food
gets<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> picture<00:02:36.850> your<00:02:37.180> dog<00:02:37.390> becomes<00:02:37.690> a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
gets in the picture your dog becomes a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.320 
gets in the picture your dog becomes a
different<00:02:38.050> person<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.470> think<00:02:39.010> use<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.670> solo

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
different person I think use it solo

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.110 
different person I think use it solo
meaning<00:02:40.870> one<00:02:41.260> dog<00:02:41.470> at<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.770> time<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:42.700> make<00:02:42.940> sure

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
meaning one dog at a time just make sure

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.630 
meaning one dog at a time just make sure
