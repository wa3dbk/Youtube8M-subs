here at Indiana University and today
we're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.730> talk<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.030> dividing

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
we're going to talk about dividing

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.480 
we're going to talk about dividing
daffodil<00:00:10.019> bulbs<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.679> why<00:00:11.010> would<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.309> need<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
daffodil bulbs and why would you need to

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.709 
daffodil bulbs and why would you need to
do<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.880> when<00:00:12.059> sometimes<00:00:12.269> they're<00:00:12.599> only

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
do that when sometimes they're only

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.060 
do that when sometimes they're only
twenty-five<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.259> fifty<00:00:13.530> cents<00:00:13.950> apiece

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
twenty-five or fifty cents apiece

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.490 
twenty-five or fifty cents apiece
because<00:00:15.030> new<00:00:15.269> varieties<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> pinks<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
because new varieties with the pinks and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.560 
because new varieties with the pinks and
reds<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.949> some<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.250> cool<00:00:17.369> ones<00:00:17.789> are<00:00:18.000> up<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
reds and some really cool ones are up to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.150 
reds and some really cool ones are up to
fifty<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> hundred<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.500> five<00:00:19.680> dollars<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
fifty to a hundred and five dollars a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.599 
fifty to a hundred and five dollars a
bulb<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.619> that's<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> kind<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.220> normally

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
bulb so that's not the kind we normally

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
bulb so that's not the kind we normally
buy<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.180> someone<00:00:24.420> gives<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:24.720> two<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> want

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
buy but if someone gives them two I want

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.720 
buy but if someone gives them two I want
to<00:00:25.380> make<00:00:25.529> sure<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> make<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.340> far<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.670> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
to make sure I make them go as far as I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
to make sure I make them go as far as I
can<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.359> even<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:27.750> inexpensive<00:00:28.380> ones<00:00:28.560> need

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
can but even your inexpensive ones need

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
can but even your inexpensive ones need
to<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.980> divided<00:00:29.670> every<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.269> so

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
to be divided every now and then so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.150 
to be divided every now and then so
we're<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> show<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.320> how<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
we're going to show you how to do that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
we're going to show you how to do that
these<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.640> been<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.059> three<00:00:33.090> years<00:00:33.570> these

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
these have been in for three years these

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.889 
these have been in for three years these
are<00:00:33.960> regular<00:00:34.430> King<00:00:35.430> Alfred's<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:36.059> Carlton<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
are regular King Alfred's or Carlton and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
are regular King Alfred's or Carlton and
so<00:00:37.590> we're<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> divide<00:00:37.980> those<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> show

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so we're going to divide those and show

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
so we're going to divide those and show
you<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.300> okay<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> got<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you how what to do okay first you got to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530 
you how what to do okay first you got to
find<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.520> area<00:00:41.760> we've<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.420> them

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
find them in this area we've got them

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.840 
find them in this area we've got them
fairly<00:00:43.079> densely<00:00:43.410> planted<00:00:43.649> they're<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.670> one

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
fairly densely planted they're on one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
fairly densely planted they're on one
foot<00:00:45.120> centers<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.170> sort<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.350> dig<00:00:46.590> around

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
foot centers you just sort of dig around

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
foot centers you just sort of dig around
to<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.100> find<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:47.579> bulbs<00:00:52.579> there's<00:00:53.579> some<00:00:56.899> try

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
to you find some bulbs there's some try

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.150 
to you find some bulbs there's some try
not<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> cut<00:00:58.410> through<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:59.510> there<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> go

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
not to cut through them there you go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.770 
not to cut through them there you go
so<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:02.550> our<00:01:02.670> bulbs<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.210> I'll<00:01:03.420> show<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so now we got our bulbs up I'll show you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320 
so now we got our bulbs up I'll show you
how<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> divide<00:01:04.260> them<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.970> we've<00:01:06.150> got

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
how to divide them so now that we've got

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
how to divide them so now that we've got
them<00:01:06.450> found<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.290> found<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:07.710> bulbs<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
them found we found our bulbs we kind of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
them found we found our bulbs we kind of
pull<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.860> some<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> them

pull them out like this some of them

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
pull them out like this some of them
bent<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.400> little<00:01:11.430> chopped<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.630> we

see them like this we're going to have

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.100 
see them like this we're going to have
two<00:01:36.500> three<00:01:36.920> five<00:01:37.280> seven<00:01:37.910> or<00:01:38.000> more<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.600> you're

two three five seven or more and you're
going<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.260> have<00:01:39.380> things<00:01:39.650> like<00:01:39.740> that

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
going to have things like that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.560 
going to have things like that
the<00:01:40.370> ones<00:01:40.550> that<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.790> been<00:01:40.910> damaged<00:01:41.390> this

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
the ones that have been damaged this

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.780 
the ones that have been damaged this
isn't<00:01:41.900> bad<00:01:42.110> as<00:01:42.470> long<00:01:42.710> as<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.950> has<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.130> discs<00:01:43.550> at

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
isn't bad as long as it has the discs at

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.969 
isn't bad as long as it has the discs at
the<00:01:43.910> bottom<00:01:44.360> which<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.020> basically<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.680> stem

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the bottom which is basically the stem

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.160 
the bottom which is basically the stem
of<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.190> bulb<00:01:46.460> these<00:01:46.760> are<00:01:46.910> just<00:01:47.060> leaves<00:01:47.390> so

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
of the bulb these are just leaves so

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.750 
of the bulb these are just leaves so
once<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.530> have<00:01:48.619> some<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.430> can

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
once you have some of that you can

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.880 
once you have some of that you can
actually<00:01:50.080> actually<00:01:51.080> practically<00:01:51.590> that's<00:01:51.770> how

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
actually actually practically that's how

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.170 
actually actually practically that's how
they<00:01:52.040> cut<00:01:52.280> them<00:01:52.400> up<00:01:52.520> into<00:01:52.670> little<00:01:52.729> pieces<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
they cut them up into little pieces and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.330 
they cut them up into little pieces and
make<00:01:53.330> more<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.990> then<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:54.890> break<00:01:55.130> these

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
make more and then you just break these

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.210 
make more and then you just break these
up<00:01:55.369> into<00:01:55.640> little<00:01:55.790> scales<00:01:56.270> okay<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.009> these<00:01:58.160> are

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
up into little scales okay so these are

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.950 
up into little scales okay so these are
actually<00:01:58.610> new<00:01:58.790> little<00:01:59.060> daffodil<00:01:59.600> bulbs

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
actually new little daffodil bulbs

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.680 
actually new little daffodil bulbs
starting<00:02:00.350> right<00:02:00.500> here<00:02:00.670> okay<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.450> want<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
starting right here okay so you want to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.359 
starting right here okay so you want to
just<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.350> just<00:02:03.530> plant<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.920> back<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
just you just plant this back in the

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.219 
just you just plant this back in the
ground<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.759> will<00:02:04.820> come<00:02:05.240> up<00:02:05.270> maybe<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:05.869> flower

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
ground it will come up maybe not flower

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.530 
ground it will come up maybe not flower
next<00:02:06.530> year<00:02:06.800> but<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> year<00:02:07.280> after<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.479> if

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
you have really expensive bulbs don't

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
you have really expensive bulbs don't
worry<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:10.160> haven't<00:02:10.280> killed<00:02:10.580> them<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.850> then

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
worry you haven't killed them and then

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.720 
worry you haven't killed them and then
these<00:02:11.600> right<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:12.350> it's<00:02:13.040> nice<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.489> don't<00:02:13.580> have

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
these right here it's nice we don't have

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.370 
these right here it's nice we don't have
any<00:02:13.850> roots<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.239> them<00:02:14.330> yet<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.989> just<00:02:15.050> brush

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380

any roots on them yet and just brush
them<00:02:15.590> off<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.480> now<00:02:17.600> we've<00:02:17.750> got<00:02:17.900> three<00:02:18.260> bulbs

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
them off and now we've got three bulbs

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.110 
them off and now we've got three bulbs
instead<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.010> one<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.340> plant<00:02:19.580> these<00:02:19.730> back<00:02:19.940> in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
instead of one we plant these back in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.180 
instead of one we plant these back in
the<00:02:20.150> ground<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:21.440> get<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> whole<00:02:21.770> little<00:02:21.980> clump

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the ground you get a whole little clump

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.280 
the ground you get a whole little clump
these<00:02:22.730> all<00:02:22.970> came<00:02:23.180> from<00:02:23.360> basically<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.050> same

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
these all came from basically the same

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.160 
these all came from basically the same
hole<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.239> nice<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:26.989> we<00:02:27.050> have

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
hole so it's now nice that now we have

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.199 
hole so it's now nice that now we have
instead<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> one<00:02:28.190> bulb<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.610> was<00:02:28.760> planted

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
instead of one bulb that was planted

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.060 
instead of one bulb that was planted
three<00:02:29.570> years<00:02:29.810> ago<00:02:29.989> we've<00:02:30.140> got<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.500> two<00:02:30.739> three

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
three years ago we've got one two three

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.390 
three years ago we've got one two three
four<00:02:31.370> five<00:02:31.640> six<00:02:32.299> seven<00:02:32.690> eight<00:02:32.989> bulbs<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:34.220> put

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
four five six seven eight bulbs to put

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.550 
four five six seven eight bulbs to put
back<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.850> ground<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.959> that's<00:02:36.110> an<00:02:36.320> eight

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
back in the ground so that's an eight

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.039 
back in the ground so that's an eight
eight<00:02:37.190> hundred<00:02:37.489> percent<00:02:37.790> increase<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.959> if

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
eight hundred percent increase so if

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.300
