00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.240
 primary school pupils

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.860
 to learn to play the head 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 on time you run 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.240
 because when we had to go first 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 before entering to know what is there 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.380
 he pointed out we were excited because 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.180
 There is something new 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.570
 this is the filmed testimony of a 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.879
 essay organized after only 25 lessons 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.980
 at the comprehensive Italian institute 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.800
 calvino di galliate teacher enabled 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.640
 the yamaha and professor methodology 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.740
 paulo caserta the materials that come 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 carried out during our lessons are 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.140
 four games repertoire chords and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 ensemble 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.790
 jogging and heating activity 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.290
 technician at the keyboard 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.490
 thanks to the support of the base 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.490
 this becomes music 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 no 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.610
 the repertoire is the material that allows 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.650
 to learn to recognize and play 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.740
 various melodies with the relative ones 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.580
 accompaniment the melody comes 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.580
 entrusted to the right hand 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.520
 the accompaniment to the left hand 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.390
 the division of the boys into two teams 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.430
 allows achievement of objectives 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.430
 as complex as playing with joined hands 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.069
 which happens later in a way 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.069
 natural 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.910
 the songs must be accompanied 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.640
 by agreements the agreements allow for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.040
 take advantage of keyboard technology and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.090
 thus realizing real ones 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.040
 orchestral accompaniments the use 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.190
 of the bases allows the boys to 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.060
 feeling part of a musical context 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.060
 complete and realistic 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.730
 the ensemble is an activity that can be done 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.590
 play only in groups 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.260
 thanks to the possibility of dividing i 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.000
 boys in sections entrusting them 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.000
 different roles and tim 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.640
 no 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.949
 nothing I have to say that it was 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.020
 a truly positive experience 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.210
 at the beginning, as usual, news 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.580
 there is always a bit of skepticism aside 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.279
 ours, however, the fact when we have 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.620
 seen during the course of the year e 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.189
 path of children learning of 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.400
 children 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.590
 then the master's skill is clear of 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.939
 it also involves everyone and passion 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.099
 that the children put us in 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.319
 we really take ourselves too 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.360
 satisfied with this strong spirit he 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.310
 is the second year that it does and will do so 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.870
 for the third year I am very happy 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.030
 so I find a lot of initiative 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.300
 positive 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.220
 I hope that in the future it can continue e 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.480
 you mattia what you think you liked 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.010
 this course a lot 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.010
 to remit every year
