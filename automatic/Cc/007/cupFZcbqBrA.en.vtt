00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
description personally the second method

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
description personally the second method
isn't<00:00:45.329> my<00:00:45.510> favorite<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.649> enjoy<00:00:46.890> doing

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
isn't my favorite I really enjoy doing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440 
isn't my favorite I really enjoy doing
this<00:00:47.370> method<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.239> much

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
this method because it's just much

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
this method because it's just much
quicker<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> guarantee

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
quicker and you know it's a guarantee

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.430 
quicker and you know it's a guarantee
for<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> heavy<00:00:51.780> pipe<00:00:52.050> I'll<00:00:52.199> leave

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
for you to get the heavy pipe I'll leave

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.959 
for you to get the heavy pipe I'll leave
the<00:00:52.559> second<00:00:52.890> method<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> description<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the second method in the description but

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.250 
the second method in the description but
personally<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> don't<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.930> using<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
personally I don't like using that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
personally I don't like using that
method<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.579> based<00:00:56.879> on

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
method because it's just really based on

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.420 
method because it's just really based on
luck<00:00:57.410> sometimes<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.590> does<00:00:58.739> spawn<00:00:59.010> sometimes

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
luck sometimes it does spawn sometimes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
luck sometimes it does spawn sometimes
the<00:00:59.550> heavy<00:00:59.699> pike<00:00:59.910> doesn't<00:01:00.270> spawn<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the heavy pike doesn't spawn so if you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.049 
the heavy pike doesn't spawn so if you
guys<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.620> happen<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> mission<00:01:02.730> Akal

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

guys do happen to have this mission Akal
rising<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.600> highly<00:01:04.080> recommend<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.979> do

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rising i highly recommend that you do

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
rising i highly recommend that you do
this<00:01:05.460> method<00:01:05.700> instead<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> other<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
this method instead of the other one so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.899 
this method instead of the other one so
once<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.010> finished<00:01:08.189> killing<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> fall

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
once you're finished killing that fall

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.219 
once you're finished killing that fall
and<00:01:08.939> walk<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.200> uh

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and walk here what you want to do is uh

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
and walk here what you want to do is uh
pick<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.860> another<00:01:11.070> pipe<00:01:11.340> most<00:01:11.610> likely<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> one

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
pick up another pipe most likely the one

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
pick up another pipe most likely the one
you've<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.600> used<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.200> damaged<00:01:13.710> so

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you've just used is really damaged so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
you've just used is really damaged so
you<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> pipe<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.210> has<00:01:15.360> full

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you really want a pipe that has full

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.719 
you really want a pipe that has full
health<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.130> happen<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.460> lose

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
health because if you happen to lose

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
keep this heavy pipe in good condition

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
keep this heavy pipe in good condition
so<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> guys<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.390> run

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so what you guys want to do is just run

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.030 
so what you guys want to do is just run
through<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> mission<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.439> guys<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.890> saw

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
through the mission as you guys just saw

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
through the mission as you guys just saw
out<00:01:35.159> there<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.579> try<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> block<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.390> heavy

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
out there they try to block the heavy

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
out there they try to block the heavy
pipes<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> can't<00:01:37.229> drive<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> next

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
pipes so you can't drive it to the next

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.530 
pipes so you can't drive it to the next
part<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.119> mission

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
part of this mission

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630 
part of this mission
but<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.020> found<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.439> another<00:01:40.829> loop<00:01:41.130> around<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
but I found like another loop around it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.740 
but I found like another loop around it
so<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> guys<00:01:42.090> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.479> head<00:01:42.659> up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
should be over to the second part of the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
should be over to the second part of the
mission<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.720> heavy<00:01:48.899> pike<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.680> once<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979

have your heavy pipe over to the second
part<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> mission<00:01:52.259> what<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> guys<00:01:52.890> want

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to do is head up to the cinders and you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
to do is head up to the cinders and you
will<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.869> Scola's<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.759> easy<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
will see Scola's it's really easy to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
will see Scola's it's really easy to
kill<00:01:57.420> him<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> heavy<00:01:57.899> pipe<00:01:58.140> he<00:01:58.500> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
kill him with the heavy pipe he just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.709 
kill him with the heavy pipe he just
goes<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.520> quickly<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.360> use<00:02:00.689> your

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
goes down so quickly so just use your

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
goes down so quickly so just use your
heavy<00:02:01.079> pipe<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.799> simple<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.310> make

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
heavy pipe it's really simple but make

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.190 
heavy pipe it's really simple but make
sure<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.729> keep<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.270> good<00:02:03.299> condition<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
sure to keep it in good condition so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.530 
sure to keep it in good condition so
what<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> guys<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.829> from<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.189> is

to do once you reach the winter his lair
is<00:02:16.910> scarce<00:02:17.210> goal<00:02:17.420> us<00:02:17.570> away<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:18.350> use<00:02:18.530> your

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
is scarce goal us away and then use your

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.590 
is scarce goal us away and then use your
heavy<00:02:18.860> pack<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.280> make<00:02:19.550> your<00:02:19.700> way<00:02:19.820> around<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
heavy pack to make your way around and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.230 
heavy pack to make your way around and
down<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.740> bottom<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> map<00:02:22.580> do<00:02:22.790> not<00:02:22.970> do

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
down to the bottom of the map do not do

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240 
down to the bottom of the map do not do
what<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:23.870> did<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.290> boost<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.190> way

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
what I just did and boost all the way

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.740 
what I just did and boost all the way
down<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.670> was<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.880> big<00:02:26.180> mistake

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
down that was a big mistake

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.140 
down that was a big mistake
I<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:27.440> damaged<00:02:27.830> my<00:02:27.950> pipe<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.580> just<00:02:28.790> didn't

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
I really damaged my pipe I I just didn't

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.720 
I really damaged my pipe I I just didn't
die<00:02:29.270> with<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.170> fire<00:02:30.440> though<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.920> do

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
die with it it's on fire though so do

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.820 
die with it it's on fire though so do
not<00:02:31.880> boost<00:02:32.270> down<00:02:32.510> like<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.870> did<00:02:32.900> try<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.620> find

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
not boost down like I did try to find

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.350 
not boost down like I did try to find
your<00:02:33.950> way<00:02:34.010> around<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.580> map<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.090> don't

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
your way around the map so you don't

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.940 
your way around the map so you don't
happen<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.810> take<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.990> lot<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.230> damage<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.710> your

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
happen to take a lot of damage on your
