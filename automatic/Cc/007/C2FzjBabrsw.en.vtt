what's<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.720> starting<00:00:20.080> point<00:00:20.619> for<00:00:20.860> your

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
what's the starting point for your

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.350 
what's the starting point for your
designs<00:00:21.369> I<00:00:21.759> was<00:00:22.570> talking<00:00:22.990> for<00:00:23.230> my<00:00:23.650> design<00:00:24.070> is

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
designs I was talking for my design is

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
designs I was talking for my design is
in<00:00:25.360> general<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:28.439> yes<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.919> all<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:30.310> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640 

there<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.580> basic<00:00:39.970> rule<00:00:40.120> is<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:40.480> I<00:00:40.780> leave<00:00:41.410> my

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
there is a basic rule is that I leave my

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.130 
there is a basic rule is that I leave my
imagination<00:00:42.490> completely<00:00:42.940> floating<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.720> at

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
imagination completely floating and at

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.350 
imagination completely floating and at
the<00:00:44.260> command<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.920> don't<00:00:45.640> leave<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.880> technique

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
the command I don't leave the technique

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.090 
the command I don't leave the technique
commanding<00:00:46.900> because<00:00:47.290> when<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:47.590> do<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:47.770> drawing

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
commanding because when you do a drawing

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.610 
commanding because when you do a drawing
if<00:00:49.090> you<00:00:49.510> have<00:00:49.750> if<00:00:50.050> you're<00:00:50.200> driven<00:00:50.470> by

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
if you have if you're driven by

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.350 
if you have if you're driven by
techniques<00:00:51.220> there's<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> lot<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.880> things<00:00:52.150> that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
techniques there's a lot of things that

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.630 
techniques there's a lot of things that
you're<00:00:52.540> deciding<00:00:53.080> to<00:00:53.110> not<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.590> do<00:00:53.710> if<00:00:54.160> you<00:00:54.400> stop

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
you're deciding to not to do if you stop

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.720 
you're deciding to not to do if you stop
by<00:00:54.910> this<00:00:54.970> point<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.590> drawing<00:00:57.040> you're<00:00:57.489> never

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
by this point on a drawing you're never

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.770 
by this point on a drawing you're never
sort<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.030> can<00:00:58.300> push<00:00:58.510> boundaries<00:01:00.660> when<00:01:01.660> I'm

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
sort of can push boundaries when I'm

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.210 
sort of can push boundaries when I'm
thinking<00:01:02.350> my<00:01:02.500> design<00:01:02.890> when<00:01:03.100> I'm<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:04.239> them

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
thinking my design when I'm doing them

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.010 
thinking my design when I'm doing them
it<00:01:06.220> barely<00:01:06.490> comes<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.180> fashion<00:01:07.600> world<00:01:07.630> and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
it barely comes in the fashion world and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.350 
it barely comes in the fashion world and
it's<00:01:08.200> definitely<00:01:08.590> not<00:01:08.950> attached<00:01:09.399> to<00:01:09.700> any<00:01:09.940> type

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
it's definitely not attached to any type

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.540 
it's definitely not attached to any type
of<00:01:10.390> clothing<00:01:10.869> that's<00:01:11.290> for<00:01:11.500> sure<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:12.009> see

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
of clothing that's for sure I see

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.660 
of clothing that's for sure I see
something<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.509> in<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.320> head<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:15.190> becomes

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
something that in the head it becomes

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.920 
something that in the head it becomes
she<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:18.220> one<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:19.180> actually<00:01:19.420> really<00:01:19.690> I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
she well this one is actually really I

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.900 
she well this one is actually really I
was<00:01:20.170> thinking<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.680> bridge<00:01:20.920> it's<00:01:21.520> not<00:01:21.729> an

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
was thinking of a bridge it's not an

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.460 
was thinking of a bridge it's not an
inspiration<00:01:22.540> actually<00:01:22.660> it's<00:01:23.020> coming<00:01:23.259> from<00:01:23.410> a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
inspiration actually it's coming from a

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.080 
inspiration actually it's coming from a
souvenir<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.979> just<00:01:24.250> crossed<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:24.640> morning

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
souvenir I just crossed this morning

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.820 
souvenir I just crossed this morning
coming<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.600> Design<00:01:25.869> Museum<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.380> cross<00:01:26.800> that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
coming to the Design Museum I cross that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.620 
coming to the Design Museum I cross that
bridge<00:01:27.190> when<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.520> was<00:01:27.670> looking<00:01:28.000> at<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.210> grid<00:01:28.420> on

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
bridge when I was looking at the grid on

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.499 
bridge when I was looking at the grid on
how<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.930> art<00:01:29.410> was<00:01:29.740> done<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.820> art<00:01:31.060> world

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
how the art was done so the art world

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.109 
how the art was done so the art world
we've<00:01:32.020> had<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.410> big<00:01:32.619> piece<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:33.039> metal<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.670> that

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
we've had a big piece of metal and that

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.029 
we've had a big piece of metal and that
out<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.660> big<00:01:34.869> piece<00:01:35.050> of<00:01:35.229> metal<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:36.009> have

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
out of this big piece of metal you have

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.999 
out of this big piece of metal you have
been<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.700> things<00:01:37.289> symbolizing<00:01:38.289> change<00:01:38.710> so

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
been like things symbolizing change so

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.040 
been like things symbolizing change so
it's<00:01:39.160> basically<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:39.970> sort<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.330> thought<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
it's basically I sort of thought of the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.400 
it's basically I sort of thought of the
bending<00:01:41.619> circle<00:01:42.250> hold<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.720> different<00:01:44.170> type

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
bending circle hold to a different type

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.800 
bending circle hold to a different type
of<00:01:44.440> lines<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.280> it's<00:01:45.580> having<00:01:45.910> a<00:01:46.090> circle<00:01:46.569> and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
of lines so it's having a circle and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.260 
of lines so it's having a circle and
line<00:01:47.440> creating<00:01:48.130> some<00:01:48.369> these<00:01:48.610> shapes<00:01:48.910> all<00:01:49.149> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
line creating some these shapes all the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.130 
line creating some these shapes all the
time<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.880> comes<00:01:52.179> from<00:01:52.390> an<00:01:52.539> element<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.020> I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
time that comes from an element that I

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.919 
time that comes from an element that I
have<00:01:53.410> in<00:01:53.530> mind<00:01:53.770> if<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.099> comes<00:01:54.369> from<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.970> detail

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
have in mind if it comes from a detail

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.260 
have in mind if it comes from a detail
of<00:01:55.959> the<00:01:56.229> textile<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.280> piece<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.670> an<00:01:57.789> object

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
of the textile of a piece of an object

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.350 
of the textile of a piece of an object
it<00:01:58.630> can<00:01:58.869> come<00:01:59.080> with<00:01:59.259> color<00:01:59.560> I<00:02:00.209> always<00:02:01.209> love

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
it can come with color I always love

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.010 
it can come with color I always love
colors<00:02:01.709> when<00:02:02.709> I<00:02:02.740> was<00:02:02.979> at<00:02:03.160> school<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:04.840> called
