stages and uh 21 were empty so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
stages and uh 21 were empty so
potentially<00:01:55.710> we're<00:01:56.070> looking<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.369> 24<00:01:56.759> playable

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
this game now this again we could very

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.070 
this game now this again we could very
well<00:02:44.730> change<00:02:44.820> with<00:02:45.300> still<00:02:45.540> very<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:45.750> early

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
well change with still very very early

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.540 
well change with still very very early
stages<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.470> development<00:02:46.830> games<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.400> don't

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
stages of development games we don't

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.130 
stages of development games we don't
really<00:02:47.640> really<00:02:47.880> know<00:02:48.060> but<00:02:48.570> based<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.080> what

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
really really know but based on what

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.990 
really really know but based on what
this<00:02:49.500> guy<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:50.190> developer<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.640> telling<00:02:50.910> us

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
this guy this developer is telling us

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.880 
this guy this developer is telling us
this<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> dragon<00:02:51.870> ball<00:02:52.080> z<00:02:52.260> game<00:02:52.290> which

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
this is a dragon ball z game which

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.920 
this is a dragon ball z game which
confirms<00:02:53.310> no<00:02:53.490> GT<00:02:53.730> characters<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.720> will

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
confirms no GT characters but it will

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.540 
confirms no GT characters but it will
have<00:02:55.200> movie<00:02:55.590> characters<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> special

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
have movie characters and special

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.520 
have movie characters and special
characters<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.540> guess<00:02:57.720> what<00:02:57.900> was<00:02:57.990> supposed

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
characters and I guess what was supposed

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.550 
characters and I guess what was supposed
to<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.860> once<00:02:59.460> more<00:02:59.790> fish<00:03:00.180> comes<00:03:00.450> out<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to you once more fish comes out and the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.160 
to you once more fish comes out and the
development<00:03:02.490> continues<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.330> young<00:03:03.570> service

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
development continues so young service
