00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
chance I will see bench and I always

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.740 
chance I will see bench and I always
have<00:03:06.060> more<00:03:06.299> chance<00:03:06.629> to<00:03:07.409> get<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> call<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.129> wall

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
away from the front of ground so in this

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.789 
away from the front of ground so in this
case<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.019> monkey<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> roller

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
case you if you monkey you a roller

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.890 
case you if you monkey you a roller
lower<00:03:38.129> and<00:03:38.549> at<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> top<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.720> higher

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
lower and at the top of the higher

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.250 
lower and at the top of the higher
you've<00:03:40.319> got<00:03:40.919> a<00:03:40.949> more<00:03:41.310> stable<00:03:41.579> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.819> track

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
you've got a more stable on the track

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.720 
you've got a more stable on the track
and<00:03:43.260> abettor<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:45.379> school<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
maximum school you can have power like a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.539 
maximum school you can have power like a
Saudi<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> millimeter<00:03:51.709> but<00:03:52.709> uh<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.400> to

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
Saudi a millimeter but uh you have to

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.819 
Saudi a millimeter but uh you have to
think<00:03:53.760> about<00:03:53.879> it<00:03:54.180> you're<00:03:54.840> gonna<00:03:55.109> have<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.590> nut

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
think about it you're gonna have the nut

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.229 
think about it you're gonna have the nut
and<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.220> top<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.699> the<00:03:56.790> bottom<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:59.239> detect

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
and the top and the bottom so detect

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.089 
and the top and the bottom so detect
that<00:04:00.419> part<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.019> only<00:04:01.169> probably<00:04:01.709> only<00:04:01.829> have

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
that part you only probably only have

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.589 
that part you only probably only have
like<00:04:02.280> thirty<00:04:02.549> five<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:03.060> thirty<00:04:03.299> three

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
like thirty five to thirty three

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.409 
like thirty five to thirty three
millimeters<00:04:04.109> high<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:05.060> also<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.739> see

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
millimeters high and also you can see

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.949 
millimeters high and also you can see
because<00:04:09.419> that<00:04:10.790> right<00:04:11.790> here<00:04:12.060> because<00:04:12.659> that

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
because that right here because that

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.149 
because that right here because that
little<00:04:13.139> Singh<00:04:13.560> stick<00:04:13.859> out<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.419> to

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
little Singh stick out so you have to

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.009 
little Singh stick out so you have to
consider<00:04:17.159> that<00:04:17.549> part<00:04:17.909> only<00:04:18.090> can<00:04:18.479> go<00:04:18.720> like<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
consider that part only can go like a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.690 
consider that part only can go like a
two<00:04:19.229> millimeter<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:20.220> then<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:22.340> roller<00:04:23.340> right

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
two millimeter and then the roller right

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.970 
two millimeter and then the roller right
he<00:04:23.940> only<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:24.479> go<00:04:24.630> formula<00:04:25.110> winner

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
he only can go formula winner

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.380 
he only can go formula winner
away<00:04:26.250> from<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.610> ground<00:04:26.790> so<00:04:27.210> it's<00:04:28.050> pretty<00:04:28.590> much

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
away from the ground so it's pretty much

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.540 
away from the ground so it's pretty much
this<00:04:30.390> standard<00:04:31.260> sitting<00:04:31.710> with<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> schools

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
this standard sitting with the schools

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.690 
this standard sitting with the schools
has<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.880> lotta<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.420> disadvantage<00:04:34.400> but<00:04:35.400> as<00:04:35.550> you

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
has a lotta a disadvantage but as you

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.090 
has a lotta a disadvantage but as you
can<00:04:35.850> see<00:04:35.910> who<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> motor<00:04:36.600> shaft<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.830> can

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
can see who is the motor shaft you can

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.550 
can see who is the motor shaft you can
mung<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> whatever<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.880> want<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.080> can<00:04:40.260> go

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
mung the whatever you want so you can go

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.110 
mung the whatever you want so you can go
all<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.040> way<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:43.380> lowest<00:04:43.830> two<00:04:44.670> millimeter

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
all the way the lowest two millimeter

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.050 
all the way the lowest two millimeter
even<00:04:45.810> one<00:04:46.050> meter<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.620> want<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.060> to

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
even one meter but if you want you to

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.610 
even one meter but if you want you to
away<00:04:48.360> from<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.690> ground<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.170> have<00:04:49.350> more

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
away from the ground so you have more

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.420 
away from the ground so you have more
advantage<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:51.510> mung<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.050> your<00:04:52.170> lower<00:04:52.440> lower<00:04:52.920> or

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
advantage to mung to your lower lower or

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.000 
advantage to mung to your lower lower or
you<00:04:53.820> go<00:04:54.150> higher<00:04:54.570> on<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.470> top<00:04:57.140> okay<00:04:58.140> for<00:04:58.920> my

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
you go higher on the top okay for my

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.010 
you go higher on the top okay for my
next<00:04:59.040> video<00:05:00.140> I<00:05:01.280> gonna<00:05:02.280> talk<00:05:02.520> about<00:05:02.580> how<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.300> do

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
next video I gonna talk about how to do

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.970 
next video I gonna talk about how to do
the<00:05:04.200> setup<00:05:05.000> with<00:05:06.000> motor<00:05:06.270> shaft<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.990> gonna<00:05:07.770> give

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
the setup with motor shaft I gonna give
