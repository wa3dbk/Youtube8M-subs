00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:12.509
 a new video tutorial on how to turn on 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.530
 your tablets look if they do not have the button 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.529
 to lock off or turn on the 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.670
 tablet or screen as they see fear 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.939
 has already this very easy let's look 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.130
 our plug is plugged in already 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.519
 you connect it where the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519
 tablet 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.050
 and if we stop it plugged in, what 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 What is going to happen 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.910
 the tablet turns on but what happens to the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.949
 wait and start loading what 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.020
 have to do is unplug the up 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.840
 that the bacteria goes out and now what 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:59.900
 you have to do is do the following 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.900
 keep connect still not 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.330
 counted one two three four five what 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.330
 we take out and we wait 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.390
 it is spreading 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.770
 and as we can see our tablet is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.689
 turning on and in that case if they do not know 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 when was the last time they compared it 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.180
 as cargo qe2 just in case they come back to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.680
 do it and there it will happen 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 look what we have 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.580
 let's wait a little 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 but let's go 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.960
 this is a tablet as we can see 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.420
 nucleus 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.880
 the nucleus we will see 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.450
 my tablet comes what is 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 is 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.540
 an 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.710
 to percent successfully and I want I do not know 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.500
 if you are 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.060
 when he is learning and the tiger nut if he 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.040
 it turns them off 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.350
 it's because the tablet is being downloaded 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.140
 the 37 of the goddess but they are charged 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.790
 we call time disconnects and then 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.260
 try again like I said and wait 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.320
 five seconds like that 1 2 3 4 5 disconnects 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.450
