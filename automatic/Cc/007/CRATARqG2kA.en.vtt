00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.159
 behind right 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.260
 then it is possible that neither 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.659
 everything in the game will translate some items 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.460
 because it is not translated because of 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.340
 updates I always say more 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.030

 good even if the translator is in Portuguese 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:40.330
 not everything was brought from the Portuguese right 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:46.060
 things in English as nurseries in 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:48.430
 English is in English 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.500
 the description of the items in English or 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.520
 all items treatment films 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.760
 translated 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.720
 some only have a title translated and 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:10.510
 who serves Korean excited to give 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:12.250
 to play understand good title 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.920
 all of which were not 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:20.580
 translated 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:25.020
 It's like the translator two months ago. 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.280
 and MPC and emissions have to enter a 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.430
 two months have not been 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.170
 logically translated but can not really 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.560
 play the title here well this is translated 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:43.150
 in creches where translating the title is the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.730
 npc tite came to know the place where 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.480
 You have to perform quest and aim. 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.880
 in the case here at Christmas with his mother 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:06:01.470
 the description helps in this question has everything 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:05.680
 Korean is the name of cnpc it is translated to 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.150
 behind the English will translate the 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.150
 only things that in Portuguese were 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:14.470
 when you move map that tip 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.450
 that appears when you enter the 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.780
 portal points the map that tip appears 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:26.790
 stay behind the Portuguese is this here 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:30.870
 It is also the one I take to stop following 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.040
 to change mon 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.830

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:40.210
 translate what has been translated into this 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:45.120

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.120
 English also with 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.150
 the disputes in this case 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.240
 from adcap so much that the name comes out from above 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.970
 well then is that behind the taxi was 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.680
 entered is not fully translated from the 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:14.440
