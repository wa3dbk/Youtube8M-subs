00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
thought the show was actually good I

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.060 
thought the show was actually good I
thought<00:01:17.670> last<00:01:17.970> night<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.360> Raw<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.780> saw<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.070> vast

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
thought last night on Raw we saw a vast

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
thought last night on Raw we saw a vast
improvement<00:01:20.340> over<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.600> last<00:01:21.840> several<00:01:22.200> weeks

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
improvement over the last several weeks

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
improvement over the last several weeks
of<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.860> day<00:01:22.950> Night<00:01:23.100> Raw<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
of one day Night Raw you see when you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789 
of one day Night Raw you see when you
know<00:01:24.390> even<00:01:24.630> though<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.650> all

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
know even though you know there was all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.320 
know even though you know there was all
these<00:01:25.890> rewrites<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.430> everything<00:01:26.820> okay<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
these rewrites and everything okay I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670 
these rewrites and everything okay I
thought<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> full<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.290> show<00:01:28.530> was

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
thought the full to the show was

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
thought the full to the show was
actually<00:01:28.979> pretty<00:01:29.100> good<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> thought<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
actually pretty good I thought it was a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
actually pretty good I thought it was a
consistent<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.840> last<00:01:31.049> night

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
consistent is I think I think last night

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.539 
consistent is I think I think last night
rod<00:01:31.560> did<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> lot<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> things<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.189> made<00:01:32.369> sense

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
rod did a lot of things that made sense

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
rod did a lot of things that made sense
because<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> didn't<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> damn<00:01:33.689> animal

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because we didn't have the damn animal

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170 
because we didn't have the damn animal
plan<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.619> didn't<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> bunch<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.490> uh<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
plan we didn't have a bunch of uh you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.700 
plan we didn't have a bunch of uh you
know<00:01:36.210> bunnies<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.200> didn't<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> bunch

that but even though the show was
rewritten<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:50.530> goes<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.709> show<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:51.040> that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.380 
but I really thought last night raw did
a<00:03:05.740> good<00:03:05.860> job<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.280> developing<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.790> storylines

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
a good job in developing the storylines

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.780 
a good job in developing the storylines
and<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> matches<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.590> helmets<00:03:08.920> ll<00:03:09.280> be<00:03:09.459> it's<00:03:09.700> a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.880 
and the matches for helmets ll be it's a
little<00:03:10.000> too<00:03:10.180> late<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:10.600> I'm<00:03:11.020> nearly<00:03:11.440> got<00:03:11.680> one

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
little too late now I'm nearly got one

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650

again<00:03:36.190> well<00:03:36.880> even<00:03:37.239> Big<00:03:37.420> Show<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.750> rusev<00:03:37.900> had<00:03:38.170> a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
again well even Big Show and rusev had a

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.810 
again well even Big Show and rusev had a
very<00:03:38.620> good<00:03:38.709> match<00:03:39.040> i<00:03:39.310> thought<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.610> was<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.730> very

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
very good match i thought it was a very

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.610 
very good match i thought it was a very
compelling<00:03:40.300> match<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.989> was<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> lot<00:03:41.410> better

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
compelling match it was a lot better

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.960 
compelling match it was a lot better
than<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> lot<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.130> people<00:03:42.220> gave<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.670> credit<00:03:42.760> for

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
I think Big Show Rousseff pulled out all

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.979 
I think Big Show Rousseff pulled out all
the<00:03:45.340> stops<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.970> was<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.239> unstoppable<00:03:46.750> force

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
the stops it was the unstoppable force

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
think it was worse did you think was one

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.810

of<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.440> restaurants<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:56.980> year<00:03:57.220> like<00:03:57.700> I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
of the restaurants of the year like I

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.250 
of the restaurants of the year like I
said<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.030> think<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.299> WWE<00:03:58.840> actually<00:03:59.080> bounced

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
said I think the WWE actually bounced

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.720 
said I think the WWE actually bounced
back<00:03:59.440> with<00:03:59.500> this<00:03:59.739> robot<00:04:00.010> which<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.519> I'm

back with this robot which is I'm

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.970 
back with this robot which is I'm
surprising<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:02.290> see<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.980> WWE<00:04:04.980> reread

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
surprising to see that the WWE reread

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.560 
surprising to see that the WWE reread
this<00:04:06.100> raw<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.489> many<00:04:06.640> times<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.239> was<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.450> the
