00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.190
 the renovation of the roosevelt square in the center 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.830
 de são paulo changed the face of a local 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.139
 formerly degraded and abandoned 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.590
 now the square taken every day and 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.269
 adult children skaters 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.760
 look into the future the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.630
 goers that even more improvements 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.970
 and some rules for use of space there 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 30 years old henrique from the window 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.289
 of the Roosevelt Square in the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.090
 center of são paulo that was reinaugurada 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 on the last day 29 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.510
 the high space is beautiful but second 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.120
 he left something to be desired in some respects 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.219
 what I wanted a place that could be is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 the room all over the world 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.670
 unfortunately today's been busy 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.070
 practically by the skaters have to be 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.890
 resolved specific issues for example 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 determine one of a space for the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.969
 described have elderly people who do not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 can cross the public square were 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.760
 hit by the skateboard neighbor andré 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.189
 also points to problems in the reform of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.729
 square that took two years to stay 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.510
 ready and consumed 55 million Brazilian reais 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.220
 town hall 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.350
 the issue of affordability is a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 who can take a walk on the cobblestone square 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.909
 of 60 cents with several trees in the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.740
 no one passes by 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.330
 old gentlemen and gentlemen 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.840
 It's not difficult for us old ladies or 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.390
 the question of the noise of the skaters who 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.970
 day or night the scene repeats the new 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.240
 russia saw is dominated by bicycles 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.150
 skates that appear on high 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.700
 speed from all sides there are grills and 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.190
 broken posts also this here is the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.230
 rua guimarães rosa that is well posted 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.600
 here the square and the question of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.550
 accessibility how does a chair 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.370
 wheels to pass in such a small space 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.380
 the already narrow road to any 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.780
 person now who has any 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.040
 difficulty walking or even walking 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.470
 Wheelchair 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 can hardly climb a 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.530
 ramp so steep to get on the square in 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.399
 street parking and access to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.800
 wheelchairs finish with a ladder in the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 playground has fences as well as 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.790
 space for dogs 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.820
 The challenge is to make everyone 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.459
 use the square securely with a 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.459
 convivial harmony so the locals 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.470
 held a meeting and established 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.250
 commissions and even with the participation 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.250
 skaters to resolve the matter not 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.660
 only of the noise but mainly of the use 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.450
 of public space in the square area 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.510
 the area next to there church consolation 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.690
 and consolation street to be received 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.680
 by the PTs on Tuesday we have at the meeting 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.120
 with the mayor he already knows notes and 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.850
 demands of what we want to renew 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.350
 to separate this area into the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.530
 for the people and for the people 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.280
 share but the controversy seems far away 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 of the end 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.940
 the space reserved for cable that will never 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.250
 have the staff continue to invade 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.930
 whether or not you have a space that is 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.570
 leaving ends up being very compact a lot 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.480
 small skateboard culture does not have much 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.250
 Where it does not work then it ends up here 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.530
 I have no other place, said a 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.800
 problem but the idea ensures the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.420
 residents is that the square belongs to everyone 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.910
 we want to have programs here from the exercise 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.730
 chess workshops to do different 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.580
 Thinking things from agriculture to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.910
 the forces plant this square you give 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.910
 common
