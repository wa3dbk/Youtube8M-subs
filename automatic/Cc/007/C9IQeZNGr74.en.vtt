00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
of the anvils falling and like I said

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.870 
of the anvils falling and like I said
this<00:01:48.160> will<00:01:48.310> not<00:01:48.490> ever

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
this will not ever

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.400 
this will not ever
this<00:01:49.240> hasn't<00:01:49.450> crashed<00:01:49.810> me<00:01:50.020> yet<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.320> I've

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
this hasn't crashed me yet and I've

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.830 
this hasn't crashed me yet and I've
watched<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:50.980> for<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.280> long<00:01:51.580> long<00:01:52.270> time

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840

to<00:03:42.210> even<00:03:42.570> higher<00:03:43.140> up<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.800> naturally<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:44.910> did

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
to even higher up so naturally what did

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.500 
to even higher up so naturally what did
I<00:03:45.120> do

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
I do

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.780 
I do
I<00:03:45.750> doubled<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.440> again<00:03:46.770> an<00:03:46.950> hour<00:03:47.070> up<00:03:47.250> 20<00:03:47.610> blocks

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
I doubled it again an hour up 20 blocks

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.810 
I doubled it again an hour up 20 blocks
so<00:03:48.090> I'm<00:03:48.330> hoping<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:48.930> some<00:03:49.200> good<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.820> good

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
so I'm hoping to get some good a good

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:59.510 
so I'm hoping to get some good a good
view<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.860> now<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.310> kind<00:03:59.490> of

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
view of it and it can now it's kind of

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.410 
view of it and it can now it's kind of
more<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.850> curve<00:04:00.120> thing<00:04:00.360> says<00:04:00.570> my<00:04:00.720> frame

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.590 

and<00:04:03.569> just<00:04:04.260> look<00:04:04.500> at<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:05.090> looks<00:04:06.090> really<00:04:06.360> cool

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
and just look at that looks really cool

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.199 
and just look at that looks really cool
from<00:04:06.780> down<00:04:06.870> here<00:04:07.020> let's<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.410> try<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> beat<00:04:07.860> it

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
from down here let's just try to beat it

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.820 
from down here let's just try to beat it
anywhere<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:09.450> he<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.750> look<00:04:09.870> straight<00:04:10.050> up<00:04:10.260> it

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
anywhere so he just look straight up it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:18.949 
anywhere so he just look straight up it
creates<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.310> vertical<00:04:11.819> line<00:04:11.850> whichever<00:04:17.959> now

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
creates this vertical line whichever now

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.159 
creates this vertical line whichever now
I<00:04:18.989> made<00:04:19.200> an<00:04:19.320> irregularity<00:04:20.780> doing<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.930> made

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
I made an irregularity doing that made

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.030 
I made an irregularity doing that made
it<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.560> little<00:04:23.040> bit<00:04:23.130> weird<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:25.560> yeah<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:25.919> has

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
it a little bit weird so yeah this has

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.880 
it a little bit weird so yeah this has
been<00:04:26.070> falling<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.000> those<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:28.140> FPS

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
been falling and those and the FPS

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.040 
been falling and those and the FPS
appears<00:04:29.610> surprisingly<00:04:30.120> not<00:04:30.300> as<00:04:30.510> bad<00:04:30.780> as<00:04:30.960> it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
appears surprisingly not as bad as it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.409 
appears surprisingly not as bad as it
was<00:04:31.080> before<00:04:31.970> well<00:04:32.970> there's<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.210> other<00:04:33.270> way

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
was before well there's the other way

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.790 
was before well there's the other way
second<00:04:33.780> see<00:04:33.930> how<00:04:33.990> bad<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.169> will<00:04:34.350> get<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:34.680> at

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
second see how bad it will get it's at

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.110 
second see how bad it will get it's at
14<00:04:35.370> 13<00:04:36.180> 14<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:41.070> going<00:04:41.250> down<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.550> 12<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:41.970> it's

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
14 13 14 so going down to 12 so it's

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.720 
14 13 14 so going down to 12 so it's
slowly<00:04:42.419> going<00:04:42.780> down

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.450 

of<00:04:47.730> course<00:04:47.910> my<00:04:48.060> view<00:04:48.360> range<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.310> zero<00:04:52.460> if

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
of course my view range is like zero if

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.400 
of course my view range is like zero if
we<00:04:53.580> look<00:04:53.760> at<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.030> destruction<00:04:54.540> they<00:04:55.020> are<00:04:55.140> all

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
we look at the destruction they are all

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.050 
we look at the destruction they are all
damaged<00:04:55.919> this<00:04:56.070> time<00:04:56.340> it's<00:04:56.550> not<00:04:56.640> just<00:04:56.880> some<00:04:57.030> of

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
damaged this time it's not just some of

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.960 
damaged this time it's not just some of
them<00:04:57.290> so<00:04:58.290> anyway<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.160> has<00:04:59.370> been<00:04:59.580> falling

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
them so anyway this has been falling

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.390 
them so anyway this has been falling
anvils<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:01.020> basically<00:05:01.890> what<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.160> does<00:05:02.280> is

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
anvils and basically what it does is

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.670 
anvils and basically what it does is
just<00:05:02.550> destroys<00:05:02.940> your<00:05:03.150> FPS<00:05:03.440> we're<00:05:04.440> gonna<00:05:04.530> go

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
just destroys your FPS we're gonna go

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.680 
just destroys your FPS we're gonna go
back<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.040> way<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.520> both<00:05:06.000> only<00:05:06.450> when<00:05:06.570> you're

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
back this way and both only when you're

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.140 
back this way and both only when you're
looking<00:05:06.960> at<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.230> see<00:05:07.860> if<00:05:08.100> I<00:05:08.880> get<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.060> little

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
looking at it see if I get a little

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:18.670 
looking at it see if I get a little
closer<00:05:09.740> sorry<00:05:13.580> okay<00:05:14.580> 16<00:05:15.030> FPS<00:05:15.360> 30<00:05:16.280> 2530

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
closer sorry okay 16 FPS 30 2530

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.950 
closer sorry okay 16 FPS 30 2530
actually<00:05:19.680> 60<00:05:20.160> so<00:05:20.610> yeah<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:21.479> really<00:05:21.570> extends
