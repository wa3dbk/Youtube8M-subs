00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.310
 ah 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.569
 Y 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.840
 has been given in the final preparation is a 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.840
 day 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.920
 Where do I begin 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.170
 but we talk 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.539
 I think that is precisely why 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.450
 because you do not risk one hundred percent 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.640
 in the second you are looking 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.120
 and you start looking for the limit then 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.430
 when 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.000
 when the master of the mallet comes to you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 and I would like 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.699
 let's say family and now, nothing with 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.510
 the rush to train and I'm that guy 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.530
 from the morning 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 There is a new day 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.800
 that entering punctually I am very tired 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.800
 but well this is what has 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 and for those days there are only 23 weeks left 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 of this volume 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.720
 is so so so so so so so healthy 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.510
 as you can see 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.470
 I have a real stilt 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.960
 despite the discomfort of pain 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.260
 in spite of all dust we are going to take it out 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.260
 forward 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.280
 yes 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.370
 fundamentally I believe that the first 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.570
 step for a good recovery is a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.040
 humanity 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.120
 only the shooting immediately and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.120
 put something in the body
