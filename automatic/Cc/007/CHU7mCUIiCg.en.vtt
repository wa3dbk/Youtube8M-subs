 ml of warm milk that I put

 within this fee in my opinion 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:53.679
 beautiful with nightmares then a sachet of 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:01:00.920
 I am a master baker here 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:05.239

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.719
 and 60 g of butter is a new for 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.549
 brush inside 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:15.350
 I have already put the milk in the kneader 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:22.159
 the dog and sugar 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:29.240
 now I'm going to put the flour I go to 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:33.189
 put the soft butter pieces and the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.189
 yeast and start the machine 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.810
 then here is our a meal is 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.520
 ready then you realize that the dough 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.229
 it is ready when it is well blended 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.109
 when it comes off the edges 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.759
 of the kneader now let's go and get it 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.579
 the dough we are going to put in one 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.599
 lightly floured bowl and lo 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:13.510
 let's put the oven off with the 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:17.720
 light on to leaven for two hours 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.090
 the two hours of leavening passed 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:27.129
 let's take back our dough here 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:29.959
 let's remove the film here 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:34.329
 we are going to transfer the dough on a 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.329
 floor with lightly floured blackberry 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.459
 at this point we are going to take 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.670
 the dough and let's divide it into two 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.519
 in two parts then in half now we go to 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.519
 take one of the two parts and the 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.250
 let's go and hang out and create 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.920
 a kind of circle itself 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.870
 let's go with the other one once 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.870
 we have our own dough giving it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.590
 a kind of circle shape lo 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.090
 let's divide horizontally and in 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.250
 vertical 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.319
 now once we get these we say 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.230
 these four parts these four 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.230
 he calls it split into two 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.200
 once we get 8 parts we go to 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.940
 divide these eight parts again 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.940
 up to keep the 16 segments 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.400
 once we get our 16 parts there 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.340
 let's go and get there we go we go 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.280
 to form the shape of the croissant starting 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.800
 from the widest part of ours 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.350
 slice we go to roll up to 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.990
 get to the tip and then we go to 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.200
 explain the end slightly so 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.860
 to do a little croissant type e 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.480
 we are going to place them on a baking sheet from 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.200
 oven lined with baking paper 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.680
 let's avoid the inside of the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:18.930
 oven with the light on for another 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.890
 oretta I spent an hour we take the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:28.020
 our cornettini and we make brush 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:34.530
 with on the surface with man and then 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:37.770
 let's bake at 200 degrees for 12 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.230
 15 minutes I wanted to tell you that you can 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.550
 choose you the size of the gods 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.550
 your cornetti for example I have made 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.180
 of larger and smaller then 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.530
 shelters and sizes so you can 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.750
 then decide whether to make them large or small 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.830
 here are our salty cornettini are 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.800

 stuffed with salami and salad 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.920
 as you can see they are very much 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.690
