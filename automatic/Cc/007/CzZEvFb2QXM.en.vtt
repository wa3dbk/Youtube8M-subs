stalkers I got my second base at my

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.060 
stalkers I got my second base at my
natural<00:02:43.040> going<00:02:43.280> up<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:44.110> lot<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.140> times<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.740> try<00:02:46.040> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
natural going up a lot of times I try to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.970 
natural going up a lot of times I try to
do<00:02:46.280> hidden<00:02:46.730> basis<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:48.290> sometimes<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:48.920> just

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
do hidden basis but sometimes I just

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.150 
do hidden basis but sometimes I just
feel<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.490> being<00:02:50.290> right<00:02:51.290> beside<00:02:51.709> my<00:02:52.600> family

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
feel like being right beside my family

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.800 
feel like being right beside my family
alright<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.550> got<00:02:55.580> my<00:02:55.820> wrote<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.270> going<00:02:56.660> up

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
alright so I got my wrote for going up

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.810 
alright so I got my wrote for going up
it's<00:02:57.650> almost<00:02:57.860> done<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.790> my<00:02:59.690> lair<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.950> also

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
it's almost done and my lair is also

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.040 
it's almost done and my lair is also
being<00:03:02.709> uploaded<00:03:04.150> all<00:03:05.150> right<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:05.480> he<00:03:05.660> has<00:03:05.750> just

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
being uploaded all right so he has just

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.470 
being uploaded all right so he has just
gotten<00:03:06.940> his

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.440 

base<00:03:12.629> once<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.319> called<00:03:13.970> what's<00:03:14.970> their<00:03:15.180> baseball

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
base once I called what's their baseball

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.839 
base once I called what's their baseball
oh<00:03:16.159> so<00:03:17.159> he's<00:03:17.310> got<00:03:17.489> his<00:03:17.610> nexus<00:03:17.970> going<00:03:18.239> up<00:03:18.360> and

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
oh so he's got his nexus going up and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.130 
oh so he's got his nexus going up and
let's<00:03:20.849> see<00:03:21.000> if<00:03:21.030> i'll<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.239> able<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.720> kill<00:03:21.900> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.530 

we've<00:03:25.140> got<00:03:25.379> four<00:03:26.330> stalkers<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:29.180> century<00:03:30.180> I

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
we've got four stalkers and century I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.229 
we've got four stalkers and century I
was<00:03:31.049> luckily<00:03:31.290> able<00:03:31.739> enough<00:03:32.069> well<00:03:32.610> luckily<00:03:33.000> I

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
was luckily able enough well luckily I

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.420 
was luckily able enough well luckily I
was<00:03:33.629> fast<00:03:34.200> enough<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.709> kill<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.400> my

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
was fast enough to kill it with my

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.330 
was fast enough to kill it with my
ceiling<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.120> then<00:03:36.360> quickly<00:03:36.540> run<00:03:36.870> back<00:03:37.049> home

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
ceiling and then quickly run back home

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.490 
ceiling and then quickly run back home
alright<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.489> got<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.849> queens<00:03:39.120> at<00:03:39.349> one<00:03:40.349> at

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
alright so I got to queens at one at

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.619 
alright so I got to queens at one at
each<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.860> my<00:03:40.950> bases<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.610> I'm<00:03:42.510> producing<00:03:42.989> seven

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
each of my bases and I'm producing seven

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.410 
each of my bases and I'm producing seven
roaches<00:03:45.629> a<00:03:45.900> hydrilla<00:03:46.860> stem<00:03:47.160> cuz<00:03:47.879> my<00:03:48.030> guess<00:03:48.239> is

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
roaches a hydrilla stem cuz my guess is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.690 
roaches a hydrilla stem cuz my guess is
always<00:03:49.349> might<00:03:50.069> as<00:03:50.129> well<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.370> prepare<00:03:50.670> for

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
always might as well just prepare for

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.059 
always might as well just prepare for
void<00:03:50.940> rays<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.420> she<00:03:51.660> actually<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.349> doing<00:03:52.859> he

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
void rays but she actually is doing he

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.280 
void rays but she actually is doing he
is<00:03:53.099> making<00:03:53.459> some<00:03:53.760> void<00:03:53.970> ways<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.420> it's<00:03:55.140> good

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
is making some void ways so it's good

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.670 
is making some void ways so it's good
thing<00:03:55.440> I'm<00:03:55.560> prepared<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:57.379> so<00:03:58.379> I'm<00:03:58.560> just

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
thing I'm prepared for that so I'm just

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.410 
thing I'm prepared for that so I'm just
going<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.890> ball<00:03:59.040> up<00:03:59.069> my<00:03:59.280> army<00:03:59.609> right<00:03:59.790> up<00:03:59.910> side

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
going to ball up my army right up side

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.339 
going to ball up my army right up side
my<00:04:00.660> natural<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:02.599> because<00:04:03.599> those<00:04:03.780> guys<00:04:04.049> can't

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
my natural and because those guys can't

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.800 
my natural and because those guys can't
really<00:04:04.650> do<00:04:04.950> too<00:04:05.220> much<00:04:05.459> against<00:04:05.910> air<00:04:06.150> what<00:04:06.750> do

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
really do too much against air what do

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.319 
really do too much against air what do
they<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.079> can't<00:04:07.349> do<00:04:07.470> anything<00:04:07.530> at<00:04:07.890> all

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
they really can't do anything at all

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.339 
they really can't do anything at all
alright<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.569> really<00:04:09.930> should<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.140> some

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
alright so I really should have some

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.400 
alright so I really should have some
people<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.819> second<00:04:12.239> gas<00:04:12.420> here<00:04:12.840> but<00:04:13.230> I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
people on this the second gas here but I

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.379 
people on this the second gas here but I
don't<00:04:13.819> budge<00:04:14.819> Leo<00:04:15.120> happen<00:04:15.540> for<00:04:15.810> sure<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:17.389> here

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
don't budge Leo happen for sure and here

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.640 
don't budge Leo happen for sure and here
we<00:04:18.630> have<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.970> void<00:04:21.239> ray<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:21.690> far<00:04:21.930> with<00:04:22.139> one<00:04:22.410> more

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
we have to void ray so far with one more

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.820 
we have to void ray so far with one more
being<00:04:22.830> produced

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
being produced

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.010 
being produced
and<00:04:25.830> he's<00:04:26.190> got<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:26.610> stalkers<00:04:26.970> two<00:04:27.750> centuries

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
and he's got for stalkers two centuries

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.450 
and he's got for stalkers two centuries
and<00:04:28.610> three<00:04:29.610> zealots<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.810> there's<00:04:31.740> my<00:04:31.950> sneaky

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460

and three zealots and there's my sneaky
zealot<00:04:32.790> just<00:04:33.060> hanging<00:04:33.390> out<00:04:33.510> seeing<00:04:34.500> what<00:04:34.560> he's

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
zealot just hanging out seeing what he's

doing very conspicuous and here comes
his<00:04:38.250> three<00:04:38.580> void<00:04:38.790> rays<00:04:39.060> oh<00:04:39.360> no<00:04:41.600> connect<00:04:42.600> me

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
his three void rays oh no connect me

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.490 
his three void rays oh no connect me
Hydra<00:04:43.110> handle<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.670> Queen

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
Hydra handle it the Queen

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
not quite but really two modules come

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.770 
not quite but really two modules come
out<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.290> save<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.800> day<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:50.330> probably<00:04:50.630> right

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
out to save the day so probably right

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.890 
out to save the day so probably right
now<00:04:50.900> yep<00:04:51.200> I'm<00:04:51.380> getting<00:04:51.770> for<00:04:51.980> hydros<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.940> defend

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
now yep I'm getting for hydros to defend

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.060 
now yep I'm getting for hydros to defend
against<00:04:54.290> more<00:04:55.360> void<00:04:56.360> rays<00:04:56.600> if<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.200> what

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
against more void rays if that is what

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.240 
against more void rays if that is what
he<00:04:58.190> is<00:04:58.220> planning<00:04:58.490> on<00:04:58.730> doing<00:04:59.030> oh<00:05:00.070> but<00:05:01.070> he's

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
he is planning on doing oh but he's

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.730 
he is planning on doing oh but he's
actually<00:05:01.460> decided<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.470> looks<00:05:03.470> like<00:05:03.620> he's

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
actually decided to looks like he's

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.500 
actually decided to looks like he's
stopping<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.400> void<00:05:04.610> rays<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.090> going<00:05:05.360> from

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
stopping the void rays and going from

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.860 
stopping the void rays and going from
more<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.610> ground<00:05:07.940> unit<00:05:08.810> filled<00:05:09.590> with<00:05:10.870> an

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
more of a ground unit filled with an

so we'll see what happens there because

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.070 
so we'll see what happens there because
my<00:05:54.680> hydraulics<00:05:55.310> they<00:05:56.300> will<00:05:56.479> not<00:05:56.690> hold<00:05:56.900> up<00:05:57.050> very

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
my hydraulics they will not hold up very

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.059 
my hydraulics they will not hold up very
well<00:05:57.320> against<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.800> classes

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.879 

one

one

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.279 
one
a<00:06:04.009> huge<00:06:04.520> amount<00:06:04.879> of<00:06:04.909> violence<00:06:05.120> we've<00:06:05.870> got<00:06:06.080> 10<00:06:06.349> 5

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
a huge amount of violence we've got 10 5

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.980 
a huge amount of violence we've got 10 5
he's<00:06:07.889> getting<00:06:08.039> ready<00:06:08.369> for<00:06:08.669> a<00:06:08.909> huge<00:06:09.389> army<00:06:09.689> but

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
he's getting ready for a huge army but

he's getting ready for a huge army but
he's<00:06:10.199> not<00:06:10.469> getting<00:06:10.830> classes<00:06:11.279> right<00:06:11.520> now<00:06:11.839> so

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:13.189 
he's not getting classes right now so

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.839 
he's not getting classes right now so
right<00:06:14.189> now<00:06:14.219> I'm<00:06:14.520> lucky<00:06:14.930> I'd<00:06:15.930> say<00:06:15.960> I'm<00:06:16.379> lucky

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
right now I'm lucky I'd say I'm lucky

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.279 
right now I'm lucky I'd say I'm lucky
about<00:06:17.849> five<00:06:18.089> more<00:06:18.270> roaches<00:06:18.449> on<00:06:18.719> the<00:06:18.809> way<00:06:18.930> he's

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
about five more roaches on the way he's

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.799 
about five more roaches on the way he's
right<00:06:19.680> now<00:06:19.830> building<00:06:20.129> probes<00:06:20.460> but<00:06:21.419> will<00:06:21.569> I<00:06:21.599> be

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:21.809 
right now building probes but will I be

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.709 
right now building probes but will I be
able<00:06:21.839> to<00:06:22.050> break<00:06:22.259> this<00:06:23.449> all<00:06:24.449> right<00:06:24.569> so

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
able to break this all right so

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.250 
able to break this all right so
centuries

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
centuries

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.380 
centuries
may<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.680> force<00:06:27.040> fields<00:06:27.370> at

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
may the force fields at

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.239 
may the force fields at
what

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:42.460 

that<00:06:35.639> far<00:06:36.329> me

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.379 

these<00:06:43.470> leaves<00:06:43.850> that's<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:45.120> end<00:06:45.240> of<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.360> game

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
these leaves that's the end of the game

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:49.610 
these leaves that's the end of the game
so<00:06:45.840> I<00:06:45.870> guess<00:06:46.139> that's<00:06:46.259> a<00:06:46.410> win<00:06:46.560> for<00:06:46.590> me<00:06:47.750> huh<00:06:48.750> well

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
so I guess that's a win for me huh well

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.970 
so I guess that's a win for me huh well
yep<00:06:50.400> good<00:06:50.940> game
