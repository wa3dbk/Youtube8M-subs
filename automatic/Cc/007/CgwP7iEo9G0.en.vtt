good quality I think it worked I was
just<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.050> show<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
just going to kind of show you how to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.240 
just going to kind of show you how to
get<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.980> real<00:00:41.129> big<00:00:41.309> pain<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.690> ass

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
get the it's a real big pain in the ass

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.020 
get the it's a real big pain in the ass
but<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> goes<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:46.039> with<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> left

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
but basically it goes up with the left

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750 
but basically it goes up with the left
side<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.460> side

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
side in first and then the right side

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.470 
side in first and then the right side
comes<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:54.590> when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> say<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.010> again<00:00:56.480> this

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
comes out when I say that again this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
comes out when I say that again this
side<00:00:58.309> comes<00:00:59.309> out<00:00:59.609> last<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.690> almost<00:01:01.559> thought

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
side comes out last I almost thought

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380 
side comes out last I almost thought
that<00:01:02.160> when<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.430> pry<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> had<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> pry

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that when you pry it on you had to pry

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
that when you pry it on you had to pry
this<00:01:03.449> side<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.250> actually

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this side out first but it's actually

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
this side out first but it's actually
the<00:01:06.060> front<00:01:06.390> side<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.680> makes<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> lot

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the front side so that makes a lot

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120 
the front side so that makes a lot
easier<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> remove<00:01:09.799> definitely<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:10.890> save

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
easier to remove definitely would save

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
easier to remove definitely would save
you<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:11.490> time<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.600> let's<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> show<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you some time so let's kind of show you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
you some time so let's kind of show you
what<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.710> standard<00:01:15.049> bulb<00:01:16.049> looks<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
what the standard bulb looks like and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
what the standard bulb looks like and
then<00:01:18.030> I'll<00:01:18.150> put<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> LED<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.200> there

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.550 

you<00:01:24.130> can<00:01:24.250> see<00:01:24.430> it's<00:01:24.550> kind<00:01:24.760> of<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.940> nice<00:01:25.560> bright

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
you can see it's kind of a nice bright

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.460 
you can see it's kind of a nice bright
yellow<00:01:28.530> turn<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.680> off<00:01:29.890> I'm<00:01:30.070> doing<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.430> was

yellow turn this off I'm doing this was

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:45.120 
yellow turn this off I'm doing this was
my<00:01:32.470> own<00:01:32.590> hands<00:01:32.860> here<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.280> give<00:01:33.460> me<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> second<00:01:33.970> uh

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.370 

all<00:01:46.130> right<00:01:46.250> got<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.460> other<00:01:46.700> one<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:46.970> there<00:01:47.180> now

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
all right got the other one on there now

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.910 
all right got the other one on there now
um<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.920> was<00:01:49.220> gonna<00:01:49.600> let<00:01:50.600> us<00:01:50.720> see<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.080> focus<00:01:51.890> I

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
um I was gonna let us see the focus I

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.010 
um I was gonna let us see the focus I
was<00:01:54.920> going<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.400> superglue<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.780> there

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
was going to superglue that in there

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.270 
was going to superglue that in there
just<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.620> make<00:01:57.830> sure<00:01:58.010> that<00:01:58.190> doesn't<00:01:58.430> come<00:01:58.790> out

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
just to make sure that doesn't come out

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.590 
just to make sure that doesn't come out
you<00:02:01.280> can<00:02:01.430> do<00:02:01.550> whatever<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.910> want<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.360> fits

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
you can do whatever you want it fits

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.330 
you can do whatever you want it fits
kind<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.900> loosely<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.950> can<00:02:07.130> see

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
kind of loosely and then you can see

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.760 
kind of loosely and then you can see
there<00:02:07.550> it's<00:02:07.760> like<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.940> nice<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:10.100> nice<00:02:10.310> white<00:02:12.040> um

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
there it's like a nice the nice white um

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.050 
there it's like a nice the nice white um
so<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.160> should<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.430> pretty<00:02:16.640> bright<00:02:16.940> in

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so that that should be pretty bright in

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.030 
so that that should be pretty bright in
the<00:02:17.150> dark<00:02:18.940> um<00:02:19.940> what<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.270> did<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.840> before<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.890> took

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the dark um what I did is before it took

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.000 
the dark um what I did is before it took
took<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.550> out<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.700> took<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:23.030> picture<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.650> numbers

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
took it out I took a picture the numbers

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.510 
took it out I took a picture the numbers
are<00:02:25.280> different<00:02:25.459> on<00:02:25.940> each<00:02:26.239> side<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:27.370> don't<00:02:28.370> know

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
are different on each side I don't know

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.140 
are different on each side I don't know
why<00:02:28.640> my<00:02:28.850> phone's<00:02:29.209> not<00:02:29.830> focusing<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.790> numbers

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
why my phone's not focusing the numbers

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.000 
why my phone's not focusing the numbers
of<00:02:32.300> different<00:02:32.630> ad<00:02:32.750> sites<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.500> way<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.650> kind<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
of different ad sites that way I kind of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
of different ad sites that way I kind of
knew<00:02:34.220> which<00:02:34.489> tie<00:02:34.700> goes<00:02:34.940> where<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.360> which<00:02:35.510> wire

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
knew which tie goes where and which wire

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.440 
knew which tie goes where and which wire
goes<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.170> which<00:02:36.530> terminal<00:02:37.070> they<00:02:38.030> say<00:02:38.180> like<00:02:38.360> if

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
goes to which terminal they say like if

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
goes to which terminal they say like if
it<00:02:38.510> doesn't<00:02:38.600> work<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:38.930> switched<00:02:39.380> around<00:02:39.590> but

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
it doesn't work just switched around but

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.930 
it doesn't work just switched around but
uh<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:42.440> don't<00:02:43.070> know<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.280> didn't<00:02:43.520> sound<00:02:43.730> too<00:02:43.850> good

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
uh I don't know it didn't sound too good

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.520 
uh I don't know it didn't sound too good
to<00:02:44.180> me<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.330> figured<00:02:44.600> out<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.900> do<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:47.530> so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
to me I figured out to do it right so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.979 
to me I figured out to do it right so
yeah<00:02:49.459> basically<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:52.480> LED<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.780> I

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
yeah basically this is the LED that I

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.300 
yeah basically this is the LED that I
got<00:02:54.880> 1250<00:02:55.910> from<00:02:56.660> ebay<00:02:57.549> shipped<00:02:58.549> in<00:02:58.700> three<00:02:58.970> days

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
got 1250 from ebay shipped in three days

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.750 
got 1250 from ebay shipped in three days
seem<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.459> be<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.760> pretty<00:03:02.060> good<00:03:02.209> quality<00:03:02.860> um<00:03:03.860> to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
seem to be a pretty good quality um to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.220 
seem to be a pretty good quality um to
get<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.090> apart<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:07.060> saw<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.360> saw<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.989> couple

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
get this apart I saw I saw a couple

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.020 
get this apart I saw I saw a couple
different<00:03:09.650> ways<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:10.070> people<00:03:10.130> recommended

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
different ways that people recommended

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.130 
different ways that people recommended
to<00:03:11.269> do<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.100> one<00:03:13.100> was<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> hacksaw<00:03:14.209> but

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
to do it and one was like a hacksaw but

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.539 
to do it and one was like a hacksaw but
you<00:03:15.260> can<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.530> kind<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.890> tried<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.130> do<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.459> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
you can see I kind of tried to do on the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.940 
you can see I kind of tried to do on the
right<00:03:16.700> side<00:03:17.000> there<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.620> didn't<00:03:18.620> work<00:03:18.799> too

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
right side there that didn't work too

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.860 
right side there that didn't work too
good<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.760> then<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.120> kind<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.420> remember<00:03:20.780> it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
good and then I kind of remember it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.250 
good and then I kind of remember it
seemed<00:03:21.049> like<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.230> headlight<00:03:22.269> tutorial<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.510> how

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
seemed like a headlight tutorial on how

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.930 
seemed like a headlight tutorial on how
to<00:03:24.290> change<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.920> guy<00:03:25.100> put<00:03:25.670> them<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.850> the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
to change it the guy put them in the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.170 
to change it the guy put them in the
oven<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.890> get<00:03:28.100> apart<00:03:28.430> what<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.670> did<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.060> I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
oven so to get apart what I did is I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.750 
oven so to get apart what I did is I
basically<00:03:29.330> put<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.840> in<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.019> oven<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.500> had<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.640> at

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
basically put it in the oven I had it at

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.050 
basically put it in the oven I had it at
350<00:03:32.180> probably<00:03:33.049> not<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.489> temperature<00:03:34.790> you

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
350 probably not the temperature you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.620 
350 probably not the temperature you
need<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.330> set<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.690> at<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.860> uh<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.540> mean<00:03:38.540> you

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
need to set it at but uh I mean you

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.199 
need to set it at but uh I mean you
could<00:03:38.780> do<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.500> could<00:03:39.650> do<00:03:39.769> probably<00:03:40.220> 200<00:03:41.120> I'd

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
could do you could do probably 200 I'd

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.390 
could do you could do probably 200 I'd
say<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.110> just<00:03:42.320> kind<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.500> laid<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.799> flat<00:03:42.829> on<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
say and I just kind of laid it flat on a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.569 
say and I just kind of laid it flat on a
pan

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
pan

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.000 
pan
let<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.239> sit<00:03:45.420> for<00:03:45.450> two<00:03:45.750> minutes<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.260> probably

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
let it sit for two minutes I probably

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.530 
let it sit for two minutes I probably
said<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> little<00:03:47.579> longer<00:03:47.909> but<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.090> would<00:03:48.269> watch

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
said a little longer but I would watch

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.209 
said a little longer but I would watch
it<00:03:48.569> I'd<00:03:48.989> watched<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.469> the<00:03:49.560> entire<00:03:49.799> time<00:03:50.040> just

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
it I'd watched it the entire time just

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.670 
it I'd watched it the entire time just
to<00:03:50.340> make<00:03:50.459> sure<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.700> doesn't<00:03:50.909> melt<00:03:51.530> because<00:03:52.530> you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
to make sure it doesn't melt because you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.080 
to make sure it doesn't melt because you
definitely<00:03:52.829> don't<00:03:53.159> want<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.400> melt<00:03:53.579> these<00:03:53.760> I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
definitely don't want to melt these I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.280 
definitely don't want to melt these I
don't<00:03:54.359> think<00:03:54.540> they're<00:03:54.689> cheap<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.079> get<00:03:55.200> them

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
don't think they're cheap to get them

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.390 
don't think they're cheap to get them
from<00:03:55.530> Ford<00:03:55.859> so<00:03:56.959> but<00:03:57.959> basically<00:03:58.620> let<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.920> heat

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
from Ford so but basically let it heat

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.059 
from Ford so but basically let it heat
up<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.640> little<00:03:59.760> bit<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.299> kind<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.109> used<00:04:01.379> an<00:04:01.590> exacto

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
up a little bit I kind of used an exacto

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.309 
up a little bit I kind of used an exacto
knife<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.549> loosened<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.090> little<00:04:03.299> bit<00:04:03.510> but

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
knife and loosened it a little bit but

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.920 
knife and loosened it a little bit but
as<00:04:04.409> you<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.739> see<00:04:05.329> on<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.569> whole<00:04:06.720> wall<00:04:06.840> it's

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
as you can see on the whole wall it's

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.080 
as you can see on the whole wall it's
going<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.140> focus<00:04:07.670> basically<00:04:08.670> it's<00:04:08.819> got<00:04:08.939> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
going to focus basically it's got the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.759 
going to focus basically it's got the
ridge<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.900> goes<00:04:09.959> down<00:04:10.379> in<00:04:10.560> there<00:04:10.680> I'm

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
ridge that goes down in there I'm

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.110 
ridge that goes down in there I'm
guessing<00:04:10.950> they<00:04:11.220> just<00:04:11.370> had<00:04:11.489> some<00:04:11.700> kind<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:11.970> glue

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
guessing they just had some kind of glue

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.259 
guessing they just had some kind of glue
so<00:04:12.810> once<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.170> heated<00:04:13.379> up<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.799> came<00:04:14.010> off<00:04:14.340> real

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
so once it heated up it came off real

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.710 
so once it heated up it came off real
nice<00:04:15.769> but<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.849> I<00:04:17.940> kind<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.269> tried<00:04:18.449> to<00:04:18.479> do<00:04:18.660> a

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
nice but I think I kind of tried to do a

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.659 
nice but I think I kind of tried to do a
little<00:04:18.840> lower<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.430> bent

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
little lower like as you can see it bent

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.770 
little lower like as you can see it bent
a<00:04:20.789> little<00:04:20.820> bit<00:04:21.590> mmm<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:23.039> was<00:04:23.160> probably<00:04:23.520> pretty

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
a little bit mmm it was probably pretty

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.909 
a little bit mmm it was probably pretty
pretty<00:04:24.780> warm<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.740> when<00:04:26.009> I<00:04:26.150> when<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.740> hold<00:04:28.740> on

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
pretty warm and when I when I hold on

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.140 
pretty warm and when I when I hold on
it's<00:04:29.190> kind<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.400> bent<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.820> um<00:04:30.860> or<00:04:31.889> or<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:33.000> you

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
it's kind of bent it um or or if you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150 
it's kind of bent it um or or if you
have<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> heat<00:04:33.599> gun<00:04:33.780> I'm<00:04:34.560> guessing<00:04:34.919> that<00:04:35.039> would

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
have a heat gun I'm guessing that would

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.580 
have a heat gun I'm guessing that would
also<00:04:35.310> work<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.699> tried<00:04:35.940> using<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.660> dryer

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
also work I tried using a dryer

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.790 
also work I tried using a dryer
hair<00:04:38.009> dryer<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.759> that<00:04:39.479> did<00:04:39.750> not<00:04:39.780> turn<00:04:40.650> out<00:04:40.770> so

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
hair dryer and that did not turn out so

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.170
