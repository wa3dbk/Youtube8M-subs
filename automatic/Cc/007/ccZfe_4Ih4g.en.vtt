method of pure wolf clean and filtering

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.639 
method of pure wolf clean and filtering
water<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.660> find<00:00:06.930> when<00:00:07.379> you're<00:00:07.560> out

water that you find when you're out

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.299 
water that you find when you're out
wherever<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:09.679> dirty<00:00:10.679> water<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:11.099> got

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
wherever this is like dirty water I got

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.770 
wherever this is like dirty water I got
after<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:12.900> stream<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.230> over<00:00:14.219> there

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
after the little stream that over there

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.200 
after the little stream that over there
so<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:15.960> full<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.230> bits<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.850> crap

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
so it's full of bits and crap

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
so it's full of bits and crap
so<00:00:19.080> I've<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> empty<00:00:20.130> bottle<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
so I've just got a empty bottle here and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.439 
so I've just got a empty bottle here and
then<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.560> book<00:00:24.080> just<00:00:25.080> put<00:00:25.260> over<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.619> top

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
then it's my book just put over the top

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.609 
then it's my book just put over the top
you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.019> anything<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you can do this with anything like a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.659 
you can do this with anything like a
shirt<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.910> something<00:00:31.219> let's<00:00:32.219> put<00:00:32.369> over<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
shirt or something let's put over the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.400 
shirt or something let's put over the
top<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.030> push<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> inside<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.720 

and<00:00:41.830> then<00:00:41.980> just<00:00:42.190> pour<00:00:42.370> your<00:00:42.430> water<00:00:42.670> into<00:00:43.090> it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and then just pour your water into it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.830 
and then just pour your water into it
should<00:00:46.170> collect<00:00:47.170> most<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.980> dirt<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.840> make

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
should collect most of the dirt and make

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:06.970 
should collect most of the dirt and make
the<00:00:49.960> water<00:00:50.190> change<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.370> color<00:00:52.650> like<00:00:53.650> that

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.170 

so<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:08.210> quite<00:01:08.380> quite<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.410> good<00:01:09.650> color<00:01:10.010> change

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
so it's quite quite a good color change

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.080 
so it's quite quite a good color change
it's<00:01:11.180> still<00:01:11.210> quite<00:01:11.540> in<00:01:11.660> there<00:01:11.750> if<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:11.930> look

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
it's still quite in there if you look

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.520 
it's still quite in there if you look
it's<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.860> lot<00:01:15.860> more<00:01:16.040> cleaner<00:01:16.310> than<00:01:16.520> by

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
it's a lot more cleaner than by

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.990 
it's a lot more cleaner than by
filtering<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:19.040> CLE<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.460> water<00:01:19.670> just

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
filtering it the CLE the water just

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.550 
filtering it the CLE the water just
filtered<00:01:20.390> filtering<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.870> through<00:01:20.900> once<00:01:21.410> more

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
filtered filtering it through once more

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.150 
filtered filtering it through once more
into<00:01:22.450> Crusader<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:24.620> then<00:01:24.800> we'll<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.040> this

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
into Crusader and then we'll get this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:35.969 
into Crusader and then we'll get this
boiled<00:01:25.580> up

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.740 

so<00:01:36.520> that's<00:01:36.640> looking<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:37.060> lot<00:01:37.210> better<00:01:37.270> than<00:01:37.659> it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
so that's looking a lot better than it

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.240 
so that's looking a lot better than it
was

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.990 

Hylton<00:01:44.090> wants<00:01:44.420> more<00:01:44.660> Josh's<00:01:45.140> got<00:01:45.350> some

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
Hylton wants more Josh's got some

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.680 
Hylton wants more Josh's got some
kitchen<00:01:47.000> towel<00:01:51.760> so<00:01:52.760> doing<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:53.180> with<00:01:53.420> Loomis

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
kitchen towel so doing this with Loomis

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.310 
kitchen towel so doing this with Loomis
three<00:01:53.930> times<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.440> should<00:01:55.900> make<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.020> water<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
three times it should make the water a

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.260 
three times it should make the water a
lot<00:01:57.470> better<00:01:58.690> be<00:01:59.690> well<00:01:59.900> filtered<00:02:04.090> anyone<00:02:05.090> with

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
lot better be well filtered anyone with

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.870 
lot better be well filtered anyone with
kitchen<00:02:05.570> towel<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.960> does<00:02:06.110> soak<00:02:06.410> up<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.610> get

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
kitchen towel it does soak up so you get

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.340 
kitchen towel it does soak up so you get
some<00:02:08.060> drip<00:02:08.270> off<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.420> edge<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:08.899> shouldn't

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
some drip off the edge but shouldn't

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:26.180 
some drip off the edge but shouldn't
really<00:02:09.440> matter<00:02:13.030> what<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> difference

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.100 

now<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.250> waters<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.660> put<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:28.990> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
now the waters just just put it on the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.590 
now the waters just just put it on the
fire<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.530> boil<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.850> actually<00:02:31.090> get<00:02:31.240> rid<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.420> them

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
fire to boil so actually get rid of them

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.850 
fire to boil so actually get rid of them
any<00:02:31.930> other<00:02:32.290> bacteria<00:02:37.470> after<00:02:38.470> you've<00:02:38.740> done

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
any other bacteria after you've done

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.000 
any other bacteria after you've done
this<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.250> should<00:02:39.460> be<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:40.390> lot<00:02:41.230> safer<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.800> drink

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
this that should be a lot safer to drink

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.150 
this that should be a lot safer to drink
than<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.310> was<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:45.040> hope<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.310> video<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:47.160> BBQ

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
than it was so hope that video and BBQ

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.370 
than it was so hope that video and BBQ
there
