00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.720
 all right 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.170
 i 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 so as not to lose good habits 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 new attack on the blog 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.580
 This liked is known as the bow 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.580
 iris of the book and it's about teaching 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.590
 seven books whose very important loins 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.050
 match the seven colors of the bow 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.480
 iris was created by aristÃ­n reads and 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.890
 it seems simple truth because it does not know anything 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.489
 of headaches that has 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 taken to try to take this post to 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.850
 cocoa thanks 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.149
 the first colors the red and the book 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 whose chosen red loin has been the house 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.800
 of the thousand corridors of tiana wine jones 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.360
 the third of what the castle would be 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.149
 traveling ' good a book that I like 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 a lot but I have not reviewed the blog 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.559
 so maybe when you reread the trilogy 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.559
 maybe I do review I do not know 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.100
 for the orange color chosen the lament 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:08.270
 of the heron and angel the fourth book 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.790
 I think of the legend of the author and a saga that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.830
 alfaguara a long time ago and that already 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.380
 is out of print and a penalty because 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.600
 really beautiful that loin to the best 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.450
 it's not very orange it 's yellow 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.780
 orange but it 's the best thing he gave you 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.780
 against 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.880
 for yellow has decided to one of 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.500
 my favorite books of all 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.830
 times that harry potter and the stone 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.330
 philosopher of jake rowling little can i 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 say about this book is something that has the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.460
 modern yellow loin 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.200
 the green color has meant a lot to me 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.789
 headache because I had several 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.579
 books that could fit but I did not 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.470
 decided for none at the end it has 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.020
 born the maggie trail prize 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.210
 stiefvater the second book of the saga 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.799
 of the logos of mercy force is a book 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 that I really liked a saga that 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.310
 I really like it and I really want to 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.310
 keep reading something more from the author 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.100
 for blue he also had a lot of 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.619
 candidates but in the end I decided that 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.119
 I could not miss in this look for one of 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.729
 my favorite books that is under the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.959
 same star of john green if you want 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.369
 know what I thought you only have to 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.780
 read the review but the truth that a 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.780
 book that I never tire of recommending 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.639
 the color indigo to a color somewhat 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.810
 strange because between blue and violet and the 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.879
 true that I did not have a book that 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.700
 will fit very well with that tone but at 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.730
 final I have chosen prized karaj we have 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.129
 bryant the second of birthmark 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.620
 It's a saga between dystopian and post 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.180
 apocalyptic that I quite like I have 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 really want to read the third and last 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.670
 book and good here is one more 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.040
 and the last color that the violet 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.310
 presents the iron daughter of chuli 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.080
 kagawa the second book of ended already 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.360
 know that a saga that goes for me 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.110
 increscendo and I never get tired of 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.110
 recommend it 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.540
 and now that you have seen the little arch 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.760
 directs mounted I encourage you that there is also 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.930
 you this one and see you next 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.930
 video go 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.409
 or 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.620
 do not
