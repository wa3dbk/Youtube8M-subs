00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.520
 and my friend andrea 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.770
 we are here to do but the usual true 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.509
 traditional bourgeois cuisine this is 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.669
 a recipe that I owe even when I was 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.770
 pc's aren't that big of an hour though 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.259
 when I was close to me they didn't have it 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.960
 always make a mother who has not been rebuilt 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.430
 be a recipe handed down from 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 generation in generation 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 now they are not kind of stuff together 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 to the frit of a woman with cheese e 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 without the poor dialogue they begin 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.620
 immediately with ingredients for 4 people 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.740
 half a white onion and half soles of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.990
 red hill bit of chili pepper half 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.290
 kilo me for another 50 grams of 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.420
 parmesan 6 eggs a modesty I had to good 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.700
 as usual and salt and pepper 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.309
 first operation to do does the omelette 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.860
 we take our hours ago called yours 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.010
 a container then we add a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.940
 Parmesan for pinzi continuous of will 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.590
 even two hurts to hurt I would be slow 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.290
 rockets the eggs so that's a bit of me 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 let's teams all over my head no 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.740
 I recommend 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 the revenue while the format that 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.579
 it transforms but you don't know but you do it 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.380
 heat well well but add pan 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.560
 a few tablespoons if not even more 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 one and a half so much for a non- freeze canvas 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 does attack the omelette sizes territory 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.530
 everything at the bottom of the pan is a city 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.429
 that the destiny that scale living well 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.280
 I wanted hot I go to do ours 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:02:00.990
 omelette let's like the part of 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.569
 below with this movement we will have water 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.049
 choose more egg from our city from 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:11.670
 lalut here then I am going to turn here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.190
 it will be the hurry let's assert less the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.670
 Flame put that thing too as 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.470
 head art and then it will be ready meanwhile 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.680
 the boat boat finishes cooking 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.230
 let's go for morning of onions for 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.880
 do our 66 years tomato mi 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.799
 I recommend neither too fine nor too much weight 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.620
 that one then feels reasons from the intro 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.650
 I mention it was well known with the famous one 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.370
 omelette onions ice cold beer the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.129
 burp free frontal omelettes 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.930
 I'm found yesterday but let's put some 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.909
 I read our chopped veins 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.580
 fry all his with divine 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.470
 I recommend the poor ones too 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.409
 today we are small and those caught 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.720
 from the same way as the houses it is 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.110
 come to say our firsts to do 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.540
 I recommend our goal 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.430
 tried crushed repeats doing so 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.019
 first add a little salt 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.019
 let us take the kettle well to the 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.989
 tomato and let's go to escape how to say 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.629
 of the usual spoon abbasciÃ  say a 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.690
 free piece to make the work work 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.099
 our tomato and make it withdraw in the meantime 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.720
 to spend a little bit because I feel that 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.609
 he is already appreciated color then 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.829
 low no it just burns 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.049
 meanwhile our municipality has 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.340
 finished the cooking ends let's say 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.299
 we go to do we thought we are making 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.810
 strips 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.920
 in these dimensions a little green 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.849
 moussa 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.180
 and so up to what to do if you can't not 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:57.019
 agents are sent diagonally 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.700
 harmful as a small piece of tripe 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.540
 gorlesi we are very original these 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.459
 there is fake or rented naples 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.080
 francesina we have always been a lot 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.670
 competitive and we always have 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.000
 the spirit of initiative goes 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.080
 safeguarded were more your fancy 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.530
 it should have become that way 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.760
 reach our omelette 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.700
 previously inertia 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.840
 now let's go live with all the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.660
 tomato, his duty as a positive 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.050
 this is very easy for infinity 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.060
 the oil heaven add and another away 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 couple of rioters dived into coach and 2 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.060
 minutes to the omelette as you come has 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:52.860
 spent a nice little color if i pippata 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:56.290
 lariani to implant here is here martino 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.390
 seems to have become pure simple mibs like 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.510
 as understandings and go 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:07.920
