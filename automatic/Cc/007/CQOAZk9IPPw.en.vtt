00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
different game type but I was on I think

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.780 
different game type but I was on I think
free-for-all<00:03:14.810> all<00:03:15.290> team<00:03:15.620> deathmatch<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.370> it

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
free-for-all all team deathmatch and it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.390 
free-for-all all team deathmatch and it
didn't<00:03:17.180> work<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:18.110> nuke<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.560> not<00:03:18.920> confirmed

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
didn't work so the nuke is not confirmed

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.520 
didn't work so the nuke is not confirmed
the<00:03:19.700> nuke<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.090> not<00:03:20.360> there<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.260> won't<00:03:21.320> get

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
the nuke is not there and you won't get

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.230 
the nuke is not there and you won't get
a<00:03:21.590> nuke<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:21.950> black<00:03:22.130> ops<00:03:22.370> 2<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:22.640> why<00:03:23.030> have<00:03:23.150> you

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
a nuke and black ops 2 so why have you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.949

Ashley<00:03:32.930> I'm<00:03:32.990> pretty<00:03:33.320> sure<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:33.590> don't<00:03:33.709> exist

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
Ashley I'm pretty sure we don't exist

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.980 
Ashley I'm pretty sure we don't exist
because<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:34.910> trial<00:03:35.090> free-for-all<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:35.600> team

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
because it's trial free-for-all and team

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.810 
because it's trial free-for-all and team
deathmatch<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:36.890> he<00:03:36.980> don't<00:03:37.100> exist<00:03:37.459> on<00:03:37.580> them

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
deathmatch and if he don't exist on them

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.729 
deathmatch and if he don't exist on them
what<00:03:38.540> game<00:03:38.720> talks<00:03:38.989> where<00:03:39.140> they<00:03:39.230> will<00:03:39.970> exist<00:03:40.970> on

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
what game talks where they will exist on

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.960 
what game talks where they will exist on
and<00:03:42.739> now<00:03:42.890> I'm<00:03:43.040> not<00:03:43.160> too<00:03:43.310> sure<00:03:43.520> if<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.760> need<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and now I'm not too sure if you need to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.850 
and now I'm not too sure if you need to
get<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> certain<00:03:44.630> level<00:03:44.780> or<00:03:45.140> certain<00:03:45.650> kill

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
get to a certain level or certain kill

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.430 
get to a certain level or certain kill
streak<00:03:46.190> or<00:03:46.430> whatever<00:03:47.000> guys<00:03:47.300> but<00:03:48.050> definitely

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
streak or whatever guys but definitely

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.470 
streak or whatever guys but definitely

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
me I'm it's just it's just a freezer and

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.789 
me I'm it's just it's just a freezer and
the<00:04:17.330> maps<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.750> massive<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.320> get<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.500> boss<00:04:18.680> that

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
the maps and massive you get a boss that

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.979 
the maps and massive you get a boss that
goes<00:04:18.950> around<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.340> map

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
goes around the map

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.200 
goes around the map
now<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.289> go<00:04:20.410> chop<00:04:20.829> off<00:04:20.979> different<00:04:21.280> areas<00:04:21.699> yeah

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
now you go chop off different areas yeah

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.640 
now you go chop off different areas yeah
I<00:04:22.270> think<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.479> get<00:04:22.600> four<00:04:22.840> areas<00:04:23.380> you've<00:04:23.560> got

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
I think you get four areas you've got

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.610 
I think you get four areas you've got
the<00:04:23.710> first<00:04:23.919> area<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.400> second<00:04:24.729> area<00:04:25.319> the<00:04:26.319> third

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the first area the second area the third

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.969 
the first area the second area the third
area<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:28.000> fourth<00:04:28.300> era<00:04:28.660> area<00:04:29.530> yes<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.860> got

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
area and the fourth era area yes I got

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.070 
area and the fourth era area yes I got
four<00:04:30.190> different<00:04:30.520> areas<00:04:30.729> all<00:04:31.300> around<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:31.990> then

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
four different areas all around and then

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.999 
four different areas all around and then
you<00:04:32.110> go<00:04:32.259> back<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.560> beginning<00:04:32.680> again

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
you go back to the beginning again

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.339 
you go back to the beginning again
different<00:04:33.970> areas<00:04:34.419> gives<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.870> gives<00:04:35.259> you

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
different areas gives you the gives you

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.680 
different areas gives you the gives you
different<00:04:35.560> clues<00:04:36.009> basically<00:04:36.610> for<00:04:37.210> an<00:04:37.270> example

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
different clues basically for an example

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.689 
different clues basically for an example
if<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.900> start<00:04:38.199> off<00:04:38.410> on<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.710> first<00:04:38.889> area<00:04:39.370> and

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
if you start off on the first area and

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.960 
if you start off on the first area and
you<00:04:40.479> got<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.229> weapons<00:04:41.590> there<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.430> you

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
you got like the weapons there and you

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.559 
you got like the weapons there and you

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
know because a on each of the areas you

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.300 
know because a on each of the areas you
can<00:04:46.720> build<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.169> special<00:04:47.440> weapon<00:04:48.009> you<00:04:48.130> need<00:04:48.220> to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
can build a special weapon you need to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.860 
can build a special weapon you need to
look<00:04:48.400> for<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.580> parts<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:49.539> get<00:04:49.720> like<00:04:49.810> a

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
look for the parts and you get like a

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.080 
look for the parts and you get like a
little<00:04:49.930> like<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:50.860> little<00:04:51.190> machine<00:04:51.400> next<00:04:51.910> to

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
little like a little machine next to

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.350 
little like a little machine next to
where<00:04:52.419> like<00:04:53.520> next<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.610> something<00:04:54.849> kinda<00:04:55.240> way

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
where like next to something kinda way

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.570 
where like next to something kinda way
but<00:04:55.810> then<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.020> put<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.289> pots<00:04:56.530> on<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:57.099> table

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
but then you put the pots on the table

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.339 
but then you put the pots on the table
and<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:57.789> can<00:04:57.849> fix<00:04:58.150> them<00:04:58.300> together<00:04:58.509> on<00:04:59.080> each

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
and you can fix them together on each

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.510 
and you can fix them together on each
different<00:04:59.639> area<00:05:01.889> but<00:05:02.889> it's<00:05:03.009> really<00:05:03.250> awesome

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
different area but it's really awesome
