00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
knife edge trail doesn't do anything to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
knife edge trail doesn't do anything to
my<00:00:36.690> painting<00:00:37.680> into<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.129> funky<00:00:38.520> thing<00:00:38.700> here

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
my painting into some funky thing here

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.310 
my painting into some funky thing here
you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> doesn't<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.110> much<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you can see but it doesn't do much of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.790 
you can see but it doesn't do much of
any<00:00:40.590> use<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.739> want<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
any use it's not what I'm want to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200 
any use it's not what I'm want to
achieve<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> same<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:44.700> goes<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
achieve and the same thing goes for this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.160 
achieve and the same thing goes for this
so<00:00:46.219> these<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> me<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so these these are not of use to me and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
so these these are not of use to me and
mostly<00:00:49.500> they're<00:00:49.680> making<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> difficult<00:00:50.280> for

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
mostly they're making it difficult for

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
mostly they're making it difficult for
