you make it too wet it's a bit harder to
sort<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> start<00:01:03.719> incorporating<00:01:04.080> too<00:01:04.860> much

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
sort of start incorporating too much

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.670 
sort of start incorporating too much
flour<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.170> better<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.619> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
flour into it so it's better to have it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640 
flour into it so it's better to have it
a<00:01:07.830> little<00:01:07.860> drier<00:01:08.430> than<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.820> living<00:01:09.150> too<00:01:09.510> wet<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.160 
just to make sure it doesn't oxidize but
you<00:01:43.110> shouldn't<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:44.090> say<00:01:45.090> we've<00:01:46.020> met

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you shouldn't actually say we've met

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
you shouldn't actually say we've met
I'll<00:01:46.290> pass<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> rest<00:01:46.979> I'm<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.090> flatten<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
I'll pass the rest I'm just flatten it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
I'll pass the rest I'm just flatten it
out<00:01:48.750> slightly<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:52.020> wait<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.890> gates

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
out slightly and wait about these gates

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.390 
out slightly and wait about these gates
I<00:01:53.490> close<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
I close it

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.670 
I close it
so<00:01:55.240> always<00:01:55.390> make<00:01:55.510> sure<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.960> try<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.440> improve

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
so always make sure you try and improve

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.260 
so always make sure you try and improve
its<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.980> machine<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.490> don't<00:01:57.670> fall<00:01:57.970> right

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
its the machine and don't fall right

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.570 
its the machine and don't fall right
through<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:59.380> it's<00:01:59.590> not<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.950> know<00:02:00.070> thin<00:02:00.340> enough

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
through if it's not you know thin enough

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.250 
through if it's not you know thin enough
for<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:00.880> dial<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:01.540> wicks<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.140> they

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
for that dial and that wicks and they

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.810 
for that dial and that wicks and they
take<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.620> back<00:02:02.650> we'll<00:02:03.130> roll<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.400> out<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.640> bit

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
take it back we'll roll this out a bit

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.900 
take it back we'll roll this out a bit
more<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.710> busted<00:02:06.100> in<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> machine<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.790> all

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
more that busted in the machine and all

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.430 
more that busted in the machine and all
you'll<00:02:07.030> do<00:02:07.210> make<00:02:07.420> sure<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.720> past<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.350> this

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
you'll do make sure you past it in this

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:17.550 
you'll do make sure you past it in this
sort<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.680> concertina<00:02:12.810> Alfie<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> they

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
sort of concertina Alfie so they

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
sort of concertina Alfie so they
basically<00:02:17.740> rolled<00:02:18.100> up<00:02:18.280> master<00:02:18.520> it's<00:02:18.850> quite

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
basically rolled up master it's quite

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.240 
basically rolled up master it's quite
thing<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:20.320> people<00:02:20.350> like<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.830> really<00:02:20.950> see

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
thing some people like it really see

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.560 
thing some people like it really see
through<00:02:21.460> but<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:21.820> not<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.150> know<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.300> want<00:02:22.540> a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
through but it's not you know you want a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.000 
through but it's not you know you want a
bit<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.870> bite<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.350> you've<00:02:23.740> got<00:02:23.890> it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
bit of a bite to it you've got it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.200 
bit of a bite to it you've got it
managed<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> get<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.580> whole<00:02:24.730> whip<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> the

managed to get the whole whip to the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.240 
managed to get the whole whip to the
machine<00:02:25.540> then<00:02:25.720> cut<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.080> down<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.380> center<00:02:26.410> and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
machine then cut it down the center and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.250 
machine then cut it down the center and
you're<00:02:27.490> going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.120> lots<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.720> so

top part of it very lightly does that

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.290 
top part of it very lightly does that
make<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.500> too<00:02:47.740> much<00:02:47.950> all<00:02:48.550> these<00:02:48.700> extra<00:02:49.120> bits

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
make it too much all these extra bits

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.970 
make it too much all these extra bits
you<00:02:49.480> don't<00:02:49.630> waste<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:50.140> when<00:02:50.740> we're<00:02:50.890> making

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
you don't waste them when we're making

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.220 
you don't waste them when we're making
it<00:02:51.280> at<00:02:51.370> home<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.910> tend<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> just<00:02:52.570> put<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.870> reroll

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
it at home I tend to just put it reroll

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.930 
it at home I tend to just put it reroll
it<00:02:53.410> again<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.770> put<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:53.980> into<00:02:54.160> bags<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.640> making

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
it again and put it into bags and making

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.310 
it again and put it into bags and making
it<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.060> tell<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.390> telly<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.960> don't<00:02:56.140> waste

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
it to tell you telly so you don't waste

it to tell you telly so you don't waste
anything<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.710> bit<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.280> then<00:02:57.430> fold<00:02:57.760> over<00:02:57.910> your

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
anything a bit so then fold over your

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.510 
anything a bit so then fold over your
pasta<00:02:58.930> gently<00:02:59.560> nice<00:02:59.739> so<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.040> can<00:03:00.250> dip<00:03:00.370> your

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
pasta gently nice so you can dip your

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520 
pasta gently nice so you can dip your
hand<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.000> flour<00:03:01.239> turn<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.780> sort<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.020> cop<00:03:02.320> it

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
hand in the flour turn it sort of cop it

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.100 
hand in the flour turn it sort of cop it
so<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> goes<00:03:03.400> around<00:03:03.550> each<00:03:03.970> little<00:03:04.270> Tortelli

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
so it goes around each little Tortelli

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.040 
so it goes around each little Tortelli
nice<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.310> then<00:03:06.850> take<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.180> top<00:03:07.390> half<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.959> then

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
nice so then take the top half and then

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.449 
nice so then take the top half and then
fold<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.440> back<00:03:08.560> over<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.500> again<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:12.370> know

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
fold that back over and again you know

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.490 
fold that back over and again you know
not<00:03:12.760> crush<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.570> down<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:14.020> just<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.470> know

not crush it down but just you know

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.610 
not crush it down but just you know
flatten<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> pastor<00:03:15.400> down<00:03:15.550> seal<00:03:16.000> it

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
flatten the pastor down seal it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.840 
flatten the pastor down seal it
