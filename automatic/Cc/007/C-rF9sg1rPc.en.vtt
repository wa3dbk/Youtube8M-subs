you know divide that up between 12 no

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.419 
you know divide that up between 12 no
it's<00:00:27.390> not<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:28.019> great<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.710> sounds<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
when you divide it all up it's you know

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.440 
when you divide it all up it's you know
just<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.210> average<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:36.989> family<00:00:37.770> farm<00:00:38.450> GPS

crop this year you know

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.450 
crop this year you know
chances<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.590> probably<00:02:13.710> pretty<00:02:13.980> good<00:02:14.220> thing

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
chances are probably pretty good thing

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.010 
chances are probably pretty good thing
you<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.790> price<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.270> also<00:02:15.630> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> go

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you know the price is also going to go

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.190 
you know the price is also going to go
down<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:17.070> because<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.060> know<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.450> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
down this because you know there is so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.670 
down this because you know there is so
much<00:02:19.320> more<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.850> soybeans<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.780> think
