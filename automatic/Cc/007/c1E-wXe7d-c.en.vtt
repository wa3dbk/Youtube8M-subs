00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello how about you guys now let's see a 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.000
 trick here in the rise for me is the most 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.160
 easy to do it is very good is very very 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.420
 good and it's very simple the only thing 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.090
 will have to do will come to this area 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.710
 placed next to the wall to go 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.720
 climbing with the trampita removed until 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.609
 that you see the jerry touch is separating 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.130
 the two stones and I put you a little 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.109
 above I point just to the point with 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.119
 the weapon to marry you with the copla and 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.780
 now in hd I imagine that it will be much 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.220
 easier that you get the site a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.440
 once put in the trap before it 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.440
 surcharge you place on the wall and you wait 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.120
 go to bed once you have jumped 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.220
 you will be in the trick and you can start 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.380
 to pass rounds I was testing 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.180
 there and center and they were thirty thirty and 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.220
 two rounds more or less that were 32 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 and I did not like it, it did not end 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.430
 to like because some host so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.050
 they give you right where you see right now 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 I'm in this position, some host yes 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
 that they gave me with what the more 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 go up the rounds in the zombies 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.570
 faster they will give you and before then 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.510
 they will capture you and not like that is not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.490
 smart then the good idea is in 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 instead of standing what we will do 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.510
 will be bending down crouching us what 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 we will get will be to get inside 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.830
 a small room that is below 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.869
 of us right now once we're 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.610
 inside that room will be very 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.550
 simple we will have to paste everything 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.990
 everything to the left that we can and a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.570
 once we are all to the left that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.040
 we can pull forward until 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.899
 that we touch against a small wall 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.660
 when we play against this little girl 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.600
 Now you will see wall as I do here 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.910
 it's very simple all the zombies are going 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.470
 pile up front a lot is done 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.670
 perfect action if you remember 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.740
 dispatch the weapon 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.600
 You can catch almost almost all 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.520
 bonuses a true pass the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.900
 trick that you are going to be able to inflate them makes 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.880
 rounds and I think of the companions 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.070
 put to the bottom where are the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 mattresses would also go no any 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.700
 family by them all would be to prove it 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.590
 I tried it I only then that what 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.780
 there is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.729
 and nothing guys is a real last 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 shoot them instead of shooting just 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.599
 in front of you shoot those who 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.280
 are rising and so you will get 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.500
 let us splash and let us move 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.209
 from the position to the bugs these 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 disgusting you already know that with the weather 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 because we got all the drinks that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.269
 nothing, guys, I hope you like it 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.370
 help a little bit of heart like you 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.370
 liked it and until the next video 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.810
 I am a kind of mists I thought not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.810
 lets you see horizon you've crouched 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.030
 poison head for your ears many 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.519
 noises confesses that here the good 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.439
 you come back and you already fixing me 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.049
 bedroom because the only dust that 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.329
 jump on top of your desk then 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.670
 it sounds not that by default it made a theme 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.260
 how is it mandatory by default 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.510
 new shit that comes from the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.640
 neck you try to make it normal that nobody 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.739
 I want you looking for your texts 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.079
 I found the trash can come fierce 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.150
 you wait to plant us with the insect this 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.220
 it's my sector come, throw yourself from a hedge 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.440
 I become an actor and reacted by his 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.019
 straight skid on my engine and we ride 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.670
 a good live not like you this does not 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.079

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.079
