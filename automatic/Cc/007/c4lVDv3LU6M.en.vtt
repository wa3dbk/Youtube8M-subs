know not a whole lot about this it's
particularly<00:00:46.730> special<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.449> can<00:00:47.840> show<00:00:48.019> it<00:00:48.109> to

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
particularly special I can show it to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.650 
particularly special I can show it to
you<00:00:48.289> compared<00:00:48.679> to<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.129> performance

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
you compared to the performance

the controller you cannot save with

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.079 
the controller you cannot save with
these<00:00:59.829> I<00:01:00.829> never<00:01:01.460> thought<00:01:01.730> there<00:01:01.969> would<00:01:02.059> be

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
these I never thought there would be

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.790 
these I never thought there would be
anyone<00:01:02.300> out<00:01:02.390> there<00:01:02.510> didn't<00:01:02.960> know<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.230> but

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
anyone out there didn't know that but

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.760 
anyone out there didn't know that but
there<00:01:04.160> was<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:05.750> now<00:01:05.930> I'm<00:01:06.049> clarifying<00:01:06.560> that

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
there was and so now I'm clarifying that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.410 
there was and so now I'm clarifying that
these<00:01:07.040> things<00:01:07.280> do<00:01:07.460> not<00:01:07.520> allow<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:07.909> to<00:01:08.000> save<00:01:08.240> to

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
these things do not allow you to save to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.999 
these things do not allow you to save to
it<00:01:08.570> it's<00:01:08.750> possible<00:01:08.990> there<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.590> some<00:01:09.860> other

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
it it's possible there is some other

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.160 
it it's possible there is some other
third-party<00:01:10.490> one<00:01:10.790> that<00:01:11.000> can<00:01:11.150> do<00:01:11.299> both<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.869> don't

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
third-party one that can do both I don't

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.490 
third-party one that can do both I don't
know<00:01:12.439> I<00:01:12.740> don't<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.430> yet<00:01:14.439> anyway<00:01:15.439> so

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
know I don't have it yet anyway so

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.740 
know I don't have it yet anyway so
there's<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.220> one<00:01:16.460> by<00:01:16.610> performance<00:01:17.090> and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
there's this one by performance and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.560 
there's this one by performance and
there's<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:18.470> yellow<00:01:19.130> stained<00:01:19.759> one<00:01:20.030> by<00:01:20.299> naki

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
there's this yellow stained one by naki

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.160 
there's this yellow stained one by naki
and<00:01:21.460> I've<00:01:22.460> never<00:01:22.640> heard<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.880> Nike<00:01:23.240> still<00:01:24.020> said

they are but they made this and it turns
yellow<00:01:27.170> which<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.500> one<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.619> its<00:01:27.740> cooler

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
yellow which is one of its cooler

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.609 
yellow which is one of its cooler
features<00:01:28.990> then<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.079> course<00:01:30.259> this<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.500> it

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619

vibration<00:01:34.820> pack<00:01:34.969> jump<00:01:35.420> pack<00:01:35.600> thing<00:01:36.170> yeah<00:01:38.560> yeah

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
vibration pack jump pack thing yeah yeah

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.219 
vibration pack jump pack thing yeah yeah
if<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.520> see<00:01:40.729> those<00:01:40.850> other<00:01:41.000> videos<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.689> try<00:01:41.960> to

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
if you see those other videos I try to

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.770 
if you see those other videos I try to
get<00:01:42.409> them<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.649> hook<00:01:43.040> up<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> VM<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.780> I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
realized the Nike one can actually do
