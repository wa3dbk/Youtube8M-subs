far hourly our league record isn't the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
far hourly our league record isn't the
best<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.509> confident<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.200> will<00:01:55.320> be

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
best but I'm confident that we will be

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
best but I'm confident that we will be
qualifying<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.520> six<00:01:56.729> place<00:01:57.170> excuse<00:01:58.170> me

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
qualifying we're in six place excuse me

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.370 
qualifying we're in six place excuse me
we're<00:01:58.469> 12<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.829> 16<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.250> now<00:01:59.369> we<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.540> two<00:02:00.810> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
we're 12 and 16 right now we have two I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
we're 12 and 16 right now we have two I
think<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> magic<00:02:02.399> number<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.729> 20<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
think the magic number is like 20 and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
think the magic number is like 20 and
there's<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.600> decent<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:04.049> games<00:02:04.200> left<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.799> can

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there's a decent of games left so we can

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920 
there's a decent of games left so we can
definitely<00:02:05.250> turn<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.719> to

the only reason I keep mine like this is

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.730 
the only reason I keep mine like this is
because<00:06:16.750> I<00:06:16.840> have<00:06:16.960> these<00:06:17.110> cabinets<00:06:17.410> over<00:06:17.590> here

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740
