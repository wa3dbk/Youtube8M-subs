house<00:01:56.060> now<00:01:56.870> this<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.560> much<00:01:57.860> easier<00:01:57.890> way<00:01:58.340> than

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
house now this is a much easier way than

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.610 
house now this is a much easier way than

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
which is just through here and then if

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.710 
which is just through here and then if
you<00:02:30.709> jump<00:02:31.310> into<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.670> kitchen<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.450> got<00:02:32.600> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
you jump into the kitchen you got the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.000 
you jump into the kitchen you got the
answers<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> kitchen<00:02:33.500> now<00:02:33.530> something

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
answers to the kitchen now something

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.030 
answers to the kitchen now something
that<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.190> can't<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:35.590> walk<00:02:36.590> through<00:02:36.860> this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
that you can't do is a walk through this

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.710 
that you can't do is a walk through this
door<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.459> think<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.120> reason<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.510> can't

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
door and I think the reason you can't

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.729 
door and I think the reason you can't
walk<00:02:38.840> through<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.140> door<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.470> because<00:02:39.620> we

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
walk through that door is because we

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.160 
walk through that door is because we
tried<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.100> patch<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.550> car<00:02:40.760> glitch<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.330> but

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
tried to patch the car glitch and but

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.990 
tried to patch the car glitch and but
this<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> brand<00:02:42.709> new<00:02:42.770> glitch<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.430> hope<00:02:43.760> you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
this is a brand new glitch so I hope you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.600 
this is a brand new glitch so I hope you
enjoy<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.660> now<00:02:44.930> another<00:02:45.290> thing<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:46.550> you

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
enjoy it now another thing and that you

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.640 
enjoy it now another thing and that you
can<00:02:46.640> do<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.330> we<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.720> disable<00:02:48.200> passive<00:02:48.500> mode

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
can do if we just disable passive mode

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.580 
can do if we just disable passive mode
here<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:51.850> actually<00:02:52.850> destroy<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.230> pillow

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
here and is actually destroy this pillow

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.740 
here and is actually destroy this pillow
which<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.010> over<00:02:55.280> here<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.269> can<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.600> this

in<00:02:57.340> story<00:02:58.340> mode<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:59.290> but<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.320> just<00:03:00.560> thought

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
in story mode and but I just thought

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
in story mode and but I just thought
it'd<00:03:00.799> be<00:03:00.860> pretty<00:03:01.400> clothing<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.940> show<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.150> and
