00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.950
 custom bikes listening to you name 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.110
 may not know exactly what it is 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.210
 but if you have ever been to one of them 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.040
 It sure caught your eye. 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.820
 even if you are not a big fan of 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.820
 motorcycle 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 the wave of customizing the bikes has come 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.660
 years ago in the United States, it is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 with the lack of options left after the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.010
 motorcyclists were obliged to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.650
 be creative to prepare their 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.140
 post-war motorcycles that happened 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.059
 only an old car thrown out only 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.550
 Putt only paint then to catch 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.710
 that whole old restored car 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.460
 make that painting with flake who 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.870
 administer and rehearse on the street parading 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 although it is an old practice of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 quite a tradition out here in Brazil 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.640
 customization of motorcycles is still 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.410
 view as a novelty the customer wants 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 be totally exclusive 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.020
 so he tries to have a certain one 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.600
 line of design that already exists in the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.479
 or for example a shopper a bomb an 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.690
 coffee racer for many fans of this style 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 custom bike goes well beyond the visual is a 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.580
 lifestyle and art and this is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.890
 perceptible in the process to make 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.259
 a customization that is not simple at all 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 since all the work is done by hand 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.039
 handcrafted 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.649
 after all the idea is to make each 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.429
 motorcycle has its identity 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.429
 own 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.020
 but for many this whole process of 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.090
 transformation of the model ends up being the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.040
 best part and is becoming a hobby one 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 big people's play 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.020
 own cost is the way to lose 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.460
 the fear of the total face of total finish 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.100
 maneuvers and carrying that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.290
 This is a virus that will sting. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.660
 the guy without understanding ever again he goes 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.000
 able to recover from your customer 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.970
 customization that understands the culture it 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.340
 want to participate in the process is to see that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.060
 follow resale where the piece came not 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.880
 live a new line as it was done 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.330
 apespe the process gives give gives another actor 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.760
 mechanical welding 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.180
 the type of preparation and the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 handmade 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.900
 looking at all these models 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.880
 differentiated 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.770
 you must be wondering how much 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.830
 It has to be spent on time and money. 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.890
 to set up a real custom 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.290
 Well, everything depends on the creativity and 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.150
 daring of the owner because as the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.670
 experts say in the world of 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.670
 customization there are no limits
