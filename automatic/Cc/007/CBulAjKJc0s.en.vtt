future so I'll give you some more tips
and<00:01:47.640> insights<00:01:47.970> about<00:01:48.210> how<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and insights about how to do that

and insights about how to do that
in<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.220> tutorial<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.000> will<00:01:51.030> touch<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> little

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
in this tutorial I will touch a little

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
in this tutorial I will touch a little
bit<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> histogram<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.130> I'll<00:01:53.340> show<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
bit on the histogram so I'll show you a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
bit on the histogram so I'll show you a
couple<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:54.000> tips<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.290> depth

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
couple of tips but will go more in depth

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.100 
couple of tips but will go more in depth
at<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> later<00:01:56.100> date<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:57.090> below<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
at a later date and then below that you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
at a later date and then below that you
have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.350> bunch<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.920> sliders<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> these<00:01:59.759> are

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
have a bunch of sliders and these are

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
have a bunch of sliders and these are
again<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.479> those<00:02:00.719> typical<00:02:01.020> things<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.619> would

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
again all those typical things you would

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
again all those typical things you would
do<00:02:01.920> when<00:02:02.130> processing<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.759> photos<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
do when processing your photos like

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
do when processing your photos like
white<00:02:03.509> balance<00:02:03.719> sliders<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.219> know

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
white balance sliders and you know

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
white balance sliders and you know
contrast<00:02:05.850> highlights<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.509> those<00:02:06.659> types<00:02:06.869> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
contrast highlights all those types of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.839 
contrast highlights all those types of
things<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.320> let's<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.190> ahead<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> start

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
things so let's go ahead and start

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.210 
things so let's go ahead and start
playing<00:02:09.090> around<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.539> sliders<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.170> let<00:02:11.129> me

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
playing around the sliders and let me

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.470 
playing around the sliders and let me
show<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.730> work

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
show you how they work

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
show you how they work
so<00:02:13.470> let's<00:02:13.650> go<00:02:13.770> ahead<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.010> start<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.340> our

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
so let's go ahead and start with our

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.979 
so let's go ahead and start with our
white<00:02:14.640> balance<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.150> temperature<00:02:15.569> settings

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
white balance and temperature settings

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.020 
white balance and temperature settings
so<00:02:16.349> if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:17.129> you'll<00:02:17.730> see<00:02:17.910> that

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so if you go up here you'll see that

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.430 
so if you go up here you'll see that
under<00:02:18.239> white<00:02:18.540> balance<00:02:18.930> there's<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.170> drop<00:02:19.410> down

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
under white balance there's a drop down

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.320 
under white balance there's a drop down
menu<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.190> has<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> bunch<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.760> options<00:02:21.030> that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
menu and it has a bunch of options that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.729 
menu and it has a bunch of options that
are<00:02:21.480> probably<00:02:21.750> very<00:02:21.840> similar<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
are probably very similar to what you

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.140 
are probably very similar to what you
have<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.129> camera<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:24.030> you're

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
have on your camera so if you're

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.940 
have on your camera so if you're
shooting<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> cloudy<00:02:24.959> day<00:02:25.110> or<00:02:25.620> under

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
shooting on a cloudy day or under

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.589 
shooting on a cloudy day or under
fluorescent<00:02:26.489> lighting<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.090> would<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.480> would

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
fluorescent lighting you would you would

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.320 
fluorescent lighting you would you would
select<00:02:28.230> one<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> those<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.310> also<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:30.000> auto

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
select one of those you can also do auto

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.780 
select one of those you can also do auto
and<00:02:30.959> what<00:02:31.110> auto<00:02:31.319> will<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.069> it'll<00:02:32.430> tell

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and what auto will do is it'll tell

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.759 
and what auto will do is it'll tell
Camera<00:02:33.180> Raw<00:02:33.330> look<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.140> my<00:02:34.170> image<00:02:34.500> data

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
Camera Raw look at all of my image data

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.650 
Camera Raw look at all of my image data
and<00:02:34.950> try<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.700> figure<00:02:35.849> out<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.209> right<00:02:36.390> white

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and try and figure out the right white

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.720 
and try and figure out the right white
balance<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.290> photo<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.489> case

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
balance for this photo and in this case

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.430 
balance for this photo and in this case
it<00:02:39.030> didn't<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.330> very<00:02:39.569> good<00:02:39.630> job<00:02:39.780> however<00:02:40.230> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it didn't do a very good job however I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.199 
it didn't do a very good job however I
will<00:02:40.650> say<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.980> typically<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.519> nails<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.060> or

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
will say that typically it nails it or

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.600 
will say that typically it nails it or
it<00:02:42.269> gets<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.510> really<00:02:43.019> close<00:02:43.319> but<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.430> case

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
it gets it really close but in this case

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250 
it gets it really close but in this case
it<00:02:44.760> didn't<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.209> what<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.360> would<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.110> I

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
it didn't so what I would do here is I

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.990 
it didn't so what I would do here is I
just<00:02:46.319> manually<00:02:47.010> adjust<00:02:47.340> my<00:02:47.489> temperature<00:02:47.910> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
just manually adjust my temperature and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.910 
just manually adjust my temperature and
tint<00:02:48.360> until<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.959> got<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.230> white<00:02:49.709> balance

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
tint until I got the right white balance

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
tint until I got the right white balance
that<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.400> looking<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.630> gonna<00:02:51.720> go

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that I was looking for so I'm gonna go

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.400 
that I was looking for so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.000> warm<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.540> bit<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.989> then

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
ahead and warm this up a bit and then

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.880 
ahead and warm this up a bit and then
add<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> little<00:02:55.950> bit<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.220> green<00:02:56.519> back<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
add a little bit of green back in so

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.470 
add a little bit of green back in so
once<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.430> your<00:02:59.579> white<00:02:59.819> balance<00:03:00.030> kind<00:03:00.390> of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
once you have your white balance kind of

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.729 
once you have your white balance kind of
figure<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.720> out<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.410> move<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
figure it out then you move to the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.800 
figure it out then you move to the
second<00:03:02.130> step<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.459> your<00:03:02.579> workflow<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.599> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
second step in your workflow and that is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.410 
second step in your workflow and that is
this<00:03:04.049> middle<00:03:04.410> set<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.099> sliders<00:03:05.579> starting<00:03:06.299> with

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
this middle set of sliders starting with

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.229 
this middle set of sliders starting with
exposure<00:03:06.840> ending<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.590> blacks<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:09.000> also

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
exposure ending with blacks and you also

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.420 
exposure ending with blacks and you also
have<00:03:09.540> an<00:03:09.690> auto<00:03:09.930> adjustment<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.920> all<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.280> those

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
have an auto adjustment for all of those

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.979 
have an auto adjustment for all of those
so<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> were<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> click<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.510> what

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
so if you were to click on that what

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.479 
so if you were to click on that what
it'll<00:03:13.170> do<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.590> something<00:03:13.799> very<00:03:14.099> similar<00:03:14.370> to

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
it'll do is something very similar to

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.629 
it'll do is something very similar to
the<00:03:14.700> white<00:03:14.849> balance<00:03:15.090> auto<00:03:16.069> option<00:03:17.069> which<00:03:17.459> is

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
the white balance auto option which is

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.640 
the white balance auto option which is
look<00:03:17.819> at<00:03:17.940> all<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.239> your<00:03:18.359> image<00:03:18.600> data<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.079> try

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
look at all of your image data and try

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.220 
look at all of your image data and try
and<00:03:19.799> make<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.069> best<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:21.359> know<00:03:21.450> suggestions

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
and make the best you know suggestions

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.259 
and make the best you know suggestions
for<00:03:22.590> each<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.010> these<00:03:23.100> sliders<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.060> for

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
for each one of these sliders so for

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.720 
for each one of these sliders so for
example<00:03:24.660> if<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.840> click<00:03:25.079> on<00:03:25.200> auto<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.769> can<00:03:26.519> see

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
example if I click on auto you can see

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.340 
example if I click on auto you can see
that<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:26.970> made<00:03:27.120> adjustments<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.750> those<00:03:27.930> middle

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
that it made adjustments to those middle

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.370 
that it made adjustments to those middle
set<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.680> sliders<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:30.209> overexposed<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.319> it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
set of sliders and it overexposed so it

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.809 
set of sliders and it overexposed so it
didn't<00:03:31.650> nail<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:31.889> but<00:03:32.220> definitely<00:03:32.340> try<00:03:32.760> it

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
didn't nail it but definitely try it

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.069 
didn't nail it but definitely try it
with<00:03:32.970> your<00:03:33.060> photographs<00:03:33.510> because<00:03:33.690> sometimes

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
with your photographs because sometimes

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.390 
with your photographs because sometimes
it's<00:03:34.260> right<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.709> money<00:03:34.739> or<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.160> gets<00:03:35.250> you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
it's right on the money or it gets you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.890 
it's right on the money or it gets you
really<00:03:35.670> close<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.389> just<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> make

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
really close and you just have to make

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.949 
really close and you just have to make
kind<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.530> micro<00:03:37.859> adjustments<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:39.389> this<00:03:39.750> case

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
kind of micro adjustments in this case

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.229 
kind of micro adjustments in this case
it<00:03:40.260> again<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.190> overexposed<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.060> I'm<00:03:42.150> gonna

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
it again it overexposed so I'm gonna

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.059 
it again it overexposed so I'm gonna
bring<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:42.569> down<00:03:42.780> closer<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.290> probably<00:03:43.799> half

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
bring this down closer to probably half

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.569 
bring this down closer to probably half
a<00:03:44.250> stop<00:03:44.540> yeah<00:03:45.540> somewhere<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:45.989> there<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.579> and

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
a stop yeah somewhere in there and and

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.099 
a stop yeah somewhere in there and and
then<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.180> contrast<00:03:48.600> slider<00:03:48.750> which

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
then you have your contrast slider which

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:49.879 
then you have your contrast slider which
I<00:03:49.230> think<00:03:49.380> most<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.680> are<00:03:49.799> probably

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
I think most of you are probably

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.559 
I think most of you are probably
familiar<00:03:50.100> with<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:50.940> your<00:03:51.120> highlights

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
familiar with you have your highlights

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.330 
familiar with you have your highlights
and<00:03:51.810> shadows<00:03:51.840> which<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> gradient<00:03:53.010> of

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and shadows which is the gradient of

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.640 
and shadows which is the gradient of
lights<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.850> darks<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.660> can<00:03:54.870> for<00:03:55.620> example

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
lights and darks so you can for example

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.830 
lights and darks so you can for example
shadows<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.519> can<00:03:56.549> boost<00:03:57.060> those<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.389> bit<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
shadows you can boost those a bit and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.490 
shadows you can boost those a bit and
bring<00:03:57.989> some<00:03:58.170> luminosity<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.769> them<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
bring some luminosity to them and you

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.229 
bring some luminosity to them and you
also<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.980> pure<00:04:02.430> whites<00:04:02.609> and<00:04:02.819> pure<00:04:03.030> black

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
also have pure whites and pure black

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.449 
also have pure whites and pure black
adjustments<00:04:04.019> here<00:04:04.260> too<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.859> same<00:04:05.250> kind<00:04:05.430> of

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
adjustments here too so same kind of

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.849 
adjustments here too so same kind of
thing<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:06.109> darken<00:04:07.109> your<00:04:07.139> blacks<00:04:07.470> further

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
thing you can darken your blacks further

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.430 
thing you can darken your blacks further
etc<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.569> second<00:04:10.019> step<00:04:10.169> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
etc and that is the second step and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.819 
etc and that is the second step and
middle<00:04:10.799> set<00:04:11.069> of<00:04:11.280> sliders<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:12.720> Camera<00:04:13.200> Raw<00:04:13.230> and

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
middle set of sliders in Camera Raw and

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.879 
middle set of sliders in Camera Raw and
then<00:04:14.790> lastly<00:04:15.269> are<00:04:15.599> these<00:04:15.840> last<00:04:16.139> set<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.500> three

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
then lastly are these last set of three

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.680 
then lastly are these last set of three
sliders<00:04:17.190> down<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.729> at<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.880> bottom<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.510> we

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
sliders down here at the bottom and we

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.899 
sliders down here at the bottom and we
have<00:04:18.810> clarity<00:04:19.229> vibrance<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.979> saturation<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
have clarity vibrance and saturation and

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.810 
have clarity vibrance and saturation and
I<00:04:21.299> love<00:04:21.570> clarity<00:04:22.169> clarity<00:04:22.349> is<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:23.010> contrast

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
I love clarity clarity is like contrast

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.500 
I love clarity clarity is like contrast
but<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.210> only<00:04:24.390> works<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.900> mid

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
but it only works on mid

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.230 
but it only works on mid
not<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.020> entire<00:04:26.440> image<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.430> for<00:04:27.610> example<00:04:28.030> if<00:04:28.120> I

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
not the entire image so for example if I

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.480 
not the entire image so for example if I
were<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.390> crank<00:04:28.810> clarity<00:04:29.380> up<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:30.070> can<00:04:30.220> start

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
were to crank clarity up you can start

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.550 
were to crank clarity up you can start
to<00:04:30.580> see<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.880> brick<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.510> some<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.500> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
to see the brick and some of the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.470 
to see the brick and some of the
wrinkles<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.400> different<00:04:33.760> textures<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.210> her

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
wrinkles and different textures and her

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.200 
wrinkles and different textures and her
shirts<00:04:34.840> start<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.320> really<00:04:35.560> pop<00:04:35.950> however<00:04:36.880> as

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
shirts start to really pop however as

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.300 
shirts start to really pop however as
you<00:04:37.780> can<00:04:37.900> also<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.230> one<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> side<00:04:38.980> effects

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
you can also see one of the side effects

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.370 
you can also see one of the side effects
of<00:04:39.490> clarity<00:04:39.940> especially<00:04:40.450> for<00:04:40.690> women's<00:04:41.080> skin

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
of clarity especially for women's skin

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.260 
of clarity especially for women's skin

tone now women's skin tone generally in

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.090 
tone now women's skin tone generally in
photographs<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:43.930> want<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.170> to<00:04:44.230> be<00:04:44.350> soft<00:04:44.680> and

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
photographs you want it to be soft and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.850 
photographs you want it to be soft and
more<00:04:45.460> glowing<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.150> not<00:04:46.270> harsh<00:04:46.660> but<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.740> can

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
more glowing and not harsh but you can

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.100 
more glowing and not harsh but you can
see<00:04:48.010> that<00:04:48.160> clarity<00:04:48.640> doesn't<00:04:49.450> really<00:04:49.600> work<00:04:49.870> for

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
see that clarity doesn't really work for

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.680 
see that clarity doesn't really work for
for<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.650> female<00:04:51.040> skin<00:04:51.400> tone<00:04:51.640> however<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:52.660> a

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
for a female skin tone however for a

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.960 
for a female skin tone however for a
male<00:04:53.020> skin<00:04:53.410> tone<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:54.070> make<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.520> work<00:04:54.700> or

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
male skin tone you can make it work or

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.940 
male skin tone you can make it work or
at<00:04:55.090> least<00:04:55.300> men<00:04:55.660> who<00:04:55.840> have<00:04:56.050> like<00:04:56.230> stubble<00:04:56.770> or

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
at least men who have like stubble or

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.280 
at least men who have like stubble or
beards<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.520> can<00:04:57.640> really<00:04:57.940> make<00:04:58.180> those<00:04:58.390> kind<00:04:59.230> of

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
beards you can really make those kind of

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.660 
beards you can really make those kind of
come<00:04:59.470> out<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.620> interesting<00:05:00.190> ways<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:00.640> a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
come out and interesting ways like a

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.570 
come out and interesting ways like a
dragon<00:05:01.120> effect<00:05:01.650> when<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.770> use<00:05:02.950> clarity<00:05:03.490> in

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
dragon effect when you use clarity in

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.860 
dragon effect when you use clarity in
those<00:05:03.700> areas<00:05:04.180> but<00:05:04.330> again<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.690> have<00:05:04.720> to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
those areas but again you have to

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.860 
those areas but again you have to
isolate<00:05:05.140> it<00:05:05.730> so<00:05:06.730> think<00:05:07.300> about<00:05:07.480> how<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.690> want

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
isolate it so think about how you want

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.720 
isolate it so think about how you want
to<00:05:07.990> use<00:05:08.050> clarity<00:05:08.650> for<00:05:08.860> your<00:05:09.010> photographs<00:05:09.490> if

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
to use clarity for your photographs if

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.400 
to use clarity for your photographs if
you<00:05:09.910> want<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.150> use<00:05:10.270> it<00:05:10.420> at<00:05:10.540> all<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:10.930> then<00:05:11.290> on

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
you want to use it at all and then on

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.900 
you want to use it at all and then on
the<00:05:11.530> other<00:05:11.560> end<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:11.950> clarity<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.520> starts<00:05:12.790> to

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
the other end of clarity it starts to

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.990 
the other end of clarity it starts to
soften<00:05:13.120> everything<00:05:13.420> and<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:15.400> can<00:05:15.520> see<00:05:15.760> the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
soften everything and you can see the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.760 
soften everything and you can see the
extreme<00:05:16.480> on<00:05:16.690> how<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:17.290> works

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
extreme on how that works

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.010 
extreme on how that works
so<00:05:18.160> that's<00:05:18.340> clarity<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:19.300> play<00:05:19.480> around<00:05:19.600> with<00:05:19.810> it

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
so that's clarity so play around with it

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.260 
so that's clarity so play around with it
see<00:05:20.230> how<00:05:20.350> it<00:05:20.440> works<00:05:20.620> for<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:20.980> and<00:05:21.220> then<00:05:21.760> second

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
see how it works for you and then second

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.840 
see how it works for you and then second
is<00:05:22.420> vibrance<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.320> vibrance<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.460> pretty<00:05:24.670> cool

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
is vibrance and vibrance is pretty cool

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.990 
is vibrance and vibrance is pretty cool
it<00:05:25.090> boosts<00:05:25.860> saturation<00:05:26.860> but<00:05:27.250> only<00:05:27.520> with<00:05:27.790> like

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
it boosts saturation but only with like

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.180 
it boosts saturation but only with like
lower<00:05:28.300> saturated<00:05:28.990> colors<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.710> won't<00:05:29.920> turn

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
lower saturated colors it won't turn

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.790 
lower saturated colors it won't turn
skin<00:05:30.610> orange<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.270> over<00:05:31.900> saturate<00:05:32.470> things

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
skin orange and over saturate things

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.890 
skin orange and over saturate things
like<00:05:33.130> if<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:34.120> were<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.360> just<00:05:34.570> use<00:05:34.750> the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
like if you were to just use the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.970 
like if you were to just use the
saturation<00:05:35.380> slider

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
saturation slider

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.340 
saturation slider
so<00:05:36.370> for<00:05:36.610> example<00:05:36.670> with<00:05:37.180> vibrance<00:05:37.930> if<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.200> were

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
so for example with vibrance if I were

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.590 
so for example with vibrance if I were
to<00:05:38.560> start<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.340> slide<00:05:39.610> it<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.090> right<00:05:40.300> you

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
to start to slide it to the right you

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.750 
to start to slide it to the right you
can<00:05:40.990> see<00:05:41.170> that<00:05:41.320> it's<00:05:41.410> starting<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:41.740> boost<00:05:42.070> the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
can see that it's starting to boost the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.580 
can see that it's starting to boost the
blues<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.570> different<00:05:43.870> colors<00:05:44.170> and<00:05:44.200> her

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
blues and the different colors and her

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.060 
blues and the different colors and her
clothing<00:05:45.100> in<00:05:45.250> a<00:05:45.580> real<00:05:45.760> nice<00:05:45.970> way<00:05:46.890> I'm<00:05:47.890> going<00:05:48.010> to

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
clothing in a real nice way I'm going to

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.640 
clothing in a real nice way I'm going to
go<00:05:48.160> ahead<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.460> bring<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:49.030> back<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.300> zero<00:05:49.780> and

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
go ahead and bring that back to zero and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.730 
go ahead and bring that back to zero and
then<00:05:51.100> saturation<00:05:51.940> saturation<00:05:52.240> is<00:05:53.050> basically

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
then saturation saturation is basically

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.790 
then saturation saturation is basically
you<00:05:54.670> know<00:05:54.700> color<00:05:55.210> intensity<00:05:55.900> across<00:05:56.440> all

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
you know color intensity across all

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.950 
you know color intensity across all
channels<00:05:56.850> so<00:05:57.850> you<00:05:57.910> can<00:05:58.120> do<00:05:58.240> some<00:05:58.420> crazy<00:05:58.600> things

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
channels so you can do some crazy things

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.930 
channels so you can do some crazy things
with<00:05:59.110> saturation<00:05:59.770> a<00:05:59.980> little<00:06:00.760> bit<00:06:00.850> of

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
with saturation a little bit of

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.370 
with saturation a little bit of
saturation<00:06:01.090> generally<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:01.990> looks<00:06:02.140> pretty

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
saturation generally it looks pretty

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.260 
saturation generally it looks pretty
good<00:06:02.560> but<00:06:02.890> then<00:06:03.010> if<00:06:03.100> you<00:06:03.220> want<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.430> get<00:06:03.610> you

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
good but then if you want to get you

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.350 
good but then if you want to get you
know<00:06:04.300> kind<00:06:04.660> of<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.140> circus<00:06:05.560> look<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.360> start

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
know kind of that circus look and start

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.030 
know kind of that circus look and start
to<00:06:07.510> make<00:06:07.600> oranges<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.290> things<00:06:08.440> like<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:08.620> pop

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
to make oranges and things like that pop

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.980 
to make oranges and things like that pop
then<00:06:09.490> you<00:06:09.580> just<00:06:09.790> crank<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.090> all<00:06:10.180> the<00:06:10.240> way<00:06:10.360> so

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
then you just crank it all the way so

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.100 
then you just crank it all the way so
that's<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.680> basic<00:06:12.370> sliders<00:06:13.180> within<00:06:13.690> Camera

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
that's the basic sliders within Camera

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.620 
that's the basic sliders within Camera
Raw<00:06:14.290> and<00:06:14.560> that<00:06:15.220> is<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.520> typical<00:06:15.970> workflow<00:06:16.180> for

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
Raw and that is the typical workflow for

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.900 
Raw and that is the typical workflow for
most<00:06:16.810> photographers<00:06:17.190> if<00:06:18.190> you're<00:06:18.400> wanting<00:06:18.880> to

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
most photographers if you're wanting to

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.820 
most photographers if you're wanting to
do<00:06:19.120> more<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.750> do<00:06:19.990> more<00:06:20.200> advanced<00:06:20.560> stuff

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
do more and do more advanced stuff

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.980 
do more and do more advanced stuff
within<00:06:21.070> Camera<00:06:21.520> Raw<00:06:21.640> then<00:06:22.090> go<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.420> the<00:06:22.690> next
