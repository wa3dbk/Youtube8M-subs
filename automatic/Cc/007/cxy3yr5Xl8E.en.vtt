00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.250
 Flower places come here today 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.490
 with an unboxing area and that of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.350

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.439
 on my channel and although it is today 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.830
 to corsa vengeance memory in 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.890
 then the speech therapy here we see 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.980
 already two versions of the profile and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.010
 Although we have black and jetblue 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.260
 Upper Austria called both versions now 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.860
 with 8 gigabytes leaving me in the end 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.000
 16 gb in total can fall back in 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.980
 a tower yes I think there are some 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.850
 unboxing and how you can puke 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.240
 logo case frame is out there today 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.680
 rough on box or unpacked there 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.260
 he pushes the black times to 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.180
 page and we are now looking at the first 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.170
 packaging 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.040
 and here we see a few 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.799
 information that here two times four gb 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.049
 Included in this packaging are here 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.009
 also to see the ramps themselves 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.740
 with the jeans lettering on an intel 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.990
 board here and also to see that this 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.560
 RAM also for AMD systems 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.390
 suitable but above all things for 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.899
 stand-alone systems 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:37.780
 from the first to the third 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:42.889
 generation gigabyte ddr3 that a 1600s 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.149
 1600 megahertz modules and at the side 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:47.450
 there is nothing now 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.729
 what is the importance of their upper 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 and bottom just as well and here on the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.030
 back we see because already 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.469
 few information there so me now 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.749
 get closer so here are some now 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:03.259
 information given in different 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:05.329
 Spoken here in German so everyone 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.720
 if it does not happen here ten years 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.420
 warranty but are core series of 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.290
 that a high speed one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.260
 Best stability and compatibility with 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.080
 this lob profi works memory pulls 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.099
 So one can be called if we have one 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.980
 have air cooler and there this 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.629
 army spokesman would like to block that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.670
 without problems in contrast 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.720
 to the precursors the normal corsa 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.970
 vengeance of a very high heat sink 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.329
 had and here we will see 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.370
 already working memory in a small 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.400
 Sichtfenster and I think we pack 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.989
 the good piece out after opening 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.090
 We have this content of the packaging 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.170
 See this little one once 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.959
 half with the world games defect 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.489
 the information in german said and 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.950
 of course the memory module 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:07.659
 even individually packed in one 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:10.989
 plastic bag pack this job makes 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.690
 So here's the first one, the second one 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.489
 do not unpack the same here 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.870
 we see green pcp at this 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.620
 memory is at the black 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.780
 the pcb then also green because only at 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.780
 the white so this contract 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.780
 is there even in white there it is 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:34.230
 pcb then black yes here the blue then 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.879
 The bodies look very high quality 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.980
 is my first corsa memory 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.629
 so I do not know like that now 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.879
 predecessors were the ones with the big one 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.799
 heat sink writes me the second time 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.239
 the comments what you learn so what 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.040
 you have had such an experience with 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:56.230
 this memory yes the corset 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.260
 people too low profile logo here and 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.019
 on the back than a punk madsen 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:07.720
 information that it is eight gigabytes 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:14.800
 are so twice 4 gb with the 1600 more 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:18.730
 has and the latencies of 9 9 9 24 15 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.530
 do you still want the product name 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.300
 if you are in your mainboard 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.890
 handbook will look anyway 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.950
 mostly these numbers indicated the 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.750
 upper and not the name he 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.320
 maybe in a respective shop 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.220
 one side will find a small one 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.180
 Edge times to see if the so massive 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.830
 will fail 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.090
 if now the memory built in 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 is and yes I think that was salt 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.500
 his 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.600
 I'm going to test you a tree times 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.310
 still very so far makes you so 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.550
 yes kingston where in there and you look like 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.960
 who are of stability and me 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.270
 would say a few more follow 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.670
 Pictures of this corsa vengeance ilo 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.280
 Profi RAM also the black 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.440
 if a publisher is running and now 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.850
 it has been an author 's man to the point 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.850
 next time a ship 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.409
 red 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.910
 prof
