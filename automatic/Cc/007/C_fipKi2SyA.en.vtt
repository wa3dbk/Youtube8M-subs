00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.560
 Permeability is created 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 from carolin of space to space and can 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.780
 in the other direction, that is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.130
 scary transparent communicative it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.380
 history of spatial impression is here 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.979
 the reader yard looks to the end 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.020
 those are the highlights we are very 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.390
 glad that a project has been ours now 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 has accompanied five years of strength 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 a lot of time has finally cost to one 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.240
 positive end comes the next days 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.860
 It will not be without a big project 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.869
 but we are happy 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.210
 on the time after, if beautiful here 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.979
 good job opportunities in the center of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 a personal favorite place or 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.739
 place here almost insist on mine 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.930
 favorite place in this atrium high and 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.090
 a library holds the daylight 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.099
 is illuminated where today where we see 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.659

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.730

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.260

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.610

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.930
 we will do it all and how 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.430
 many people came that was all 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.840
 Surprised that so much audience here 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.579
 is and how big the premises 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.409
 I am overwhelmed from the middle 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.410
