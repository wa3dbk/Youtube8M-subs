an<00:02:05.219> alternative<00:02:05.759> band<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.240> normally<00:02:06.659> I'd<00:02:06.750> be

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
an alternative band so normally I'd be

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.779 
an alternative band so normally I'd be
like<00:02:07.079> no<00:02:07.530> definitely<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.549> I<00:02:08.580> actually

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
like no definitely not but I actually

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309 
like no definitely not but I actually
listen<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> track<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.660> figured<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.200> out

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
listen to the track and figured it out

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.960 
listen to the track and figured it out
but<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.190> soon<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.459> listened<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.849> was

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
but as soon as I listened to it I was

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.610 
but as soon as I listened to it I was
like<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.390> definitely<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.840> tutorial<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
like this is definitely a tutorial that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
like this is definitely a tutorial that
should<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.069> done<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:15.180> even<00:02:15.450> though<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
should be done because even though it is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.910 
should be done because even though it is
technically<00:02:16.590> an<00:02:16.739> alternative<00:02:17.340> song<00:02:18.920> it's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
technically an alternative song it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.470 
technically an alternative song it's
completely<00:02:20.610> different<00:02:20.730> from<00:02:20.940> anything<00:02:21.120> we've

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
completely different from anything we've

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.160

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
done in any other tutorials but there's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.509 
done in any other tutorials but there's
a<00:02:25.230> lot<00:02:25.349> of<00:02:25.379> fingering<00:02:25.829> techniques<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
a lot of fingering techniques on the
