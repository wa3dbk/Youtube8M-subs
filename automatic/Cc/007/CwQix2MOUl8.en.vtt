00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.160
 our project is focused on the branch 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.619
 of home automation is an intercom that 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.269
 opens a door through a 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.650
 mobile device with operating system 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.160
 André 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.320
 the members are javi gonzález tíos 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.320
 with a script by ti martínez 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.880
 in the beginning we have to configure the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.690
 application with the user the password 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.330
 and the url of the raspberry to turn 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.490
 the service is lifted so that you listen 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.230
 the mobile requests and they are configured 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.890
 the pins needed to open the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.960
 door 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 once we hear the bell of the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 door we have the need to open it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.210
 we can do this now through 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.440
 our smartphone we only give to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.440
 open door 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.030
 this sends a signal to give to the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.970
 raspberry pi where they are indicating 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 that someone wants to open the door is 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.880
 verify the user in the database 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.079
 and if it's right open the door 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.549
 through the interruptions of the gp and 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.500
 after he opened the door he saves 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.630
 a history in the database with the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.310
 date the time and the user who opened the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 door 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.049
 let's see how it works 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.100
 With so many 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.530
 yes 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.500
 3 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.650
 OK OK 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.229
 do not get 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 if you want what you do including 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.840
 to this data that is already for
