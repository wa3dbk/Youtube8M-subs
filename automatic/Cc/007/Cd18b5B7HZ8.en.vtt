00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
coming through as you're doing your
navigation<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.300> I'm<00:04:26.510> going<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.660> go<00:04:26.780> ahead<00:04:26.810> and

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
navigation so I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.780 
navigation so I'm going to go ahead and
have<00:04:27.139> somebody<00:04:27.560> call<00:04:27.919> me<00:04:28.070> right<00:04:28.280> now<00:04:28.520> and

have somebody call me right now and
we'll<00:04:29.389> see<00:04:29.660> how<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.320> takes<00:04:30.740> it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.380 

so<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.260> interrupts<00:04:42.920> navigation<00:04:43.490> go<00:04:44.180> ahead<00:04:44.360> and

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
so it interrupts navigation go ahead and

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.060 
so it interrupts navigation go ahead and

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
are navigating all via hands-free if you

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.360 
are navigating all via hands-free if you
have<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.600> bluetooth<00:05:08.810> headset<00:05:09.080> connected<00:05:09.770> it'll

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
have a bluetooth headset connected it'll

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.580 
have a bluetooth headset connected it'll
be<00:05:10.460> routed<00:05:10.850> right<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.810> bluetooth<00:05:12.320> and

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
be routed right to the bluetooth and

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.560 
be routed right to the bluetooth and
then<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.160> call<00:05:13.400> will<00:05:13.670> end<00:05:13.910> when<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.360> call

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
then the call will end when the call

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.380 
then the call will end when the call
ends<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.650> from<00:05:16.040> a<00:05:16.190> phone<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.790> navigation

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
ends so from a phone and a navigation

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.060 
ends so from a phone and a navigation
standpoint<00:05:17.930> you're<00:05:18.620> not<00:05:18.710> going<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.920> get<00:05:19.010> a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
standpoint you're not going to get a

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.640 
standpoint you're not going to get a
better<00:05:19.220> standalone<00:05:20.080> navigator<00:05:21.080> than<00:05:21.290> garmin

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
better standalone navigator than garmin

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.010 
better standalone navigator than garmin
and<00:05:21.800> that<00:05:22.310> same<00:05:22.580> philosophy<00:05:23.510> follows<00:05:23.810> through

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
and that same philosophy follows through

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.870 
and that same philosophy follows through
to<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:25.010> phone<00:05:25.190> or<00:05:25.400> not<00:05:25.520> going<00:05:25.670> to<00:05:25.730> get<00:05:25.850> a
