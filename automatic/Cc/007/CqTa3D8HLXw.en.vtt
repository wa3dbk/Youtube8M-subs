too<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.250> also<00:01:53.430> hop<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> chair<00:01:54.090> get

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
too they can also hop in the chair get

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.880 
too they can also hop in the chair get
their<00:01:54.600> fillings<00:01:54.899> done<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.409> leave<00:01:55.590> without

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
their fillings done and leave without

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
their fillings done and leave without
having<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.909> um<00:01:57.210> lip<00:01:57.450> or<00:01:57.630> tongue<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.649> you're

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
having an um lip or tongue so you're

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920 
having an um lip or tongue so you're
actually<00:01:59.070> doing<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.759> drilling<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:00.509> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
actually doing the drilling right now so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.660 
actually doing the drilling right now so
immediately<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.130> our<00:02:02.159> patients

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
immediately we just put our patients

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.240 
immediately we just put our patients
down<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.509> started<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.590> Zach<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:05.070> going

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
down and get started so Zach I'm going

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.679 
down and get started so Zach I'm going
to<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.490> water<00:02:05.850> again<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> take<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.509> all

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to use my water again to take out all

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.389 
to use my water again to take out all
the<00:02:06.899> decay<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> sugar<00:02:07.920> bug<00:02:08.160> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the decay which are the sugar bug that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.550 
the decay which are the sugar bug that
your<00:02:09.060> tooth<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> sure<00:02:10.229> bugs<00:02:10.530> which<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
your tooth so the sure bugs which is a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.710 
your tooth so the sure bugs which is a
and<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:12.190> doctor<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.819> your<00:02:13.000> tooth<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.569> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and the doctor on your tooth is like a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.830 
and the doctor on your tooth is like a
blue<00:02:13.930> key<00:02:14.110> type<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.069> material<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.880> because<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
blue key type of material and because of

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.690 
blue key type of material and because of
this<00:02:17.140> there's<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.770> lot<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.920> inspection<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
this there's a lot of inspection in the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
this there's a lot of inspection in the
tooth<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.290> eventually<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.739> leave

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
tooth and eventually if you just leave

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.440 
tooth and eventually if you just leave
the<00:02:21.130> decay<00:02:21.430> there<00:02:21.670> which<00:02:21.880> happens<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> lot

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the decay there which happens to a lot

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.570 
the decay there which happens to a lot
of<00:02:22.569> patients<00:02:23.020> because<00:02:23.200> they're<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.590> scared<00:02:24.040> to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
of patients because they're so scared to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.820 
of patients because they're so scared to
come<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.000> office<00:02:25.200> they<00:02:26.200> end<00:02:26.380> up<00:02:26.500> needing<00:02:26.620> a

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
come to the office they end up needing a

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.070 
come to the office they end up needing a
root<00:02:27.069> canal<00:02:27.220> which<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.940> lot<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.150> times<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.750> don't

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
root canal which a lot of times we don't

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.140 
root canal which a lot of times we don't
want<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.380> have<00:02:29.470> root<00:02:29.800> now<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
want to have root now so this is the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.470 
want to have root now so this is the
best<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.840> easiest<00:02:32.620> way<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.099> prevention<00:02:33.730> to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
best and easiest way of prevention to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.089 
best and easiest way of prevention to
take<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> decay<00:02:35.110> out<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.739> earlier

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
take the decay out and it's earlier

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.820 
take the decay out and it's earlier
stage<00:02:36.519> without<00:02:37.180> having<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.750> get<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> shot<00:02:38.200> so

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
stage without having to get a shot so

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.870 
stage without having to get a shot so
the<00:02:39.459> labor<00:02:39.849> is<00:02:41.099> inside<00:02:42.099> this<00:02:42.280> machine<00:02:42.459> here

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
the labor is inside this machine here

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.840 
the labor is inside this machine here
and<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.870> comes<00:02:44.200> out<00:02:44.470> as<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> beam<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.340> white<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
and it comes out as a beam of white and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.150 
and it comes out as a beam of white and
breaks<00:02:46.450> off<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.900> water<00:02:47.110> molecule<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.920> water

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
breaks off the water molecule the water

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.090 
breaks off the water molecule the water
so<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.090> noise<00:02:49.269> right<00:02:49.510> there<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.440> beam

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
so that noise right there is is the beam

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.870 
so that noise right there is is the beam
yes<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.450> yeah<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.380> zapping<00:02:53.739> sound<00:02:53.980> fit<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
yes so yeah the zapping sound fit and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.120 
yes so yeah the zapping sound fit and
you<00:02:54.940> don't<00:02:55.120> feel<00:02:55.269> anything<00:02:55.330> right<00:02:55.750> Zach

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
you don't feel anything right Zach

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.410 
you don't feel anything right Zach
doesn't<00:02:57.130> hurt<00:02:57.340> at<00:02:57.459> all<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.840> actuality<00:03:00.420> so

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
doesn't hurt at all so in actuality so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.240 
doesn't hurt at all so in actuality so
the<00:03:01.630> water<00:03:01.840> lace<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> high<00:03:02.890> power

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the water lace is like a high power

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.270 
the water lace is like a high power
water<00:03:03.549> Sun<00:03:04.030> or<00:03:04.360> host<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:05.410> chips<00:03:05.769> away<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
water Sun or host that chips away the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.949 
water Sun or host that chips away the
decay<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:08.130> ends<00:03:09.130> up<00:03:09.250> removing<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.030> decay<00:03:10.360> so

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
decay and ends up removing the decay so

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.900 
decay and ends up removing the decay so
what's<00:03:11.260> really<00:03:11.620> nice<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.760> have<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
what's really nice is you can have a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.720 
what's really nice is you can have a
very<00:03:13.209> conservative<00:03:14.010> restoration<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.579> by

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
very conservative restoration just by

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.420 
very conservative restoration just by
using<00:03:15.910> water<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.359> take<00:03:16.720> out<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.019> cavity<00:03:17.430> once

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
using water to take out the cavity once

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.390 
using water to take out the cavity once
I<00:03:18.640> know<00:03:18.700> I'm<00:03:19.060> back<00:03:19.600> into<00:03:19.959> hard<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.920> structure

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
I know I'm back into hard to structure

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.699 
I know I'm back into hard to structure
that<00:03:21.640> means<00:03:21.820> we<00:03:21.970> removed<00:03:22.420> all<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.930> cavity

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
that means we removed all of the cavity

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.900 
that means we removed all of the cavity
which<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:24.790> great<00:03:25.359> Zach<00:03:26.260> are<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.500> doing<00:03:26.680> ok<00:03:26.950> ok

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
which is great Zach are you doing ok ok

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.940 
which is great Zach are you doing ok ok
so<00:03:28.450> all<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.780> cavity<00:03:29.170> is<00:03:29.230> gone<00:03:29.410> because<00:03:29.680> now<00:03:29.920> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
so all the cavity is gone because now I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.479 
so all the cavity is gone because now I
have<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.160> rock<00:03:30.700> solid<00:03:31.269> hard<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.340> Kenny's<00:03:33.340> gone

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
have a rock solid hard to Kenny's gone

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.940 
have a rock solid hard to Kenny's gone
the<00:03:33.819> cavity<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.239> all<00:03:34.420> gone<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.650> now<00:03:35.799> we're

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
the cavity is all gone so now we're

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.770 
the cavity is all gone so now we're
halfway<00:03:36.130> done<00:03:36.310> now<00:03:36.760> we're<00:03:36.940> halfway<00:03:37.150> done<00:03:37.359> bad

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
halfway done now we're halfway done bad

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.720 
halfway done now we're halfway done bad
parts<00:03:38.140> gone<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.859> now<00:03:39.040> we<00:03:39.100> have<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.400> seal<00:03:39.579> it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
parts gone and now we have to seal it

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.729 
parts gone and now we have to seal it
this<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.209> easiest<00:03:40.750> part<00:03:41.049> this<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.230> sealing

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
this is the easiest part this is sealing

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.500 
this is the easiest part this is sealing
apart<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:42.730> we're<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.120> paint<00:03:43.389> your

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
apart so that we're gonna paint your

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.240 
apart so that we're gonna paint your
tooth<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.930> four<00:03:44.109> different<00:03:44.530> layers<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.980> first

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
tooth and four different layers so first

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.470 
tooth and four different layers so first
what<00:03:45.370> we're<00:03:45.519> gonna<00:03:45.609> do<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.970> we're<00:03:46.090> gonna<00:03:46.180> use<00:03:46.450> a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.960 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a
material<00:03:46.690> called<00:03:46.959> etch<00:03:47.380> H<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:48.340> like<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.639> soap

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
material called etch H is like a soap

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.150 
material called etch H is like a soap
that<00:03:49.209> cleans<00:03:49.510> off<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> tooth<00:03:50.049> which<00:03:51.010> is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
that cleans off the tooth which is

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.680 
that cleans off the tooth which is
really<00:03:51.400> great<00:03:51.609> so<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.000> way<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.150> sterilize

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
really great so that way you sterilize

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.170 
really great so that way you sterilize
the<00:03:52.870> area<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.290> you're<00:03:53.410> working<00:03:53.799> on<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:55.090> so

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the area that you're working on it so

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.809 
the area that you're working on it so
that<00:03:55.209> way<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.450> can<00:03:55.660> ensure<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.230> your<00:03:56.380> cavity

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
that way you can ensure that your cavity

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.720 
that way you can ensure that your cavity
filling<00:03:57.819> is<00:03:57.970> going<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.019> last<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.500> lifetime

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
filling is going to last you a lifetime

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.039 
filling is going to last you a lifetime
so<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:00.910> leave<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.209> etch<00:04:01.329> on<00:04:01.510> just<00:04:01.810> for<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> few

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
so we leave the etch on just for a few

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.300 
so we leave the etch on just for a few
seconds<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.620> then<00:04:02.709> we<00:04:02.829> go<00:04:02.950> ahead<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.220> rinse

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
seconds and then we go ahead and rinse

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.760 
seconds and then we go ahead and rinse
so<00:04:06.310> now<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.580> second<00:04:07.090> layer<00:04:07.240> of<00:04:07.540> cute<00:04:07.770> material

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
so now the second layer of cute material

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.140 
so now the second layer of cute material
that<00:04:08.890> we're<00:04:09.040> going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.190> use<00:04:09.280> is<00:04:09.670> called<00:04:09.970> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
that we're going to use is called the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.900 
that we're going to use is called the
Prime<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.690> prime<00:04:10.930> is<00:04:11.170> what<00:04:11.290> kind<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.160> prepare

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
Prime the prime is what kind of prepare

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.370 
Prime the prime is what kind of prepare
the<00:04:13.120> tooth<00:04:13.300> structure<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.900> receive<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
the tooth structure to receive the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.130 
the tooth structure to receive the
composite<00:04:14.920> resin<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.850> in<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.120> past<00:04:16.330> we<00:04:16.720> used<00:04:16.750> a

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
composite resin so in the past we used a

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.130 
composite resin so in the past we used a
lot<00:04:17.350> of<00:04:17.670> dentists<00:04:18.670> used<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:19.000> lot<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.239> material

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
lot of dentists used a lot of material

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.720 
lot of dentists used a lot of material
called<00:04:20.350> silver<00:04:20.980> filling<00:04:21.370> which<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.610> that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
called silver filling which is that

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.360 
called silver filling which is that
amalgam<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.690> old<00:04:22.930> ugly<00:04:23.560> silver<00:04:23.920> fillings

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
amalgam the old ugly silver fillings

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.030 
amalgam the old ugly silver fillings
that<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.610> have<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:24.880> your<00:04:25.000> mouth<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:26.200> now<00:04:26.590> we're

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
that you have in your mouth so now we're

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.520 
that you have in your mouth so now we're
priming<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.610> such<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.780> first<00:04:28.990> layer<00:04:29.260> now

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
priming it such the first layer now

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.690 
priming it such the first layer now
we're<00:04:29.650> going<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.830> go<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.220> second<00:04:30.580> layer

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
we're going to go to the second layer

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.440 
we're going to go to the second layer
which<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:30.940> called<00:04:31.210> bond<00:04:31.540> bond<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.800> layer<00:04:33.450> that

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
which is called bond bond to layer that

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.320 
which is called bond bond to layer that
prepares<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.080> tooth<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.670> like<00:04:36.670> glue<00:04:37.030> that

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
prepares the tooth to like glue that

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.620 
prepares the tooth to like glue that
attaches<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.990> composite<00:04:38.590> resin<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.850> the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
attaches the composite resin to the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.990 
attaches the composite resin to the
tooth<00:04:40.960> structure<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.340> we<00:04:42.520> also<00:04:42.700> have

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
tooth structure and so we also have

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.730 
tooth structure and so we also have
something<00:04:43.390> we<00:04:43.480> call<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.810> magic<00:04:44.200> light<00:04:44.440> the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
something we call the magic light the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.430 
something we call the magic light the
blue<00:04:44.980> light<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.630> hardens<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.170> tooth

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
blue light and it hardens the tooth

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.070 
blue light and it hardens the tooth
surface<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.970> once<00:04:49.330> we<00:04:49.510> put<00:04:49.660> our<00:04:49.750> composite

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
surface so once we put our composite

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.020 
surface so once we put our composite
resin<00:04:50.530> in<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.650> starts<00:04:51.280> off<00:04:51.400> as<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.640> petty

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
resin in it starts off as a petty

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.530 
resin in it starts off as a petty
material<00:04:52.510> very<00:04:53.200> liquid<00:04:53.680> like<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.160> then<00:04:54.910> with

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
material very liquid like and then with

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.840 
material very liquid like and then with
the<00:04:55.660> magic<00:04:56.020> light<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.440> hardens<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.070> up<00:04:57.190> our

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
the magic light it hardens it up our

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.310 
the magic light it hardens it up our
most<00:04:58.090> dentists<00:04:58.480> office<00:04:58.810> gonna<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.170> this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
most dentists office gonna have this

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.590 
most dentists office gonna have this
