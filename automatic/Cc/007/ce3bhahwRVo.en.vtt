00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.650
Hey guys, Dr. Axe here, Doctor of Functional
Medicine and Nutritionist.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.460
Today I'm going to talk about how to overcome
adrenal fatigue.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.890
And so many people today struggle with adrenal
insufficiency, major fatigue issues, and it's

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.740
due to problems with the adrenal glands.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.040
And the adrenal glands are two sort of thumb-sized
organs that sit here in the back of your flank

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.930
area, and there are so many people, I would
say about 80% of the population that at some

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.320
point will struggle with adrenal fatigue at
some point in their life.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.290
And in this video I'm going to go through
the three steps you must follow if you want

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.390
to heal adrenal fatigue for good.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.410
And really it starts with diet.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.490
Actually, before I get into that though, let
me talk about warning signs you have adrenal

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.490
fatigue.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.890
Number one, if you struggle with fatigue,
even if you get enough sleep at night and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.100
the next day you wake up and you're still
tired, that is a major warning sign you have

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.470
adrenal fatigue.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.310
If you feel like you can just never catch
up or you're always tired, that's a warning

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.310
sign you have adrenal fatigue.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.820
If you feel overwhelmed and stressed, you
feel anxiety, those are warning signs you

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.820
have adrenal fatigue.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.530
If you have trouble focusing or concentrating
or poor memory, those are warning signs you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280
have adrenal fatigue or adrenal insufficiency.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.009
Also, if you have a thyroid issue, pretty
much every person that has a thyroid condition,

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.101
whether it's hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's or
Graves' disease, any of those issues, that

00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.189
probably means you do have an adrenal issue.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.000
And some other warning signs could be that
you are storing excess body fat.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.479
So if you have gone to the gym and you've
worked out for hours, and you're still not

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.060
losing weight like you think you should.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.060
Or you can't seem to lose that last five pounds
or break through that weight loss plateau,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.259
those are warning signs that you have adrenal
fatigue.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.399
And so step number one in healing adrenal
fatigue is changing your diet.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.380
The top foods you must get out of your diet
to heal your adrenal glands is number one,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.380
caffeine.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.210
If you're consuming loads and loads of coffee
on a regular basis and large amounts of caffeine,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.900
that will definitely burn out your adrenal
glands.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.730
The other thing is consuming too much sugar.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.329
Sugar will burn out your adrenal glands.

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.010
Hydrogenated oils in foods that are just stimulants,
like I've already mentioned, foods that really

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.200
imbalance blood sugar levels and will cause
spikes.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.670
But caffeine and sugar are the two biggies
that you need to get out of your diet.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.220
Now, the next thing here are the foods that
really support your adrenal glands.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.170
And foods that are high in Vitamin B-12 and
magnesium, also foods that help stabilize

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.840
blood sugar and energy levels.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.620
Coconut products, like coconut oil, coconut
milk, coconut meat, those are great for supporting

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.790
your adrenal glands.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.599
Olives are great, olives and olive oil.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.659
Raw dairy products and grass-fed butter are
fantastic, organic meats.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.040
Doing loads of vegetables, especially spinach,
kale, and chard are great for the adrenal

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
glands.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.170
Also, seaweed.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.930
Seaweed contains iodine along with other minerals
that can support the adrenal glands as well.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.120
And so, again, adding some of those foods
in your diet is a definite must in changing

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.120
your diet if you want to overcome adrenal
fatigue.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.440
Now, the second thing you need to do to heal
adrenal fatigue is take supplements that support

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.310
your adrenal glands, and there is a group
of herbs or roots called adaptogen or adaptogenic

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.120
herbs which include a family of things, like
ashwagandha, rhodiola, Holy Basil, licorice

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.859
root and ginseng.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.049
But adaptogen herbs are titled adaptogens
because they help your body adapt and deal

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.890
with stress, and these have big benefits.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.670
The number one you want to take, the number
one adaptogen for specifically your adrenals

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.599
and your thyroid is called ashwagandha.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.000
So you want to take ashwagandha, Holy Basil,
and licorice root.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.360
I believe are the most beneficial for supporting
your adrenal glands.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.870
Also, getting B Vitamins is very important
for your adrenal glands, especially Vitamin

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.870
B-12.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.670
But I recommend taking a high quality B Vitamin
complex supplement.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.139
And last but not least, magnesium, as well
as Vitamin D can also support your adrenals

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.720
and selenium.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.200
Selenium is a mineral that works as an antioxidant
that also supports the adrenal glands.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.530
So those are the most important nutrients
to support your adrenals in terms of the supplements.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.200
And last but not least, if you want to overcome
adrenal fatigue is you've got to lower your

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.280
overall stress levels.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.760
Step number one in lowering stress is getting
better quality sleep at night, sleeping 8

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.000
to 10 hours a night.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.970
The next step is if you are stressed out,
you've got to start working on removing the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.970
stressors.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.980
And I recommend you get out a sheet of paper,
write down all of those things that are causing

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.980
stress.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.980
Maybe it's your boss at work.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.290
Maybe it's your spouse doing something.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.530
Maybe it's something in your schedule.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.070
Really look and address and know what's stressing
you out, and then work on rectifying those

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.070
things.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.140
And you can't fix all forms of stress, but
if you can reduce, let's say, reduce your

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.880
stress by 50%, that alone will help you improve
your adrenal function and help heal your adrenal

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880
glands.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.570
And then schedule in times of fun and joy
in your schedule doing things you love to

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.210
do, that also can help you overcome adrenal
insufficiency.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.960
So, again, getting more sleep, reducing stress,
adding joy into your life.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.800
All of those things are going to help you
overcome adrenal fatigue.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.530
And also doing certain forms of exercise that
help reduce stress, like barre classes, Pilates,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.060
even going out for a jog.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.010
Whatever exercise for you, not overdoing it
but just light amounts of exercise 20 to 30

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.810
minutes several times a week.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.560
Going out, going for a walk, going out in
nature.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.810
All of those things that can reduce stress
are going to help you overcome adrenal fatigue.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.841
So remember, if you want to heal adrenal fatigue
or cure your adrenal fatigue fast, what I

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:12.960
recommend you do, number one, change your
diet.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.150
Get rid of the caffeine and sugar.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.160
Start loading up on those nutrient dense foods,
especially green leafy vegetables and healthy

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.030
fats, like coconut oil.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.770
Number two, take some good quality supplements,
like ashwagandha and other adaptogenic herbs.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.910
Also B Vitamins, and last but not least, reduce
stress.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.750
You follow those three steps, you are well
on your way to curing your adrenal fatigue

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.750
symptoms.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.590
