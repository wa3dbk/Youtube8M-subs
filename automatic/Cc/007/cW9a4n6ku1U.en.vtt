to<00:03:41.480> know<00:03:41.569> that<00:03:41.989> your<00:03:42.290> model<00:03:42.620> will<00:03:42.709> never<00:03:42.920> fly

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099

outside of your line of sight an
inherent<00:03:47.180> problem<00:03:47.480> with<00:03:47.629> most<00:03:47.840> gps<00:03:48.079> systems

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
inherent problem with most gps systems

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.619 
inherent problem with most gps systems
is<00:03:48.919> that<00:03:49.189> they<00:03:49.370> require<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.790> long<00:03:50.090> time<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.480> lock

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
is that they require a long time to lock

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.229 
is that they require a long time to lock
