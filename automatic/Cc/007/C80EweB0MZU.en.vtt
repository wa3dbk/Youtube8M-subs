00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.140
 Now every morning they confirmed a passive transport 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.099
 a kind of forum is the merger 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.649
 the deep sion is 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.649
 something very commonplace 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.410
 et al dente actually nothing else from a points victory parental leave 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.789
 equal 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.449
 what does that mean 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
 Let's say I'm here in this room 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 it had certain scent molecules 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.460
 someone with your ounces of Porsche comes into this room 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 and these scent molecules are around this person 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 over time a few ple 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.660
 53 these scent molecules on HUS throughout the room 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.830
 until the final space is distributed they are divided 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.350
 Now that is something very corrupt actually 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 this program image taken the merger 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.190
 except 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.550
 particle 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.990
 in a high concentration 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.580
 are at a certain point 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.840
 Yawning too under the burst where the concentration in Penzberg 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.110
 Kochan does not exist 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.230
 a little less high than in this region except these particles 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.610
 the phone 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.680
 Places which have a high concentration to burst the one low 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.590
 Have concentration 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 and her child once the whole place four is equally concentrated and the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.440
 particle 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.380
 Bankruptcies in the sense 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.670
 equal fat 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 they can not feel anymore now 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.100
 and why does that happen? 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 one imagines these particles in front of Pascal 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690
 this leaves very fine circles 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:13.299
 and randomly draws back and forth and that is called the Brownian Molko lag 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.359
 the Weko 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.480
 and these particles are now relocating the teats and Gucci is now losing revenue 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.509
 table 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.879
 they are cleaning at the traffic lights 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.129
 this concentration here protects so high and gives a bit ten new ones 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.699
 other table are 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.459
 now well argue particles with the officiate together and at the latest end 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.289
 Out 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:41.139
 and some time late and promptly ski these particles at the table so far 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.419
 In addition, all particles of cents are contained wrinkled 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.439
 which is not really important 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.839
 one percentage point 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.849
 Concentration- that's enough for you all 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.059
 best to understand with 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.879
 with a certain village 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.879
 for example, Porsche honored 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.379
 I hope that it brought something
