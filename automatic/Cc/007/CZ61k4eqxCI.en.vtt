00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
something that was fun for myself and my

something that was fun for myself and my
sisters<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.730> wrote<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:02.300> little<00:01:02.450> program

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
sisters and I wrote this little program

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.840 
sisters and I wrote this little program
then<00:01:03.500> basically<00:01:03.950> just<00:01:04.040> add<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.369> little<00:01:04.550> bit<00:01:04.699> to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
then basically just add a little bit to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.249 
then basically just add a little bit to
it<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.330> then<00:01:05.449> wanted<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.869> learn<00:01:05.960> something

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
it and then wanted to learn something

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.139 
it and then wanted to learn something
new<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:06.740> looked<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.190> up<00:01:07.250> either<00:01:07.490> in<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.729> book<00:01:07.910> or

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
new I looked it up either in a book or

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.790 
new I looked it up either in a book or
on<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.479> internet<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.170> added<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.530> little<00:01:09.649> bit

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
on the internet and added a little bit

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.710 
on the internet and added a little bit
to<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.009> it's<00:01:10.340> really<00:01:10.700> not<00:01:10.850> unlike<00:01:11.060> kind<00:01:11.660> of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
to it it's really not unlike kind of

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.359 
to it it's really not unlike kind of
playing<00:01:11.930> an<00:01:12.050> instrument<00:01:12.410> or<00:01:12.590> something<00:01:12.890> or

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
playing an instrument or something or

out being very intimidating but kind of

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.820 
out being very intimidating but kind of
get<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.789> hang<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.149> over<00:01:20.330> time<00:01:20.740> clothing<00:01:21.740> is

something<00:01:22.160> that<00:01:22.459> can<00:01:22.610> be<00:01:22.729> learned<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:24.140> know

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
something that can be learned and I know

something that can be learned and I know
it<00:01:24.830> can<00:01:24.979> be<00:01:25.009> intimidating<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.970> lot<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.420> things

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
it can be intimidating a lot of things

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.249 
it can be intimidating a lot of things
are<00:01:26.869> intimidating<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:28.970> know<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:30.020> isn't

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
are intimidating but you know what isn't

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.930 
are intimidating but you know what isn't
a<00:01:30.649> lot<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.099> coding<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.369> people<00:01:31.670> do<00:01:31.819> is

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
a lot of the coding that people do is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.139 
a lot of the coding that people do is
actually<00:01:31.970> fairly<00:01:32.479> simple<00:01:32.979> it's<00:01:33.979> it's<00:01:34.849> more

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
actually fairly simple it's it's more

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.520 
actually fairly simple it's it's more

about the process of breaking down
problems<00:01:36.800> then<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.940> know<00:01:38.270> sort<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.569> coming<00:01:38.929> up

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
problems then you know sort of coming up

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.230 
problems then you know sort of coming up
with<00:01:39.080> complicated<00:01:39.979> algorithms<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:40.789> people
