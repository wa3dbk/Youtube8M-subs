let's clarify exactly what we're talking

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.770 
let's clarify exactly what we're talking
about<00:00:34.980> right<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.250> super<00:00:35.700> sets<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.180> sets

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
about right now super sets are sets

where you were trading antagonistic

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
where you were trading antagonistic
muscles<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.629> muscles<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.649> opposites<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
muscles so muscles that are opposites of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.869 
muscles so muscles that are opposites of
each<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:42.180> let's<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> arm<00:00:43.290> 4<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.670> an

response<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.860> there's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.189> lot<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> time

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
response because there's a lot of time

under<00:02:03.210> tension<00:02:03.240> plus<00:02:03.810> you're<00:02:03.960> using<00:02:04.399> bigger

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
under tension plus you're using bigger

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.869 
under tension plus you're using bigger
sets<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> muscles<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.350> same<00:02:07.590> set<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.759> know

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
sets of muscles in the same set you know

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.779 
sets of muscles in the same set you know
I'm<00:02:08.940> using<00:02:09.119> these<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> big

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
I'm using these a big

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.339 
I'm using these a big
muscles<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:10.360> those<00:02:10.509> was<00:02:10.689> back<00:02:10.929> there<00:02:11.170> so

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
muscles and so those was back there so

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.199 
muscles and so those was back there so
I'm<00:02:11.439> using<00:02:11.650> them<00:02:11.860> at<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> same<00:02:12.129> time<00:02:12.189> the<00:02:13.060> more

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
I'm using them at the same time the more

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.020 
I'm using them at the same time the more
big<00:02:13.450> muscles<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.079> use<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.439> more<00:02:14.560> complex<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
big muscles you use the more complex the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.459 
big muscles you use the more complex the
movements<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.900> more<00:02:17.079> of<00:02:17.140> an<00:02:17.200> antibiotic

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
movements the more of an antibiotic

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.819 
movements the more of an antibiotic
response<00:02:17.980> are<00:02:18.099> going<00:02:18.219> to<00:02:18.280> get<00:02:18.459> right<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.709> I'll

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
response are going to get right so I'll

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.270 
response are going to get right so I'll
do<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:23.109> with<00:02:23.230> regard<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> drop<00:02:23.980> sets

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
do that but but with regard to drop sets

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.220 
do that but but with regard to drop sets
you're<00:02:25.000> you're<00:02:25.480> going<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.659> get<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> bigger

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
you're you're going to get a bigger

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.160 
you're you're going to get a bigger
particular<00:02:27.159> muscle<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.819> muscle<00:02:28.209> itself<00:02:28.689> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
particular muscle that muscle itself the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.020 
particular muscle that muscle itself the
shape<00:02:29.409> of<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.650> muscle<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.159> if<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.609> did<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> drop

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
shape of that muscle so if I did a drop

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.210 
shape of that muscle so if I did a drop
set<00:02:31.239> where<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.450> did<00:02:31.840> weighted<00:02:32.530> push-ups<00:02:32.950> with

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
set where I did weighted push-ups with

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.729 
set where I did weighted push-ups with
the<00:02:33.310> band's<00:02:33.670> did<00:02:34.299> eight<00:02:34.510> reps<00:02:34.810> took<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:35.500> band

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
the band's did eight reps took the band

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.740 
the band's did eight reps took the band
off<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.129> then<00:02:36.280> banged<00:02:36.519> out<00:02:36.700> more<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:37.510> it's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
off and then banged out more now it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.349 
off and then banged out more now it's
more<00:02:37.930> direct<00:02:38.139> it's<00:02:39.040> not<00:02:39.219> the<00:02:39.400> big<00:02:39.909> response

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
more direct it's not the big response

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.539 
more direct it's not the big response
it's<00:02:40.659> not<00:02:40.810> training<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.950> entire<00:02:42.220> body

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
it's not training the the entire body

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.129 
it's not training the the entire body
and<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.790> same<00:02:42.939> way<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.090> drop<00:02:43.329> set<00:02:43.510> does<00:02:43.689> or

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
and the same way the drop set does or

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.960 
and the same way the drop set does or
that<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:46.049> superset<00:02:47.049> does<00:02:47.549> they're<00:02:48.549> both<00:02:48.760> good

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
that a superset does they're both good

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.729 
that a superset does they're both good
if<00:02:49.569> you're<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> bodybuilder<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.439> should<00:02:50.650> be

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
if you're a bodybuilder you should be

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.520 
if you're a bodybuilder you should be
using<00:02:50.919> both<00:02:51.340> what<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> recommend<00:02:52.870> because<00:02:53.439> it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
using both what I recommend because it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.280 
using both what I recommend because it
really<00:02:53.769> there<00:02:53.919> are<00:02:54.099> no<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:55.480> way<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.780> do

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
really there are no one way to do

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.080 
really there are no one way to do
anything<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.859> lot<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.430> these<00:02:57.489> guys<00:02:57.639> want<00:02:57.879> to<00:02:57.970> put

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
anything a lot of these guys want to put

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.640 
anything a lot of these guys want to put
their<00:02:58.209> stamp<00:02:58.419> on<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.689> particular<00:02:58.989> way<00:02:59.620> of

their stamp on a particular way of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.409 
their stamp on a particular way of

of his websites check his stuff out look
for<00:03:39.669> different<00:03:40.000> techniques<00:03:40.419> that<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.690> can

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
for different techniques that you can

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.979 
for different techniques that you can
rotate<00:03:41.949> through<00:03:42.790> your<00:03:42.940> program<00:03:43.419> drop<00:03:43.720> sets

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
rotate through your program drop sets

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.430 
rotate through your program drop sets
are<00:03:44.139> good<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.400> are<00:03:45.780> super<00:03:46.780> sets<00:03:46.989> use<00:03:47.260> them

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
are good and so are super sets use them
