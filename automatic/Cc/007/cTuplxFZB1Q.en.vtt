00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
for the monster count that's

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.260 
for the monster count that's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
notable is that there is no tragg and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.300 
notable is that there is no tragg and

that is because he actually did some

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.790 
that is because he actually did some
little<00:02:17.910> bit<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.180> research<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:19.290> some<00:02:19.500> YouTube

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
little bit of research with some YouTube

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
videos and said that a lot of people

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
videos and said that a lot of people
that<00:02:22.200> had<00:02:22.350> profiles<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.040> were<00:02:23.190> running

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
that had profiles that were running

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.170 
that had profiles that were running
tragg

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
tragg

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.090

said<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.260> didn't<00:02:25.560> help<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:25.770> much

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
said that it really didn't help so much

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.850 
said that it really didn't help so much
and<00:02:26.460> his<00:02:27.210> deck<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.810> said<00:02:28.020> before<00:02:28.110> wants<00:02:28.710> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and his deck like I said before wants to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.300 
and his deck like I said before wants to
otk<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:30.240> doesn't<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.110> want<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> stall<00:02:31.890> so

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
otk it doesn't really want to stall so

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.880 
otk it doesn't really want to stall so
much<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.850> she<00:02:33.210> drags<00:02:33.600> main<00:02:34.200> purpose<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.800> to

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
much and she drags main purpose is to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.750 
much and she drags main purpose is to
stop<00:02:35.840> opponent<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:36.930> TK's<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.650> doesn't<00:02:38.640> really

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
stop opponent so TK's and doesn't really

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.790 
stop opponent so TK's and doesn't really
do<00:02:38.910> too<00:02:39.090> much<00:02:39.240> after<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.170> he<00:02:40.470> figured

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
do too much after that so he figured

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.350 
do too much after that so he figured
that<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.040> long<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.220> he<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.490> otk<00:02:41.880> faster<00:02:42.240> than

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that as long as he can otk faster than

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.570 
that as long as he can otk faster than
the<00:02:42.450> other<00:02:42.570> guy<00:02:42.750> he's<00:02:43.320> got<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.830> he<00:02:44.250> got<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the other guy he's got it and he got it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.170 
the other guy he's got it and he got it
so<00:02:44.790> look<00:02:44.910> at<00:02:45.030> that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
so look at that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.660 
so look at that
um<00:02:45.560> spells<00:02:46.560> are<00:02:46.770> pretty<00:02:47.040> straightforward

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
um spells are pretty straightforward

milling the + then yes is amazing how

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.670 
milling the + then yes is amazing how
that<00:03:20.490> works<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.910> um<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.650> pretty

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
straightforward none of the jins

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.260 
straightforward none of the jins
but<00:04:46.830> that's<00:04:47.129> not<00:04:47.280> really<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> big<00:04:47.729> deal<00:04:47.759> he

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
but that's not really a big deal he

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.670 
but that's not really a big deal he
didn't<00:04:48.870> even<00:04:48.930> really<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.229> what<00:04:49.409> they<00:04:49.500> did

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
didn't even really know what they did

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.770 
didn't even really know what they did
actually<00:04:50.009> he<00:04:50.610> says<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:50.879> the<00:04:50.940> video<00:04:51.030> I<00:04:51.360> don't

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
actually he says in the video I don't

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.390 
actually he says in the video I don't
know<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.080> hell<00:04:52.199> temtempo<00:04:52.530> did<00:04:52.889> but<00:04:53.129> I<00:04:53.310> don't

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
know the hell temtempo did but I don't

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.640 
know the hell temtempo did but I don't
really<00:04:53.639> care<00:04:53.759> just<00:04:54.419> ran<00:04:54.840> zenmaines<00:04:55.229> instead

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
really care just ran zenmaines instead

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.749 
really care just ran zenmaines instead
so<00:04:56.009> that's<00:04:56.430> what<00:04:56.550> he<00:04:56.610> did

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
utility safe wasn't really much of a use

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.140 
utility safe wasn't really much of a use
to<00:04:58.979> him<00:04:59.099> but<00:04:59.250> he<00:04:59.310> had<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.699> there<00:04:59.849> just<00:04:59.970> in
