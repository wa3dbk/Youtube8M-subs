now<00:00:00.900> that<00:00:01.079> I've<00:00:01.199> told<00:00:01.439> you<00:00:01.650> what<00:00:01.829> Newton's

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
now that I've told you what Newton's

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.100 
now that I've told you what Newton's
second<00:00:02.520> law<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.909> it's<00:00:03.300> time<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.659> see<00:00:03.840> it<00:00:03.929> in

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
second law is it's time to see it in

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.730 
second law is it's time to see it in
action<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.500> little<00:00:04.589> bit<00:00:04.859> with<00:00:05.040> some<00:00:05.069> problems<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
action a little bit with some problems a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.259 
action a little bit with some problems a
classic<00:00:07.740> example<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.240> I

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
classic example of this and one that I

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.330 
classic example of this and one that I
see<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> lot<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> test<00:00:10.080> problems<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.980> man

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
see a lot of test problems on is a man

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.400 
see a lot of test problems on is a man
in<00:00:11.519> an<00:00:11.610> elevator<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.420> what<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> forces<00:00:13.200> are

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
in an elevator and what the forces are

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.499 
in an elevator and what the forces are
on<00:00:13.650> him<00:00:14.130> when<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> elevator<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.269> and

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
on him when the elevator is going up and

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.029 
on him when the elevator is going up and
down<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.990> sort<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.320> thing<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.710> let<00:00:16.949> me

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
down and that sort of thing so let me

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.849 
down and that sort of thing so let me
sketch<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.680> I've<00:00:19.830> got

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
sketch this out for you so here I've got

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.740 
sketch this out for you so here I've got
my<00:00:20.039> guy<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.670> he's<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:21.090> hanging<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
my guy and he's just hanging out in the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.179 
my guy and he's just hanging out in the
elevator<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> draw<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> whole

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
elevator and we're going to draw a whole

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.920 
elevator and we're going to draw a whole
bunch<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.550> different<00:00:23.880> situations<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.750> what

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
bunch of different situations of what

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.660 
bunch of different situations of what
the<00:00:25.050> elevator<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.980> while<00:00:26.220> he's<00:00:26.400> standing

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the elevator can do while he's standing

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.550 
the elevator can do while he's standing
there<00:00:26.849> I'm<00:00:27.359> sure<00:00:27.720> maybe<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> were

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
there I'm sure maybe when you were

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
there I'm sure maybe when you were
younger<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.250> perhaps<00:00:29.699> even<00:00:29.970> now<00:00:30.300> you've<00:00:30.539> spent

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
younger or perhaps even now you've spent

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.170 
younger or perhaps even now you've spent
some<00:00:31.019> time<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.410> an<00:00:31.500> elevator<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
some time in an elevator going up and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.090 
some time in an elevator going up and
going<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.350> felt<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> weird

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
going down and it felt kind of weird

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.790 
going down and it felt kind of weird
right<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> talk<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.780> why<00:00:37.200> but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
right we're going to talk about why but

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.610 
right we're going to talk about why but
anyway<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.430> guy<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.700> 60<00:00:39.270> kilograms<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.469> help

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
anyway this guy is 60 kilograms to help

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
anyway this guy is 60 kilograms to help
us<00:00:40.770> figure<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.129> exactly<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> forces

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
us figure out exactly what the forces

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
us figure out exactly what the forces
are<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.870> him<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.230> let's<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.530> some

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
are going to be on him so let's get some

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.549 
are going to be on him so let's get some
situations<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> first<00:00:46.289> case

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
situations going so in the first case

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
situations going so in the first case
let's<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.160> say<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> elevator<00:00:48.000> remains

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
let's just say that the elevator remains

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.180 
let's just say that the elevator remains
motionless<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> find<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.039> what

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
motionless and we want to find out what

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
motionless and we want to find out what
the<00:00:50.280> force<00:00:50.550> diagram<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.629> him

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the force diagram is going to be on him

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
the force diagram is going to be on him
it's<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> same<00:00:52.590> process<00:00:52.890> we've<00:00:53.309> been<00:00:53.520> doing

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it's the same process we've been doing

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
it's the same process we've been doing
if<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> elevator<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> man<00:00:56.730> stay

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
if the elevator and the man stay

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
if the elevator and the man stay
motionless<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.960> Newton's<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:58.649> law<00:00:58.800> says

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
motionless then Newton's first law says

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
motionless then Newton's first law says
that<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> forces<00:01:00.000> must<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.840> balance<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that the forces must be in balance and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.229 
that the forces must be in balance and
there's<00:01:01.980> always<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> force<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
there's always going to be a force of

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.660 
there's always going to be a force of
gravity<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.650> ten<00:01:05.129> times<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
gravity on you it's just ten times the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
gravity on you it's just ten times the
mass<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.570> he<00:01:06.659> had<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> mass<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.380> 60<00:01:07.740> kilograms

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
mass so if he had a mass of 60 kilograms

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.420 
mass so if he had a mass of 60 kilograms
then<00:01:08.880> his<00:01:09.000> force<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> gravity<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.229> 600<00:01:11.010> Newtons

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
then his force of gravity is 600 Newtons

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460 
then his force of gravity is 600 Newtons
and<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> normal

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and there would have to be a normal

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
and there would have to be a normal
force<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.890> 600<00:01:14.369> Newtons<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.360> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
force of 600 Newtons as well in this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
force of 600 Newtons as well in this
case<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> normal<00:01:16.530> force<00:01:16.770> simply<00:01:17.189> means<00:01:17.430> how

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
case the normal force simply means how

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
case the normal force simply means how
hard<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.630> floor<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> elevator<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
hard the floor of the elevator is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.850 
hard the floor of the elevator is
pushing<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.330> guy<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.439> were<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
pushing up on the guy so if you were to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.940 
pushing up on the guy so if you were to
stand<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> bathroom<00:01:23.939> scale<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
stand on a bathroom scale and you have a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.390 
stand on a bathroom scale and you have a
weight<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> 600<00:01:27.479> Newtons<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.890> scale

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
weight of 600 Newtons then the scale

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.429 
weight of 600 Newtons then the scale
would<00:01:29.700> read<00:01:30.000> 600<00:01:30.689> Newtons<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
would read 600 Newtons so this is a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.590 
would read 600 Newtons so this is a
pretty<00:01:31.710> boring<00:01:32.340> situation<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.299> they'll<00:01:33.450> get

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
pretty boring situation but they'll get

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
pretty boring situation but they'll get
a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:33.960> interesting<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:36.180> next

third floor and the elevator all of a
sudden<00:01:41.310> starts<00:01:41.700> accelerating<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sudden starts accelerating up the

elevator<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.369> rest<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.390> sudden

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
elevator was at rest but all of a sudden

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
elevator was at rest but all of a sudden
it's<00:01:45.930> moving<00:01:46.380> faster<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.040> faster<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.490> faster

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it's moving faster and faster and faster

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's moving faster and faster and faster
and<00:01:48.030> you've<00:01:48.479> been<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> an<00:01:48.960> elevator<00:01:49.439> before<00:01:49.649> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and you've been in an elevator before so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
and you've been in an elevator before so
you<00:01:50.130> felt<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.990> feel<00:01:52.290> when

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you felt this right how do you feel when

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
you felt this right how do you feel when
the<00:01:52.560> elevator<00:01:53.070> suddenly<00:01:53.610> starts<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.210> up

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the elevator suddenly starts going up

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.260 
the elevator suddenly starts going up
well<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.439> feel<00:01:55.680> heavier<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
well you feel heavier and we're going to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.800 
well you feel heavier and we're going to
show<00:01:57.450> why<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> forces<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.509> begin

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
show why the forces do that so we begin

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.990 
show why the forces do that so we begin
with<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.079> force<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.530> gravity<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> 600<00:02:02.640> Newtons

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
with the force of gravity of 600 Newtons

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.569 
with the force of gravity of 600 Newtons
no<00:02:03.329> surprises<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> normal<00:02:05.310> force

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
no surprises here but the normal force

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.620 
no surprises here but the normal force
is<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> take<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.390> bit<00:02:06.509> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is going to take a little bit of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.100 
is going to take a little bit of
calculation<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.239> Newton's<00:02:09.539> second

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
calculation if we use Newton's second

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.150 
calculation if we use Newton's second
law<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.890> show<00:02:11.250> F<00:02:11.459> net<00:02:11.819> equals<00:02:12.209> MA

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
law here then we show F net equals MA

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.770 
law here then we show F net equals MA
in<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.370> case<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:13.790> know<00:02:14.000> mass<00:02:14.420> and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
in this case we know mass and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.990 
in this case we know mass and
acceleration<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.800> guy<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.190> 60<00:02:16.520> kilograms

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
acceleration the guy was 60 kilograms

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.570 
acceleration the guy was 60 kilograms
and<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> acceleration<00:02:17.810> was<00:02:18.500> 1.5<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.490> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
and the acceleration was 1.5 in the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280 
and the acceleration was 1.5 in the
upward<00:02:19.910> direction<00:02:20.390> which<00:02:20.420> gives<00:02:20.780> us<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.080> net

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
upward direction which gives us a net

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.820 
upward direction which gives us a net
force<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.950> 90<00:02:22.490> Newtons<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.810> case<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
force of 90 Newtons so in this case the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.230 
force of 90 Newtons so in this case the
normal<00:02:25.100> force<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:26.470> equal<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.740> 90<00:02:28.520> Newtons<00:02:29.480> I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
normal force is equal to 90 Newtons I

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.760 
normal force is equal to 90 Newtons I
hope<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.420> were<00:02:32.540> paying<00:02:32.570> attention<00:02:32.960> because

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
hope you were paying attention because

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.710 
hope you were paying attention because
what<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.430> said<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.910> wrong<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
what I just said is wrong and it's a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.110 
what I just said is wrong and it's a
mistake<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> lot<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.770> students<00:02:37.220> make<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
mistake I see a lot of students make the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.590 
mistake I see a lot of students make the
normal<00:02:38.450> force<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.580> definitely<00:02:40.580> not<00:02:40.970> 90

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
normal force here is definitely not 90

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.230 
normal force here is definitely not 90
Newtons<00:02:42.020> what<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> said<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.820> net

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
Newtons what I said is that the net

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.600 
Newtons what I said is that the net
force<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:45.020> 90<00:02:45.590> Newtons<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.070> we<00:02:46.190> can't<00:02:46.400> just

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
force is 90 Newtons so we can't just

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.300 
force is 90 Newtons so we can't just
throw<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.790> 90<00:02:47.270> there<00:02:47.510> what<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.110> means<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
throw a 90 there what it means is the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.120 
throw a 90 there what it means is the
leftovers<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.510> extra<00:02:51.230> force<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.890> left

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
leftovers the extra force that's left

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.050 
leftovers the extra force that's left
over<00:02:52.370> at<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.520> end<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.240> equal<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.720> 90<00:02:54.050> Newtons

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
over at the end is equal to 90 Newtons

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.520 
over at the end is equal to 90 Newtons
this<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.540> correct<00:02:56.900> way<00:02:56.990> that<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.320> use

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
this is the correct way that you use

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.200 
this is the correct way that you use
that<00:02:57.710> information<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.520> would<00:02:58.670> say<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:58.910> the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
that information you would say that the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.040 
that information you would say that the
normal<00:02:59.630> force<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.880> 690<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.090> other<00:03:02.630> words<00:03:02.840> if<00:03:03.020> he

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
normal force is 690 in other words if he

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.900 
normal force is 690 in other words if he

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
were standing on a bathroom scale what a

elevator all of a sudden starts going up

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.260 
elevator all of a sudden starts going up
you<00:03:14.480> feel<00:03:14.870> heavier<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:16.280> normal<00:03:16.820> force<00:03:17.090> is

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
you feel heavier and the normal force is

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.300 
you feel heavier and the normal force is
what<00:03:17.450> describes<00:03:17.900> how<00:03:18.080> heavy<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.530> feel<00:03:18.830> not

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
what describes how heavy you feel not

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.550 
what describes how heavy you feel not
the<00:03:19.490> force<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.880> gravity<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:21.230> force

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
the force of gravity so this force

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.670 
the force of gravity so this force

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.990 
acceleration on the man I'm going to
start<00:03:30.260> going<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.650> little<00:03:30.770> quicker<00:03:31.190> on<00:03:31.490> these<00:03:31.760> on

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
start going a little quicker on these on

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.660 
start going a little quicker on these on
this<00:03:32.510> one<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> elevator<00:03:33.380> simply<00:03:34.040> goes<00:03:34.250> down

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
this one the elevator simply goes down

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.630 
this one the elevator simply goes down
at<00:03:35.060> 3<00:03:35.450> meters<00:03:35.810> per<00:03:35.840> second<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.400> case

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
at 3 meters per second and in that case

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.730 
at 3 meters per second and in that case
it's<00:03:37.940> not<00:03:38.330> accelerating<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.410> going<00:03:39.560> at

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
it's not accelerating it's just going at

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.670 
it's not accelerating it's just going at
a<00:03:39.770> constant<00:03:40.130> velocity<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.989> actually<00:03:42.410> turns

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
a constant velocity it actually turns

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.650 
a constant velocity it actually turns
out<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.550> exact<00:03:44.000> same<00:03:44.239> answer<00:03:44.630> that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
out this is the exact same answer that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.410 
out this is the exact same answer that
we<00:03:44.810> got<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.350> first<00:03:45.560> one<00:03:45.920> because<00:03:46.880> if<00:03:47.209> he's

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
we got on the first one because if he's

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.630 
we got on the first one because if he's
going<00:03:47.690> at<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> constant<00:03:48.230> velocity<00:03:48.440> there's<00:03:49.280> no

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
going at a constant velocity there's no

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.130 
going at a constant velocity there's no
acceleration<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.720> if<00:03:50.780> there's<00:03:50.959> no

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
acceleration and if there's no

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.840 
acceleration and if there's no
acceleration<00:03:51.709> then<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.190> forces<00:03:52.489> are<00:03:52.760> in

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
acceleration then the forces are in

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.180 
acceleration then the forces are in
balance<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.989> felt<00:03:54.320> this<00:03:54.530> before<00:03:54.950> right

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
balance and you felt this before right

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.150 
balance and you felt this before right
you<00:03:55.790> only<00:03:55.940> feel<00:03:56.480> heavier<00:03:57.110> or<00:03:57.380> lighter<00:03:57.410> when

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
you only feel heavier or lighter when

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.850 
you only feel heavier or lighter when
the<00:03:58.250> elevator<00:03:58.790> changes<00:03:59.780> its<00:04:00.020> velocity<00:04:00.709> if

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the elevator changes its velocity if

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.610 
the elevator changes its velocity if
it's<00:04:01.400> going<00:04:01.790> at<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:01.970> constant<00:04:02.660> velocity<00:04:02.959> it

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
it's going at a constant velocity it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.710 
it's going at a constant velocity it
doesn't<00:04:04.250> matter<00:04:04.400> how<00:04:04.610> fast<00:04:04.850> it's<00:04:05.150> going<00:04:05.300> up<00:04:05.540> or

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
doesn't matter how fast it's going up or

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.320 
doesn't matter how fast it's going up or
down<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:06.290> can't<00:04:06.650> feel<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.459> feel<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:08.090> same

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
down you can't feel it you feel the same

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.810 
down you can't feel it you feel the same
as<00:04:08.570> usual<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.739> forces<00:04:10.010> are<00:04:10.250> unbalanced

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
as usual so the forces are unbalanced

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.340 
as usual so the forces are unbalanced
they're<00:04:10.970> just<00:04:11.300> like<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.810> elevator<00:04:12.140> we're

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
they're just like if the elevator we're

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.040 
they're just like if the elevator we're

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.990

feel<00:04:23.780> lighter<00:04:24.880> using<00:04:25.880> Newton's

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
feel lighter using Newton's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.670

in<00:04:26.580> LA<00:04:26.729> we<00:04:27.090> find<00:04:27.389> out<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.870> net<00:04:28.110> force<00:04:28.470> on

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
in LA we find out that the net force on

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.029 
in LA we find out that the net force on
this<00:04:28.860> man's<00:04:29.100> body<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.990> 240<00:04:30.990> Newton's<00:04:31.169> but<00:04:31.889> the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
this man's body is 240 Newton's but the

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.529 
this man's body is 240 Newton's but the
way<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.430> plays<00:04:32.729> out<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.300> one

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
way that that plays out and this one

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.950 
way that that plays out and this one
looks<00:04:33.750> like<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.259> in<00:04:34.789> this<00:04:35.789> case<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.660> net

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
looks like this in this case that net

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.680 
looks like this in this case that net
force<00:04:37.320> is<00:04:37.560> pointing<00:04:38.070> down<00:04:38.490> which<00:04:39.210> means<00:04:39.479> the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
force is pointing down which means the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.430 
force is pointing down which means the
normal<00:04:40.050> force<00:04:40.259> has<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.759> 240<00:04:41.960> weaker<00:04:42.960> than

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
normal force has to be 240 weaker than

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.560 
normal force has to be 240 weaker than
the<00:04:43.620> force<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:44.070> gravity<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:44.699> you<00:04:44.729> get<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.210> normal

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
the force of gravity so you get a normal

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.330 
the force of gravity so you get a normal
force<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:46.020> 360<00:04:46.860> Newtons

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
force of 360 Newtons

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.570 
force of 360 Newtons
the<00:04:47.580> guy<00:04:47.759> doesn't<00:04:48.000> feel<00:04:48.300> as<00:04:48.479> heavy<00:04:48.780> anymore

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
the guy doesn't feel as heavy anymore

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.100 
the guy doesn't feel as heavy anymore
for<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:50.729> last<00:04:51.000> one<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.539> man<00:04:51.690> actually

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
for this last one the man actually

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.350 
for this last one the man actually
brings<00:04:52.470> his<00:04:52.740> own<00:04:52.860> bathroom<00:04:53.370> scale<00:04:53.699> on<00:04:53.940> board

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
brings his own bathroom scale on board

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.749 
brings his own bathroom scale on board
and<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.570> bathroom<00:04:54.960> scale<00:04:55.139> reads<00:04:55.560> 800<00:04:56.280> Newtons

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
and the bathroom scale reads 800 Newtons

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.029 
and the bathroom scale reads 800 Newtons
even<00:04:57.270> though<00:04:57.330> he's<00:04:57.479> only<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.780> 600<00:04:58.560> Newton<00:04:58.830> guy

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
even though he's only a 600 Newton guy

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.219 
even though he's only a 600 Newton guy
we<00:04:59.759> want<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.060> know<00:05:00.150> what's<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.539> acceleration

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
we want to know what's the acceleration

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.430 
we want to know what's the acceleration
of<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.440> elevator<00:05:01.949> based<00:05:02.310> on<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.669> reading<00:05:03.090> in

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
of the elevator based on that reading in

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.080 
of the elevator based on that reading in
this<00:05:04.440> case<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.130> reading<00:05:05.490> on<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.669> bathroom

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
this case the reading on the bathroom

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.779 
this case the reading on the bathroom
scale<00:05:06.240> tells<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.930> his<00:05:07.169> normal<00:05:07.800> force<00:05:08.099> so<00:05:08.699> the

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
scale tells you his normal force so the

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.270 
scale tells you his normal force so the
force<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.120> gravity<00:05:09.690> on<00:05:09.870> him<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.289> 600<00:05:10.949> Newtons

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
force of gravity on him is 600 Newtons

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.570 
force of gravity on him is 600 Newtons
down<00:05:11.699> but<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.660> normal<00:05:13.199> force<00:05:13.470> up<00:05:13.650> on<00:05:14.130> him<00:05:14.400> is

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
down but the normal force up on him is

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.379 
down but the normal force up on him is
800<00:05:15.389> Newtons<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:16.080> produce<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.560> net<00:05:16.740> force<00:05:17.039> if

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
800 Newtons to produce that net force if

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.570 
800 Newtons to produce that net force if
I<00:05:18.389> run<00:05:18.630> Newton's<00:05:19.050> second<00:05:19.500> law<00:05:19.560> on<00:05:19.830> this<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.220> get
