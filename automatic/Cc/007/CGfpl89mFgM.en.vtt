00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.000
 Hello, everyone. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.180
 Today in Brazil, for you, a video store respect said insults 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.309
 if you have anything to show 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.379
 respect for a thorn endorsement 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm going to use windows xp mode and crashed laterally into the river 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.250
 we had to apologize for not being able to be present the next day 6 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.419
 what is needed said it is not necessary inside the system 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.119
 no one can make all the difference in the performance of your 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.119
 computer 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 in the mind approve the qimonda affirmed dina 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.250
 It's the reason I'm here to destroy you. 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.830
 Nothing here was at first 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.060
 but let's try - start 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 on my computer with the right mouse button 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 on the occasion manage 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.330
 and then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.500
 but in terms of efficiency retained 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 again 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.390
 here you go 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.210
 a series of options 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.750
 you can allow them to be marked or not recommend you have to play 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.180
 more room to view 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 double 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 double-click here in this area 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 lindsay displaying decision name 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.370
 capabilities can view 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.930
 the song to do step by step we will check if they were 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.040
 initiated 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 it is in the stadium support stage you click 2 times left over 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.970
 Support 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.319
 the characteristic 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.319
 is here 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.489
 All in all this takes time 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.709
 which is 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.139
 and qualify the service 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.009
 the integration of these 1 with the objective of 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.439
 your mother only exists here in the river the thermometers 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.349
 automatic updates 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.609
 so it can only as it should be I know that you will forget that you are responsible for 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.499
 drastically reduce the performance of your 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.449
 past recklessness updated 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.779
 the same tone dries that if they are updated after tactic is 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.309
 right 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.309
 audio leaves on betty page views 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.489
 How is security 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 another career - explained himself saying avoid 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.549
 configuration 0105 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.469
 if you do not have a country 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.989
 your computer 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.169
 windows xp 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.379
 if you can apply the solution 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.980
 this option passes with what counts now rectifies looking for the technician and few 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.329
 looking for or collectively 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.659
 bpn lost money highlights the promoter what I think 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.599
 I in my opinion 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.709
 during the end of the league on a home computer, the location is not 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.440
 have a server 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.799
 or something online motivates power to activate 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.109
 can activate without fear because 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.430
 It's no use, no kind of long fish sucks. 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.210
 Unexpected time 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.820
 sync out of synced action will only hurt 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.680
 your computer will take if they adopt a right attitude is not known which 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.459
 is the limit 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.979
 Why does not it seem so simple? 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.979
 then it will be effective 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.170
 regis tourism so soft to you what is that we are silly 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 allows users 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.830
 which allows remote users to modify a fiscal management contract 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.490
 office 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 basically the attack 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.499
 it was all written 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.819
 the solution is to buy none of this because it is part of your 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.960
 computer 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.020
 just you go from that space is occupied cbg transfers smart 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.599
 pandit wells 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.599
 was off the t-shirt 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.870
 if the most qualified there is a day that is not useful to you something that in the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.279
 last time the server 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.469
 Your contract is a secret. 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.469
 has not succeeded in this function 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.639
 another if the story 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.950
 the functions of botafogo-sp 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.110
 and if you qualify there is some chance in the team 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.210
 for you what others do not 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.259
 It's interesting to note that. 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.979
 understand that it is something that will give consume resources to the current system 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.040
 no need as part of the visit sequence 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:37.979
 from the club 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.650
 Are you going to come home? 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.129
 I activated 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.710
 to tie apply to the ocde 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.150
 very simple another example you 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.490
 reasoning the entity informed that ten minutes 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.689
 xp 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.159
 this function 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.360
 the teradata and even jatiÃºca 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.629
 this action 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.629
 he would take as many as would require Magali 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.250
 O 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.020
 the senses 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.089
 I'm going to release that requires game spends 15 on geneva voted utility 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:11.779
 this restoration is nothing she had the paranaense pilot 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:15.289
 the installation of the house of the political forts 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.270
 deny space with four count a thing that has to be weakened people 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.270
 look at the committee for you to see one more 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.379
 the question 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:29.669
 what a really change 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.039
 must be carried out in accordance with what can be done with the head of the 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.080
 section I loved it I'm doing it if it has to be done 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.229
 as the municipal guard already placed 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.149
 the airport was about an hour 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.589
 interesting irritation 

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:03.389
 after putting in practice and did not like the recordla 507 also also criticizes the 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.110
 tell 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.300
 the different options for you 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.300
 I hope we make a better game that offers 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:16.069
 one thing that will make a difference on the computer or the one that makes another better 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:16.710
 option 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.180
 no one questions 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.100
 things he is trying to do to help people, thank you for the 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.599
 your attention 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.909
 I think I now spend on the video lessons 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:27.599
 hug
