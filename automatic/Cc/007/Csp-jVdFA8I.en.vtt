00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.779
 get in the tomb raid arch vano where 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.859

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.490
 maintains control 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:31.900
 over the lake ling their shackles looks like this 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:36.790
 our this mount here is the entrance 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.580
 and if your faction wins this 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:45.280
 This location is then available to you 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:53.019
 this inst what it represents 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.790
 inst we have four bosses it's 4 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.420
 guards 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.699
 fire stone aldo and and storms 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 one of them is markal himself in honor of the clip 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.600
 we hit after has not much hp from 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.690
 2 to 4 million and very simple 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.660
 twitches in the current tower therefore 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.870
 no difficulties should be 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.930
 Chance to drop from each of the bosses 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.140
 about one percent if you believe in the move 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.020
 means that in one go you can 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.560
 4 percent likely to confuse this 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.340
 mount 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.950
 you are pretty pretty different 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:41.580
 he is referring to the Horde and Alliance have alliance he 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.580
 there are blue reins of horde with red 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.579
 there is only no represents 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.689
 the dangers themselves are bosses in principle such 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.689
 quite beautiful 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.609
 safe for the first kill for 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.659
 each of these bosses in you get 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:06.409
 In general, the raid is very fast. 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.509
 so a lot of time it will not take you 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.989
 I was able to go about five minutes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.370
 six 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:18.000
 no longer than the usual old dungeons 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.010
 Well, I suggest you watch how it all 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.079

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.720
 of words 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.880
