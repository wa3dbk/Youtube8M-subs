00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
but to now know that bullshit let's jump

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.390 
but to now know that bullshit let's jump
right<00:01:07.380> into<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.770> theory<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.159> actually

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
right into this theory it's actually

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.679 
right into this theory it's actually
pretty<00:01:08.520> funny<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.630> into

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
pretty funny so I want to get right into

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.539 
pretty funny so I want to get right into
it<00:01:09.990> let's<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.280> now<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it let's get it going on it now the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.690 
it let's get it going on it now the
actual<00:01:12.030> theory<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:13.260> follows<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.430> doug

what<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:33.300> know<00:04:33.360> where<00:04:33.480> she<00:04:33.570> kept<00:04:33.750> her<00:04:33.810> stash

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
what you know where she kept her stash

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.320 
what you know where she kept her stash
of<00:04:34.410> elite<00:04:34.740> illicit<00:04:35.190> drugs<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:36.060> he<00:04:36.210> was

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
of elite illicit drugs that he was

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.320 
of elite illicit drugs that he was
needing<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.880> really<00:04:39.090> makes<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.300> lot

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
needing and it was it really makes a lot

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.120 
needing and it was it really makes a lot
more<00:04:39.450> sense<00:04:39.600> looking<00:04:40.230> back<00:04:40.410> at<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.680> now<00:04:40.710> that

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
more sense looking back at it now that

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.770 
more sense looking back at it now that
you<00:04:41.580> go<00:04:41.700> back<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.000> watch<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.150> episode<00:04:42.390> I've

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
you go back and watch that episode I've

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.620 
you go back and watch that episode I've
watched<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.200> couple<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.530> these<00:04:43.700> on<00:04:44.700> YouTube<00:04:45.240> and

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
watched a couple of these on YouTube and

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.840 
watched a couple of these on YouTube and
other<00:04:46.020> places<00:04:46.290> actually<00:04:47.190> on<00:04:47.430> Netflix<00:04:47.760> I

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
other places actually on Netflix I

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.050 
other places actually on Netflix I
believe<00:04:48.150> but<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:49.560> goes<00:04:49.710> me<00:04:49.950> legs<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.610> lot<00:04:50.760> more

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
believe but it goes me legs a lot more

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.340 
believe but it goes me legs a lot more
sense<00:04:51.360> when<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.600> think<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:51.990> as<00:04:52.080> he's

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
sense when you think of it as he's

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.870 
sense when you think of it as he's
stealing<00:04:52.740> drugs<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.280> others<00:04:53.520> just<00:04:53.760> he's

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
stealing drugs and others just he's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.300 
stealing drugs and others just he's
stealing<00:04:54.180> some<00:04:54.330> some<00:04:54.690> secret<00:04:55.170> item<00:04:56.070> out<00:04:56.190> of

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
stealing some some secret item out of

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.040 
stealing some some secret item out of
her<00:04:56.400> room<00:04:56.580> dealing<00:04:57.090> drugs<00:04:57.210> would<00:04:57.420> really<00:04:57.750> piss

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
her room dealing drugs would really piss

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.410 
her room dealing drugs would really piss
off<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.230> drug<00:04:58.560> head<00:04:58.770> like<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.460> it<00:05:00.210> makes<00:05:00.360> a

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
off a drug head like that and it makes a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.150 
off a drug head like that and it makes a
lot<00:05:00.510> of<00:05:00.570> sense<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.620> holds<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.010> lot<00:05:02.040> of

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
lot of sense so that holds a lot of

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.920 
lot of sense so that holds a lot of
water<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.730> this<00:05:02.850> theory<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.420> it<00:05:03.690> makes<00:05:03.840> a

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
water to this theory and it makes a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.150 
water to this theory and it makes a
perfect<00:05:04.140> sense<00:05:04.350> why<00:05:04.650> he<00:05:04.680> would<00:05:04.920> take<00:05:04.950> the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
perfect sense why he would take the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.830 
perfect sense why he would take the
drugs<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.550> just<00:05:05.850> ease<00:05:06.000> his<00:05:06.240> pain<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.660> being

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
drugs to just ease his pain of being

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.300 
drugs to just ease his pain of being
molested<00:05:07.170> by<00:05:07.440> his<00:05:07.560> next-door<00:05:07.920> neighbor<00:05:08.220> mr.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
molested by his next-door neighbor mr.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.580 
molested by his next-door neighbor mr.
dink<00:05:08.820> who's<00:05:09.330> also<00:05:09.570> his<00:05:09.840> Scoutmaster<00:05:10.140> so<00:05:10.530> he

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
dink who's also his Scoutmaster so he

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.870 
dink who's also his Scoutmaster so he
can't<00:05:10.770> really<00:05:10.860> seem<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.160> get<00:05:11.250> away<00:05:11.370> from<00:05:11.550> him

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
can't really seem to get away from him

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.540 
can't really seem to get away from him
and<00:05:12.260> really<00:05:13.260> no<00:05:13.410> other<00:05:13.650> outlet<00:05:13.860> but<00:05:14.250> drugs

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
and really no other outlet but drugs

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.640 
and really no other outlet but drugs
apparently<00:05:15.120> still<00:05:15.450> big<00:05:15.930> all<00:05:16.080> kind<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.380> makes<00:05:16.560> a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
apparently still big all kind of makes a

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.900 
apparently still big all kind of makes a
little<00:05:16.830> bit<00:05:16.920> of<00:05:17.070> sense<00:05:17.310> but<00:05:17.580> there's<00:05:17.730> a<00:05:17.760> few

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
little bit of sense but there's a few

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.980 
little bit of sense but there's a few
more<00:05:17.970> things<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.270> wanted<00:05:18.420> to<00:05:18.510> talk<00:05:18.630> about<00:05:18.660> just

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
more things I wanted to talk about just

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.510 
more things I wanted to talk about just
on<00:05:19.050> this<00:05:19.170> theory<00:05:19.320> real<00:05:19.530> quick<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.950> like<00:05:20.280> you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
on this theory real quick just like you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.970 
on this theory real quick just like you
touch<00:05:20.880> all<00:05:21.090> bases<00:05:21.660> on<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:21.930> theory<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.380> let's

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
touch all bases on this theory so let's

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.950 
touch all bases on this theory so let's
go<00:05:23.130> ahead<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.400> look<00:05:23.460> at<00:05:23.550> them<00:05:23.730> two<00:05:24.030> lastly<00:05:24.930> I

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
go ahead and look at them two lastly I

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.690 
go ahead and look at them two lastly I
just<00:05:25.080> want<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.380> give<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.500> few<00:05:25.560> examples<00:05:26.190> of<00:05:26.370> some

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
just want to give a few examples of some

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.550 
just want to give a few examples of some
of<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.120> hallucinations<00:05:27.840> that<00:05:28.050> Doug<00:05:28.290> has

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
of the hallucinations that Doug has

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.170 
of the hallucinations that Doug has
while<00:05:29.010> he's<00:05:29.130> on<00:05:29.280> these<00:05:29.430> illicit<00:05:29.820> drugs

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
while he's on these illicit drugs

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.600 
while he's on these illicit drugs
there's<00:05:30.900> one<00:05:31.110> episode<00:05:31.230> where<00:05:31.680> Doug<00:05:32.220> gets<00:05:32.430> his

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
there's one episode where Doug gets his

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
like the beats and Beatles I was pretty

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.910 
like the beats and Beatles I was pretty

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
but his first solution ation is when he

but his first solution ation is when he

classroom with Miss Wingo and she says
Doug<00:05:47.580> what<00:05:47.760> are<00:05:47.790> you<00:05:47.850> doing<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.420> he's

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
Doug what are you doing and he's

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.360 
Doug what are you doing and he's
absolutely<00:05:48.840> no<00:05:49.320> idea<00:05:49.530> what<00:05:49.860> has<00:05:49.950> happened<00:05:50.280> and

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
absolutely no idea what has happened and

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.490 
absolutely no idea what has happened and
Rogers<00:05:50.670> like<00:05:50.790> what<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.600> fuck<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:51.990> looking<00:05:52.350> at

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
Rogers like what the fuck you looking at

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.410 
Rogers like what the fuck you looking at
Doug<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.220> then<00:05:53.340> he<00:05:53.640> becomes<00:05:53.910> subtly

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
Doug and then he becomes subtly

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.240 
Doug and then he becomes subtly
pixelated<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.230> like<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:55.590> starts<00:05:55.860> going<00:05:56.010> it's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
pixelated and like it starts going it's

just how many of these shows are based
around<00:07:09.670> hilarious<00:07:10.670> fucking<00:07:11.060> things<00:07:11.270> like

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
around hilarious fucking things like

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.900 
around hilarious fucking things like
that<00:07:11.720> and<00:07:12.160> can<00:07:13.160> never<00:07:13.340> get<00:07:13.520> enough<00:07:13.610> of<00:07:13.790> these
