teams like this come up obviously I've

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.660

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
been in sat in there some other famous
faces<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.930> guess<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.289> call<00:00:22.410> them<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
faces I guess you can call them but the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.470 
faces I guess you can call them but the
chemistry<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.310> quite<00:00:23.490> low<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.269> I've

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
chemistry is quite low but now I've

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480 
chemistry is quite low but now I've
quickly<00:00:25.380> learned<00:00:25.590> especially<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:26.160> silver

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
quickly learned especially with silver

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.269 
quickly learned especially with silver
teams<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.880> doesn't<00:00:27.240> mean<00:00:27.420> much<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
teams that doesn't mean much and I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.679 
teams that doesn't mean much and I
should<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.939> taken<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.330> lead<00:00:30.449> there

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
should have really taken the lead there

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
should have really taken the lead there
you<00:00:30.990> know<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.529> defining<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you know I think the defining kind of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
you know I think the defining kind of
mastered<00:00:32.369> him<00:00:32.489> off<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> ball<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.149> bit<00:00:33.300> but

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
mastered him off the ball in a bit but

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
mastered him off the ball in a bit but
this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> pretty<00:00:34.860> much<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.219> episode<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.850> a

left mirror would ever become a gold is

are goals in this team but unfortunately

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
are goals in this team but unfortunately
and<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.290> happening<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.460> than<00:01:59.610> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and it's happening a lot more than I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
and it's happening a lot more than I
really<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:01.049> conceding<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.920> lot<00:02:02.219> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
really want it to I'm conceding a lot of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.539 
really want it to I'm conceding a lot of
goals<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.969> don't<00:02:03.750> know<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.170> how<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.130> sort

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
goals I don't know really how to sort

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.069 
goals I don't know really how to sort
their<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> can't<00:02:06.479> change<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> team

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
their you know I can't change the team

their you know I can't change the team
unless<00:02:07.259> they<00:02:07.500> perform<00:02:07.829> well<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:09.090> just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
unless they perform well but I just

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.660 
unless they perform well but I just
think<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:10.140> set<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> X<00:02:10.830> don't<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.220> enough<00:02:11.430> pace

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
think my set of X don't have enough pace

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
think my set of X don't have enough pace
you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.540> if

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
if I'm going against teams that have 85

if I'm going against teams that have 85

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

much<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:19.530> absolutely<00:02:19.680> stupid<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.459> is

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
much that was absolutely stupid this is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.460 
much that was absolutely stupid this is
in<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> 90th<00:02:21.180> minute<00:02:21.330> if<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.780> had<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.050> kick

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
in the 90th minute if I had just kick

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.320 
in the 90th minute if I had just kick
that<00:02:22.620> ball<00:02:22.830> away<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.730> would<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:23.910> won<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
that ball away we would have won the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.150 
that ball away we would have won the
game<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.720> unfortunately<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.500> gave<00:02:25.740> him<00:02:25.950> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
game and unfortunately it gave him that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 
game and unfortunately it gave him that
the<00:02:26.910> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.240> push<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.750> he<00:02:27.870> needed<00:02:28.080> to

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the kind of push on that he needed to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.770 
the kind of push on that he needed to
absolutely<00:02:28.709> destroy<00:02:28.920> me<00:02:29.370> an<00:02:29.430> extra<00:02:29.640> time<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.090> I

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
absolutely destroy me an extra time I I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.660 
absolutely destroy me an extra time I I
look<00:02:31.319> back<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.890> think<00:02:31.920> how<00:02:32.160> stupid

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
look back at that and think how stupid

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.100 
look back at that and think how stupid
was<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.910> try<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.300> play<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.750> ball<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110

defence in the 90th minute when I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360 
defence in the 90th minute when I
referees<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.870> very<00:02:37.050> lenient<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.650> times<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
referees are very lenient on times and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.449 
referees are very lenient on times and
we<00:02:38.489> do<00:02:38.640> go<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.850> lose<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:40.459> absolutely

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459

all for the left-back gets downgraded

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.540 
all for the left-back gets downgraded
which<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.380> annoying<00:02:43.620> because<00:02:43.890> he<00:02:44.160> was<00:02:44.310> one

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
which is annoying because he was one

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.430 
which is annoying because he was one
away<00:02:44.730> from<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> silver<00:02:45.660> which<00:02:46.290> would

away from going to a silver which would

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.259 
away from going to a silver which would
have<00:02:46.500> been<00:02:46.560> fantastic<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.670> know<00:02:48.060> what

first<00:03:15.000> episode<00:03:15.630> where<00:03:15.780> I've<00:03:15.840> lost<00:03:15.989> three

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
first episode where I've lost three

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930 
first episode where I've lost three
games<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.560> row<00:03:16.610> hopefully<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.760> doesn't

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
games in a row hopefully that doesn't

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.729 
games in a row hopefully that doesn't
continue<00:03:18.329> because<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.900> team<00:03:19.110> will<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.620> going

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
continue because the team will be going

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.940 
continue because the team will be going
the<00:03:20.220> wrong<00:03:20.400> way<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:20.970> does<00:03:21.120> continue<00:03:21.600> so

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the wrong way if that does continue so

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.630 
the wrong way if that does continue so
