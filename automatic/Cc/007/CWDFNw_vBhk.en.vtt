I'm<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> add<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.869> cups<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.470> soy<00:01:28.680> milk

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I'm going to add two cups of soy milk

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
I'm going to add two cups of soy milk
make<00:01:29.579> sure<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.909> an<00:01:30.030> unsweetened<00:01:30.600> soy<00:01:30.930> milk

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
make sure it's an unsweetened soy milk

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.140 
make sure it's an unsweetened soy milk
you<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> vanilla<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.000> want

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
you don't want it vanilla you don't want

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
you don't want it vanilla you don't want
it<00:01:33.270> sweet<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.110> could<00:01:34.380> maybe<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.829> almond<00:01:35.220> milk

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it sweet you could maybe use almond milk

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
it sweet you could maybe use almond milk
but<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> prefer<00:01:36.180> soy<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
but I prefer soy because I think the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
but I prefer soy because I think the
flavor<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.770> better<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.400> particular

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
flavor is better for this particular

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
flavor is better for this particular
recipe<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:40.170> getting<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.619> more

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
recipe and you're getting a lot more

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.130 
recipe and you're getting a lot more
protein<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> soy<00:01:41.700> milk<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
protein with the soy milk so we have to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
protein with the soy milk so we have to
blend<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.829> long<00:01:47.009> time<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.610> gonna

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
blend this for a long time it's gonna

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
blend this for a long time it's gonna
make<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.119> noise<00:01:48.180> maybe<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.899> three

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
make some noise maybe about three

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.770 
make some noise maybe about three
minutes<00:01:49.470> because<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
minutes because we want it to be

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.560 
minutes because we want it to be
perfectly<00:01:51.780> creamy<00:01:52.670> okay<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
perfectly creamy okay now that the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
perfectly creamy okay now that the
carrots<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> celery<00:01:55.860> are<00:01:56.369> almost<00:01:56.759> cooked

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
carrots and celery are almost cooked

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
carrots and celery are almost cooked
we're<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> add<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.740> shiitake

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
we're going to add the shiitake

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.340 
we're going to add the shiitake
mushrooms<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.090> cook<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.570> faster<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
mushrooms they cook a lot faster so

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
mushrooms they cook a lot faster so
we'll<00:02:01.500> put<00:02:01.680> them<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.979> closer<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> end<00:02:04.850> it's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
we'll put them in closer to the end it's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
we'll put them in closer to the end it's
at<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> nice<00:02:06.210> simmer

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
at a nice simmer

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.740 
at a nice simmer
