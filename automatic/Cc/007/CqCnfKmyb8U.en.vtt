confirmed<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.990> know<00:00:31.080> take<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
confirmed but you know take it with a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
confirmed but you know take it with a
grain<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.679> salt<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.520> will<00:00:32.730> probably<00:00:33.000> happen

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
grain of salt this will probably happen

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
grain of salt this will probably happen
let's<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.930> honest<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.820> know<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
let's be honest I know that you know the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.330 
let's be honest I know that you know the
regular<00:00:36.360> mark<00:00:36.540> 2<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> huge<00:00:37.110> hit<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:38.129> think

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
regular mark 2 is a huge hit and I think

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.950 
regular mark 2 is a huge hit and I think
Treyarch<00:00:38.670> realizes<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> too<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.809> they're

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
Treyarch realizes that too so they're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
Treyarch realizes that too so they're
gonna<00:00:40.050> bring<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> regular<00:00:40.950> mark<00:00:41.160> 3<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
gonna bring out the regular mark 3 and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
gonna bring out the regular mark 3 and
it's<00:00:42.000> definitely<00:00:42.300> gonna<00:00:42.540> entice<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.230> people

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's definitely gonna entice more people

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.889 
it's definitely gonna entice more people

seems that they're just throwing out
these<00:01:27.470> different<00:01:28.470> styles<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.549> ray<00:01:29.939> guns<00:01:30.210> and

there is hopefully they can come up with
something<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:36.350> like<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.439> said<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
something and like I said what kind of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
something and like I said what kind of
reagan<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> rapid<00:01:39.659> fire

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
reagan is this is gonna be a rapid fire

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
reagan is this is gonna be a rapid fire
like<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> machine<00:01:40.619> gun<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
like a machine gun I know that the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.440 
like a machine gun I know that the
original<00:01:42.090> ray<00:01:42.990> gun<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.450> automatic

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
original ray gun was actually automatic

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.410 
original ray gun was actually automatic
so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.079> mean<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.070> wasn't<00:01:47.430> necessarily<00:01:48.030> like

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so I mean it wasn't necessarily like

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
so I mean it wasn't necessarily like
automatic<00:01:49.320> automatic<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.040> guess<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.310> could

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
automatic automatic I guess you could

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
automatic automatic I guess you could
say<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.119> super<00:01:51.810> rapid<00:01:52.170> fire<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
say it was like super rapid fire like a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.260 
say it was like super rapid fire like a
machine<00:01:53.159> gun<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.369> something<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.060> but

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
machine gun or something like that but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630 
machine gun or something like that but
you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.350> automatic<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.250> I'm

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you know it was so automatic so I'm

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
you know it was so automatic so I'm
imagining<00:01:56.969> something<00:01:57.570> like

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
imagining something like

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.940 
imagining something like
something<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.790> big<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.470> I'm

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
something as big as I don't know and I'm

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
something as big as I don't know and I'm
sixteen<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.820> something<00:02:03.119> that's<00:02:03.240> held<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.960> both

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
sixteen or something that's held in both

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.550 
sixteen or something that's held in both
hands<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.000> I'm<00:02:06.000> definitely<00:02:06.210> excited<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.110> see

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
hands and I'm definitely excited to see

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
hands and I'm definitely excited to see
this<00:02:07.800> new<00:02:08.100> Raygun<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.580> action<00:02:09.030> hopefully<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
this new Raygun in action hopefully it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
this new Raygun in action hopefully it's
better<00:02:10.380> than<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> ray<00:02:10.830> gun<00:02:11.009> mark<00:02:11.190> -<00:02:11.370> obviously

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
better than the ray gun mark - obviously

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.059 
better than the ray gun mark - obviously
it<00:02:12.060> should<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.480> because<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.470> mark<00:02:13.709> 3

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it should be because it's the mark 3

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.670 
it should be because it's the mark 3
version<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:15.750> don't<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.410> really

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
version and I don't know I just really

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.140 
version and I don't know I just really
want<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.040> something<00:02:17.459> bigger<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.090> better

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
want to see something bigger and better

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.890 
want to see something bigger and better
and<00:02:18.630> shoot<00:02:19.319> faster<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:21.030> don't<00:02:21.630> know<00:02:21.870> I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and shoot faster and I don't know I

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.479 
and shoot faster and I don't know I
can't<00:02:22.230> wait<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> pack<00:02:22.830> bunch<00:02:23.130> version

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
can't wait to see the pack bunch version

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.940 
can't wait to see the pack bunch version
of<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.020> leaked<00:02:25.319> list<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.800> things

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
of it but on this leaked list of things

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
of it but on this leaked list of things
that<00:02:26.130> actually<00:02:26.250> did<00:02:26.670> say<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.270> zombies<00:02:28.020> in

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that actually did say that zombies in

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.530 
that actually did say that zombies in
black<00:02:28.380> ops<00:02:28.620> 3<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:29.130> gonna<00:02:29.489> be<00:02:29.610> very<00:02:29.819> similar<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
black ops 3 is gonna be very similar to

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
black ops 3 is gonna be very similar to
world<00:02:30.870> at<00:02:31.019> war<00:02:31.260> zombies<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.890> gonna<00:02:31.980> have

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
world at war zombies it's gonna have

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
world at war zombies it's gonna have
that<00:02:32.250> feel<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.910> everything<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.570> does<00:02:34.110> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that feel and everything so does that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.540 
that feel and everything so does that
mean<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.590> gonna<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.860> getting<00:02:34.980> more<00:02:35.280> World

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
mean we're gonna be getting more World

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.890 
mean we're gonna be getting more World
War<00:02:35.730> 2<00:02:35.970> esque<00:02:36.239> Maps

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
War 2 esque Maps

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.690 
War 2 esque Maps
are<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.350> gonna<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.530> getting<00:02:37.739> more<00:02:38.070> World<00:02:38.310> War<00:02:38.489> 2

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
are we gonna be getting more World War 2

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
are we gonna be getting more World War 2
weapons<00:02:39.150> such<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.840> mp40

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
weapons such as the mp40

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.250 
weapons such as the mp40
or<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.190> STG<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> know<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.540> game<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.989> very

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
or the STG I know that this game is very

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.060 
or the STG I know that this game is very
heavily<00:02:43.700> influenced<00:02:44.700> by<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> future<00:02:45.600> so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
heavily influenced by the future so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.350 
heavily influenced by the future so
obviously<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.820> furthest

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
obviously I think this is the furthest

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360 
obviously I think this is the furthest
they've<00:02:48.600> ever<00:02:48.750> gone<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> Call<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> Duty<00:02:49.950> in

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
they've ever gone with a Call of Duty in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940 
they've ever gone with a Call of Duty in
terms<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.820> future<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:52.350> these<00:02:52.560> guns

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
terms of the future so all these guns

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.699 
terms of the future so all these guns
are<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:53.640> loosely<00:02:54.300> based<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:54.900> things<00:02:55.530> we

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
are really loosely based on things we

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.559 
are really loosely based on things we
already<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.489> they're<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:56.910> really<00:02:57.150> real

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
already have so they're not really real

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
already have so they're not really real
I<00:02:57.600> guess<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.080> could<00:02:58.230> say<00:02:58.410> not<00:02:58.650> real<00:02:58.830> guns<00:02:59.130> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
I guess you could say not real guns and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190 
I guess you could say not real guns and
I<00:03:00.150> don't<00:03:00.330> know<00:03:00.420> how<00:03:00.540> that's<00:03:00.660> gonna<00:03:00.810> play<00:03:00.930> out

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
I don't know how that's gonna play out

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.410 
I don't know how that's gonna play out
in<00:03:01.319> zombies<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:02.880> don't<00:03:03.060> want<00:03:03.239> them

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
in zombies and I really don't want them

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.569 
in zombies and I really don't want them
to<00:03:03.900> bring<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.260> all<00:03:04.380> these<00:03:04.530> futuristic<00:03:05.160> weapons

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
to bring in all these futuristic weapons

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.520 
to bring in all these futuristic weapons
because<00:03:06.299> again<00:03:06.630> they<00:03:06.780> did<00:03:06.959> say<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.350> would

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
because again they did say that it would

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.770 
because again they did say that it would
feel<00:03:07.799> like<00:03:07.860> world<00:03:08.700> at<00:03:08.880> war<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:09.720> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
feel like world at war so it kind of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.449 
feel like world at war so it kind of
wouldn't<00:03:10.019> make<00:03:10.110> sense<00:03:10.380> if<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:11.160> know<00:03:11.190> all

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
wouldn't make sense if you know all

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.310 
wouldn't make sense if you know all
these<00:03:11.640> futuristic<00:03:12.420> weapons<00:03:12.780> were<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.140> this

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
these futuristic weapons were in this

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.580 
these futuristic weapons were in this
mode<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.610> there<00:03:14.970> actually<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:16.019> gun<00:03:16.560> that
