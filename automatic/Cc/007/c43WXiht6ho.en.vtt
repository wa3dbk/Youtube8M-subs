 the nights here also live and he is said to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.290
 everyone reads controversy 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900
 what i'm not sure about 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.210
 because he 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.840
 lazy 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.280
 bugatti 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.990

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.940
 in crime 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.490
 here calling yourself at home plus 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.329
 although it contains 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 poland for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.860
 the other two mags 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.180
 here is the link to the jump 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.250
 or gave from 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.460
 downloaded 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.900
 closing down 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.270
 and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.430
 there are also such 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.600
 useful things like for example im 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.570
 and t 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.230
 optimal production 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.370
 but neither now nor updated work with 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.970
 new version of mikroft so i 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.200
 their 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.480
 I will not 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.000
 and will steer to tell 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 so then later 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.910
 and the errors themselves fly away 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.660
 but Russia is a pole of public opinion 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.740
 I liked 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 the shot didn't work 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.530

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.250
 paws do not need to copy 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.529
 it is better to read it 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.529

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.539
 sell up to keep you know what everyone 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
 At home on the case, this verification card could 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.969
 which is not very convenient but does not give 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.099
 to help 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.749
 I myself chat is probably for I do not use but 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.989

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.069
 benefit 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.729
 as you can see 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.129
 here it is this time 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.109
 very pretty 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.149
 also to this city 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.149
 here it is also noticeable 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.969
 recess becomes canoes less 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.049

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.399
 I like it standard 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.829
 settings 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.829
