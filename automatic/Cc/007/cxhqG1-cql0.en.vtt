00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
we're going to do a test burn to make

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.970 
we're going to do a test burn to make
sure<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.820> logo<00:00:15.210> comes<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.260> nicely<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
sure that logo comes out nicely on this

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.560 
sure that logo comes out nicely on this
on<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.430> piece<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> wood<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
on this piece of wood this is just the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.400 
on this piece of wood this is just the
test<00:00:18.810> strip<00:00:19.020> from<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:20.570> same<00:00:21.570> materials<00:00:22.109> using

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
test strip from the same materials using

00:00:22.410 --> 00:01:16.780 
test strip from the same materials using
the<00:00:22.680> back<00:00:23.100> strip<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> guitar

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.970 

well<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:17.450> can<00:01:17.600> see<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.960> came<00:01:18.380> out<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:18.830> it's

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
well you can see the came out but it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.010 
well you can see the came out but it's
not<00:01:19.280> very<00:01:19.580> dark<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.330> I'm<00:01:20.510> gonna<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.810> go

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
not very dark so I'm gonna have to go

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.530 
not very dark so I'm gonna have to go
and<00:01:21.290> change<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.400> power<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.790> speed<00:01:23.090> settings

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
and change the power and speed settings

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.890 
and change the power and speed settings
and<00:01:24.220> make<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.400> bit<00:01:25.640> better

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.180 

okay<00:01:29.900> I've<00:01:30.020> adjusted<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.470> speed<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.010> power

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
okay I've adjusted the speed and power

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.630 
okay I've adjusted the speed and power
and<00:01:31.840> I'm<00:01:32.840> going<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.080> move<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.590> laser<00:01:34.340> head

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
and I'm going to move the laser head

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.150 
and I'm going to move the laser head
along<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.390> little<00:01:35.570> bit<00:01:35.810> along<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.920> next

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
along a little bit along to the next

00:01:37.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
along a little bit along to the next
position<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.790> strip<00:01:38.120> on<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.450> test<00:01:38.690> strip

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:54.870 

it's<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.810> right

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.120 

well<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.600> can<00:02:55.720> see<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.140> that's<00:02:56.260> much<00:02:56.590> darker

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
well you can see that that's much darker

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.030 
well you can see that that's much darker
now<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.580> that's<00:02:58.240> that's<00:02:58.960> acceptable<00:02:59.470> that's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
now and that's that's acceptable that's

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.130 
now and that's that's acceptable that's
what<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.250> was<00:03:00.430> working<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:01.270> so<00:03:01.840> I'll<00:03:01.930> go<00:03:02.110> ahead

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
what I was working for so I'll go ahead

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.160 
what I was working for so I'll go ahead
and<00:03:02.620> laser<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.850> onto<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.420> actual<00:03:04.570> back<00:03:04.990> of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
and laser that onto the actual back of

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.990 
and laser that onto the actual back of
the<00:03:05.320> guitar<00:03:05.470> now<00:03:08.010> okay<00:03:09.010> I'm<00:03:09.190> already<00:03:09.490> set<00:03:09.880> up

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
the guitar now okay I'm already set up

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.310 
the guitar now okay I'm already set up
here<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.220> laser<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.640> back<00:03:12.790> script

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
here to do the laser on the back script

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.380 
here to do the laser on the back script
notice<00:03:14.320> you<00:03:14.890> might<00:03:15.070> notice<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.400> I've

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
notice you might notice that I've

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.920 
notice you might notice that I've
changed<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.930> lens<00:03:17.110> from<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.340> test<00:03:19.210> strips

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
changed the lens from the test strips

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.920 
changed the lens from the test strips
because<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:21.130> course<00:03:21.400> I'd<00:03:22.360> forgotten<00:03:22.780> about

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
because of course I'd forgotten about

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.760 
because of course I'd forgotten about
the<00:03:23.350> height<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.220> brace<00:03:25.000> bars<00:03:25.560> which<00:03:26.560> we're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
the height of the brace bars which we're

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.100 
the height of the brace bars which we're
going<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> get<00:03:27.070> in<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.310> way<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.670> laser

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
going to get in the way of the laser

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.800 
going to get in the way of the laser
transitioning<00:03:29.110> from<00:03:29.230> left<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.810> I've

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
transitioning from left to right so I've

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.020 
transitioning from left to right so I've
changed<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> set<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.250> two<00:03:33.460> inch<00:03:33.610> focus

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
changed it for a set of a two inch focus

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.230 
changed it for a set of a two inch focus
length<00:03:34.240> lens<00:03:34.960> for<00:03:35.650> for<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.310> four<00:03:36.640> inch<00:03:36.790> focus

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
length lens for for a four inch focus

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.550 
length lens for for a four inch focus
length<00:03:37.480> lens<00:03:37.780> without<00:03:38.200> any<00:03:39.060> autofocus

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
length lens without any autofocus

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.220 
length lens without any autofocus
gubbins<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.770> it<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.130> it's<00:03:42.880> going<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> be<00:03:43.780> much

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
gubbins on it and it's going to be much

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.580 
gubbins on it and it's going to be much
easier<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:46.720> just<00:03:46.870> going<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.080> float<00:03:47.290> well

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
easier it's just going to float well

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.080 
easier it's just going to float well
above<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:47.980> as<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.190> can<00:03:48.310> see<00:03:48.490> there's<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.760> big

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
above it as you can see there's a big

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.910 
above it as you can see there's a big
four<00:03:49.300> inch<00:03:49.450> gap<00:03:49.720> between<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.260> work<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
four inch gap between the work and the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.590 
four inch gap between the work and the
laser<00:03:51.360> head<00:03:52.360> now<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:54.400> I'll<00:03:55.090> go<00:03:55.420> ahead<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:57.600> miss

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
laser head now so I'll go ahead and miss

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.450 
laser head now so I'll go ahead and miss
the<00:03:58.810> point<00:03:59.020> of<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.530> see<00:03:59.800> that's<00:03:59.920> right<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
the point of you see that's right in the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.080 
the point of you see that's right in the
middle<00:04:00.490> of<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.750> middle<00:04:02.110> strip<00:04:02.880> not<00:04:03.880> stuff

middle of that middle strip not stuff

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:52.400 
middle of that middle strip not stuff
that<00:04:04.120> shows<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.750> video<00:04:04.990> there<00:04:05.920> we<00:04:06.010> go

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.020 

we<00:04:52.890> are<00:04:53.130> all<00:04:53.310> done
