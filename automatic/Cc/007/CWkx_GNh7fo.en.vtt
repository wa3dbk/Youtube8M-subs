start with the easiest part of the
puzzle<00:01:10.380> first

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
puzzle first

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.100 
puzzle first
so<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> usually<00:01:11.910> start<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.630> outline

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so you usually start with that outline

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.430 
so you usually start with that outline
or<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.500> border<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.360> Pocoyo<00:01:15.360> space<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.050> very
