direction and the realizer which was
always<00:02:11.230> there

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.420 

we<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.799> sync<00:02:29.220> tracks<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.980> course<00:02:32.280> with

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
we can sync tracks and of course with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.089 
we can sync tracks and of course with
fader<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:38.989> we<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.170> click<00:02:40.439> on<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> waveform

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
fader and we can click on the waveform

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:54.750 
fader and we can click on the waveform
and<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.549> will<00:02:41.849> try<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.359> say<00:02:43.579> synced

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.190 

girls<00:02:55.390> sing<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.409> again<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.870> fine-tuned<00:02:58.870> by

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
so we can zoom into the wait for them

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.430 
so we can zoom into the wait for them
this<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.240> of<00:03:27.390> course<00:03:27.420> where<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.990> can<00:03:28.140> scratch

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
this is of course where you can scratch

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.940 
this is of course where you can scratch
too<00:03:29.630> will<00:03:30.630> find<00:03:30.930> control<00:03:31.290> for<00:03:31.590> 72<00:03:31.980> points<00:03:32.220> etc

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
too will find control for 72 points etc

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:43.160 
too will find control for 72 points etc
now<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.010> can<00:03:37.850> rewind<00:03:39.680> fast<00:03:40.680> forward<00:03:42.170> maybe

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
now you can rewind fast forward maybe

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
into this you can adjust this speed and

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.370 
into this you can adjust this speed and

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
at the range 0 iron although they will

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.060 
at the range 0 iron although they will
go<00:06:11.090> so<00:06:12.290> this<00:06:13.290> is<00:06:13.830> huge<00:06:14.190> send<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.240> up<00:06:15.360> to<00:06:15.390> 75<00:06:16.110> she

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
go so this is huge send it up to 75 she

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:24.239 
go so this is huge send it up to 75 she
sent<00:06:17.310> never<00:06:17.520> down<00:06:17.729> there<00:06:17.940> so

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.939 

move<00:06:25.249> and<00:06:26.120> make<00:06:26.509> it<00:06:26.629> wild<00:06:27.050> pitch<00:06:27.349> pitch

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
move and make it wild pitch pitch

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:39.219 
move and make it wild pitch pitch
correction<00:06:37.629> transitions<00:06:38.629> for<00:06:38.779> the<00:06:38.960> older

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
correction transitions for the older

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:46.809 
correction transitions for the older
transitions<00:06:40.990> and<00:06:43.300> in<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:45.430> it<00:06:46.430> can<00:06:46.610> have<00:06:46.789> a

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
transitions and in the it can have a

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.189 
transitions and in the it can have a
more<00:06:47.180> precise<00:06:48.729> analysis<00:06:49.729> of<00:06:49.969> each<00:06:50.120> track<00:06:50.479> when

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
more precise analysis of each track when

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.959 
more precise analysis of each track when
you<00:06:51.289> load<00:06:51.499> it<00:06:51.650> will<00:06:52.039> take<00:06:52.250> a<00:06:52.279> couple<00:06:52.520> of

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969 
you load it will take a couple of

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.339 
you load it will take a couple of
seconds<00:06:53.419> and<00:06:53.680> use<00:06:54.680> the<00:06:54.860> iPad<00:06:55.189> use<00:06:55.430> power<00:06:56.349> to

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
seconds and use the iPad use power to

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:01.769 
seconds and use the iPad use power to
more<00:06:58.069> precisely<00:06:58.539> guess<00:06:59.539> the<00:07:00.020> BPM<00:07:00.500> yeah<00:07:01.460> a

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:01.779 
more precisely guess the BPM yeah a

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:05.379 
more precisely guess the BPM yeah a
great<00:07:02.779> great<00:07:03.379> little<00:07:03.710> application<00:07:04.490> snow<00:07:05.240> only

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389 
great great little application snow only

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.610 
great great little application snow only
twenty<00:07:05.900> dollars<00:07:06.289> so<00:07:06.729> it's<00:07:08.319> reduced<00:07:09.319> their

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
twenty dollars so it's reduced their

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.980 
twenty dollars so it's reduced their
 Leona<00:07:10.069> products<00:07:11.029> to<00:07:11.180> ten<00:07:11.479> dollars

because it won't price it w/o IDC for

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:20.170 
because it won't price it w/o IDC for
the<00:07:15.379> design<00:07:15.830> of<00:07:16.749> the<00:07:17.749> app<00:07:17.870> so<00:07:18.259> yeah<00:07:18.939> you<00:07:19.939> can<00:07:20.089> do

the design of the app so yeah you can do

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.600 
the design of the app so yeah you can do
a<00:07:20.210> lot<00:07:20.419> with<00:07:20.479> it<00:07:20.719> the<00:07:21.620> closest<00:07:21.979> I've<00:07:22.129> gotten<00:07:22.580> to
