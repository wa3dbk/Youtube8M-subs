00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
around since nineteen fifty-six all of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.499 
around since nineteen fifty-six all of
those<00:02:08.399> lenses<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
those lenses are good on that do you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.699 
those lenses are good on that do you
know<00:02:09.599> why<00:02:09.750> I'm<00:02:10.050> taking<00:02:10.170> an<00:02:10.349> interesting

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
know why I'm taking an interesting

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.960 
know why I'm taking an interesting
reason<00:02:10.979> why<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
reason why the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.300 
reason why the
empty<00:02:12.180> shake<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:12.900> built<00:02:13.410> into<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.830> body<00:02:14.070> of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
empty shake is built into the body of

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.340 
empty shake is built into the body of
the<00:02:14.430> camera<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.450> lens<00:02:15.690> yeah<00:02:16.050> other

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the camera not the lens yeah other

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.900 
the camera not the lens yeah other
digital<00:02:16.860> cameras<00:02:17.190> build<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.460> anti<00:02:17.730> shake

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
digital cameras build the anti shake

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
digital cameras build the anti shake
into<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> lens<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.110> their<00:02:19.290> lenses<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:19.800> very

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
into the lens so their lenses are very

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.830 
into the lens so their lenses are very
expensive<00:02:20.220> these<00:02:20.550> lenses<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:21.210> about<00:02:21.570> half

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
expensive these lenses are about half

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.210 
expensive these lenses are about half
the<00:02:22.020> price<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.530> great<00:02:22.770> thing<00:02:22.800> about<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the price and the great thing about that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.180 
the price and the great thing about that
if<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.880> want<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.390> 400<00:02:25.140> time<00:02:25.320> optical<00:02:25.860> zoom<00:02:25.890> out

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
if you want a 400 time optical zoom out

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.040 
if you want a 400 time optical zoom out
let's<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.550> reasonable<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.060> 40<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:27.720> optical

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
let's be reasonable a 40 time optical

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.600 
let's be reasonable a 40 time optical
zoom<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.440> something<00:02:28.710> like<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.460> have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
zoom or something like that you can have

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.030 
zoom or something like that you can have
those<00:02:29.760> incredible<00:02:30.180> tella<00:02:30.590> telephoto<00:02:31.590> lenses

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
those incredible tella telephoto lenses

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.450 
those incredible tella telephoto lenses
this<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.640> an<00:02:32.760> 18<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.270> 55<00:02:33.570> millimeter<00:02:34.200> lens<00:02:34.920> so

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
this is an 18 to 55 millimeter lens so

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.520 
this is an 18 to 55 millimeter lens so
it<00:02:35.550> goes<00:02:35.700> from<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.000> pretty<00:02:36.480> nice<00:02:36.660> wide<00:02:36.990> angle<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it goes from a pretty nice wide angle to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.350 
it goes from a pretty nice wide angle to
a<00:02:37.560> pretty<00:02:37.890> nice<00:02:38.070> sort<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.370> semi<00:02:38.700> telephoto

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
a pretty nice sort of semi telephoto

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.510 
a pretty nice sort of semi telephoto
shot<00:02:39.750> another<00:02:40.500> thing<00:02:40.830> about<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.280> it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
shot another thing about this is it

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.940 
shot another thing about this is it
really<00:02:41.940> really<00:02:42.180> cool<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.930> takes<00:02:43.170> six<00:02:43.560> frames

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
really really cool this takes six frames

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280 
really really cool this takes six frames
per<00:02:44.310> second<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.180> reason<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.720> takes<00:02:45.840> pictures

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
per second the reason it takes pictures

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.320 
per second the reason it takes pictures
so<00:02:46.530> quickly<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.150> what's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
so quickly is because this is what's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.930 
so quickly is because this is what's
called<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.600> mirrorless<00:02:49.200> SLR<00:02:49.950> most<00:02:50.250> SLR<00:02:50.670> style

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
called a mirrorless SLR most SLR style

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.510 
called a mirrorless SLR most SLR style
cameras<00:02:51.450> or<00:02:51.600> SLR<00:02:52.170> cameras<00:02:52.590> pardon<00:02:52.950> me<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.490> a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
cameras or SLR cameras pardon me have a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.580 
cameras or SLR cameras pardon me have a
mirror<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.209> them<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.990> mirror<00:02:55.290> has<00:02:55.560> two

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
mirror in them so the mirror has two

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
mirror in them so the mirror has two
when<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> hold<00:02:56.280> down<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.700> shutter<00:02:57.000> button

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
when you hold down the shutter button

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.970 
when you hold down the shutter button
like<00:02:58.020> I'm<00:02:58.170> holding<00:02:58.350> down<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> shutter<00:02:58.860> button

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
like I'm holding down the shutter button

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.850 
like I'm holding down the shutter button
right<00:02:59.310> now<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.940> mirror<00:03:00.390> has<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.260> move<00:03:01.500> every

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
right now the mirror has to move every

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.500 
right now the mirror has to move every
time<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.100> take<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> shot<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.970> doesn't<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.450> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
time you take a shot it doesn't have to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.660 
time you take a shot it doesn't have to
move<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.350> what<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.650> means<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.370> it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
move with this and what that means is it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.000 
move with this and what that means is it
can<00:03:06.180> take<00:03:06.390> those<00:03:06.630> six<00:03:06.959> frames<00:03:07.200> per<00:03:07.440> second<00:03:07.860> at

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
can take those six frames per second at

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.750 
can take those six frames per second at
a<00:03:08.280> full<00:03:09.080> 16<00:03:10.220> megapixels<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.670> take

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
a full 16 megapixels and it can take

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.890 
a full 16 megapixels and it can take
them<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.030> long<00:03:12.180> as<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.450> hold<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.720> shutter
