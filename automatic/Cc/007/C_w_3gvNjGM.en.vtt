00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 I have 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.840
 it is something completely new that became something 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.270
 never done before is all singing 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 because every recording live them like that 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.180
 consistently, film has never been sung 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.430
 implemented the idea of ​​singing live 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.310
 is scary but you win 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.840
 this freedom 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.400
 we have wonderful actors 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.330
 found the music to play 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.400
 hide 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.900
 but that works only by using them 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.360
 at the right moment just liu making 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.950
 a piece of a normal musical we 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.150
 actor go into the studio and enter 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.430
 record album 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.989
 because after two months we can 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.360
 to turn and would be in front of the camera 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.769
 playback singing at the laim alongside the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.660
 the problem is that you play all games 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.400
 decisions three months before 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.290
 Before you meet your colleagues 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.750
 get to know olives with back to work 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.580
 through a live recording allows us 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.519
 Tom the spontaneity of a normal 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.159
 filming for marketing youth you can feel 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.570
 instinctively the spurious on the playback for 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.280
 the audience will be excited about it 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.850
 Experience the live singing on the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 By virtue of history, a big impact 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:48.500
 Held it sounds like it sung again 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:50.420
 it is also so far cry michael gruber 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.920
 I do not take breaks or keep on watching 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.050
 times faster times slower 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.050
 I had to pay attention to the acting 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.800
 the actors have earphones over 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.720
 this live a pianist though 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.670
 the actors determine the tempo and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.670
 no soundtrack recorded before 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.950
 afterwards the piano is replaced by a 70 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.950
 man replaced strong orchestra 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.280
 Of course, everything has to be done 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.150
 many of us are quite free in it 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.150
 to feel better 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.390
 it has so much more power one is free 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.310
 has total control of love scenes 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.890
 one wishes otherwise always music to 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.020
 to be able to play 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.950
 here you have the piano in the ear main 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:58.620
 lives the music 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:00.270
 It almost makes you cry 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.890
 this way of working connects the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:09.060
 Vulnerability of the voice with the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.470
 emotional content of the text trailer 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.630
 when I saw the trailer and 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.220
 Fragile voice heard with this 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.530
 song that I thought I knew so well 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.640
 or was it like listening to the text? 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.900
 first time somehow selfish 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.380
 opt for a nice version too 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.380
 decide 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.799
 she is desperately stuck in one 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.549
 deep hole from which you never again 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.530
 come out 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.569
 So I just put that in the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.230
 mailing and waiting for what happens here 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.230
 reported 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.439
 I need a fabric for her miserable 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.439
 really a lack and immediate 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.140
 one sings much more emotionally than it does in the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.140
 studio would be possible 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.130
 I saw in it the unique chance of something 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.130
 to create groundbreaking 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.590
 how miserable 2013 in the cinema
