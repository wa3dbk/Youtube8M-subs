00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
system and how that works for us we have

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.740 
system and how that works for us we have
a<00:00:11.940> really<00:00:12.230> bad<00:00:13.230> well<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.700> runs<00:00:14.940> almost<00:00:15.210> pure

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
system that we use to go kind of a

in<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.800> growing<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:54.949> imagine<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in this growing up I imagine the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
in this growing up I imagine the
grandkids<00:00:56.370> will<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.079> but<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.170> live<00:00:58.379> next<00:00:58.559> door

to a great big lake so usually the pond
water<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> nicer<00:01:04.799> though<00:01:05.450> that's<00:01:06.450> six<00:01:06.720> feet

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
water is nicer though that's six feet

in the ground you see the creek is not
running<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:38.600> coming<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.930> this

running right now and coming out of this
footbridge<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:43.259> runs<00:01:43.560> probably<00:01:44.159> five

months out of the year

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
months out of the year
it's<00:01:47.399> run<00:01:47.869> for<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> few<00:01:49.140> weeks<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.649> it's

it's run for a few weeks now but it's
not<00:01:50.189> running<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:51.259> literally<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.380> far

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
not running right now literally as far

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.639 
not running right now literally as far
as<00:01:52.770> our<00:01:52.920> wet<00:01:53.130> seasons<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.710> water<00:01:57.649> this

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
as our wet seasons that are water this

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.569 
as our wet seasons that are water this
is<00:01:58.860> flowing<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.549> from<00:01:59.850> under<00:02:00.180> there

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
is flowing out from under there

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.349 
is flowing out from under there
the<00:02:02.579> Springboks<00:02:04.490> see<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.909> good<00:02:06.090> flow<00:02:06.329> of

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
the Springboks see that's a good flow of

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.210 
the Springboks see that's a good flow of
water<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:09.300> doesn't<00:02:09.720> change<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.800> runs

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
water that doesn't change that runs

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.660 
water that doesn't change that runs
year-round<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:14.489> that's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
year-round just like that and that's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.589 
year-round just like that and that's
more<00:02:14.970> than<00:02:15.120> enough<00:02:15.150> water<00:02:15.629> for<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:18.180> our<00:02:18.299> needs

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
more than enough water for for our needs

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.820 
more than enough water for for our needs
so<00:02:19.519> have<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:23.390> 2000<00:02:24.390> gallon<00:02:24.750> tank<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.680> I'm

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
so have a 2000 gallon tank that I'm

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.559 
so have a 2000 gallon tank that I'm
standing<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.799> there's<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:30.260> pump<00:02:32.569> it

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
standing right now and there's a pump it

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.289 
standing right now and there's a pump it
pressurizes<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.650> tank<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.400> pushes

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
pressurizes that tank and that pushes

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.350 
pressurizes that tank and that pushes
the<00:02:36.450> water<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.410> house<00:02:37.620> or<00:02:38.069> up<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> big

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the water up to the house or up to a big

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.280 
the water up to the house or up to a big
tank<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> mountain<00:02:41.599> 2500<00:02:42.599> gallon<00:02:42.959> tank

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
tank up on the mountain 2500 gallon tank

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.289 
tank up on the mountain 2500 gallon tank
up<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.069> mountain<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.459> gravity<00:02:45.090> feed

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
up on the mountain for gravity feed

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.280 
up on the mountain for gravity feed
water<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.650> what<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:46.829> have<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:48.349> oops

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
winter time we haven't ever had to use

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.740 
winter time we haven't ever had to use
it<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.359> for<00:03:25.459> irrigation<00:03:26.459> purposes<00:03:26.750> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it just for irrigation purposes that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.440 
it just for irrigation purposes that
would<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:28.049> firing<00:03:28.379> this<00:03:29.099> other<00:03:29.400> pump<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.970> just

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
would be firing this other pump the just

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.399 
would be firing this other pump the just
turned<00:03:30.690> off<00:03:31.040> for<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.129> irrigation<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.319> a

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
turned off for the irrigation so in a

turned off for the irrigation so in a
long-term<00:03:34.650> grid<00:03:35.220> down<00:03:35.400> situation<00:03:36.209> what<00:03:36.359> we'd

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
long-term grid down situation what we'd

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.559 
long-term grid down situation what we'd
have<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.379> fire<00:03:37.709> up<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.069> diesel<00:03:38.400> generator

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
have to do is fire up a diesel generator

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.930 
have to do is fire up a diesel generator
to<00:03:39.569> pump<00:03:39.840> water<00:03:40.019> once<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.859> month<00:03:41.040> up<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
to pump water once a month up on the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.360 
to pump water once a month up on the
upper<00:03:42.180> tank<00:03:43.549> which<00:03:44.549> would<00:03:44.730> be<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.879> hassle<00:03:45.090> but

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
upper tank which would be a hassle but

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.160 
upper tank which would be a hassle but
hope<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.549> don't<00:03:47.730> ever<00:03:47.819> have<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:49.019> other

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
hope we don't ever have to the other

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.740 
hope we don't ever have to the other
thing<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> have<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.280> couple<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.940> solar<00:03:51.209> panels

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
thing is I have a couple of solar panels

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.629 
thing is I have a couple of solar panels
and<00:03:52.879> two<00:03:54.260> l16<00:03:55.260> batteries<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.220> bring<00:03:56.430> down

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
and two l16 batteries I can bring down

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.400 
and two l16 batteries I can bring down
here<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:58.069> commercial<00:03:59.069> rated

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
here and I have a commercial rated

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.170 
here and I have a commercial rated
inverter<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:02.010> will<00:04:02.280> actually<00:04:02.760> run<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
inverter that will actually run this

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.819 
inverter that will actually run this
pump<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> could<00:04:04.079> set<00:04:04.290> two<00:04:04.470> solar<00:04:04.739> panels

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
pump and I could set two solar panels

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.699 
pump and I could set two solar panels
out<00:04:05.310> there<00:04:05.579> in<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.849> pasture<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.780> Sun<00:04:07.079> and

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
out there in the pasture in the Sun and

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.369 
out there in the pasture in the Sun and
we<00:04:08.459> could<00:04:08.639> use<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:09.090> pump<00:04:09.510> water<00:04:09.720> up<00:04:10.079> on

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
we could use that to pump water up on

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.379 
we could use that to pump water up on
the<00:04:10.530> mountain<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.310> we<00:04:11.579> were<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.150> place

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
the mountain if we were in the place

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.780 
the mountain if we were in the place
where<00:04:12.629> we<00:04:12.750> didn't<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.169> any<00:04:13.349> diesel<00:04:14.010> fuel<00:04:14.459> or

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
where we didn't have any diesel fuel or

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.839 
where we didn't have any diesel fuel or
propane<00:04:15.329> or<00:04:15.629> a<00:04:15.660> gasoline<00:04:16.410> we'd<00:04:17.340> still<00:04:17.639> be<00:04:17.760> able

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
propane or a gasoline we'd still be able

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.699 
propane or a gasoline we'd still be able
to<00:04:18.030> pump<00:04:18.180> water<00:04:18.449> up<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.139> mountain<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.680> that

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
to pump water up on the mountain so that

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.620 
to pump water up on the mountain so that
inverter<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.430> brand-new<00:04:20.970> sitting<00:04:21.389> on<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.420 
inverter is brand-new sitting on the
shelf<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.169> hope<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.530> don't<00:04:22.590> ever<00:04:22.949> need<00:04:23.220> it

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
shelf I hope I don't ever need it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.300 
shelf I hope I don't ever need it
because<00:04:23.729> it's<00:04:23.910> not<00:04:24.060> very<00:04:24.120> efficient<00:04:25.099> but<00:04:26.099> if<00:04:26.220> I

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
because it's not very efficient but if I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.710 
because it's not very efficient but if I
hook<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.669> up<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> couple<00:04:27.120> l16<00:04:29.570> set<00:04:30.570> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
hook it up to a couple l16 set the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.629 
hook it up to a couple l16 set the

panels out in the Sun it'll definitely

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.570 
panels out in the Sun it'll definitely
fill<00:04:32.849> the<00:04:33.060> 2500<00:04:33.870> gallon<00:04:34.229> tank<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.340> see
