00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.440
 the door in the euroborg this morning were in a tight position with both the press and the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 fans could only catch glimpses of trainer players from outside the stadium 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.359
 to receive 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.539
 we just don't want to make vitesse beyond that 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.099
 they are and 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.589
 sometimes very tricky because the yard always comes in nice people to watch 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:21.480
 and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.369
 that we have to go to the press in a row 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.140
 but for us we certainly felt that given the first competition 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.099
 match is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.770
 and let them still need to play with that and at home 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.720
 she was easily visible on the training field this morning 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.140
 The Belgian arrived from Beijing last weekend and will probably be in it tomorrow 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.660
 team of jans can be deployed as right rear 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.880
 he stopped and it is already from the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.640
 on European soil again on Sunday 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.280
 and that is wrong in the place you see a number of other players 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 imagination in marseille seniors from world leader in the drumptse hof 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.980
 drift here just played again so he came alongside in everyone 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.579
 Martijn Meerdink will play tomorrow due to a foot injury, and certainly not 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.239
 ron jans only this morning during the press talk were welcome anyway 

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.799
 goods 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.740
 to report that opponent vitesse certainly misses three potential basic players 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.390
 including the suspended man also a sansoni and the injured year I think 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.660
 that or I wanted to know how they are going to play and 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.630
 this one 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.920
 but that is actually less important to me, I have everything myself 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.620
 off a bit of butterflies in the belly on Monday morning because the Turks again 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.410
 is starting 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.060
 I think the boys trained very well this week 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.909
 so I'm going to trust him very much to vitesse when the family 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.530
 important role in getting up earlier than danny vitesse on the street 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.980
 pvv not tomorrow from nigeria in the netherlands 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.380
 He will watch the game tomorrow night from the stands in Arnhem 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.270
 since today large pictures of louise laris and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.090
 Kruiswijk gets two players who have since left FC 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.850
 groningen 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.520
 I will post a third photo 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.920
 this one from Marcus Mountain 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 that seems like a bad omen 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.320
 you never know how there are no concrete indications that i don't know 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.450
 anyway 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.210
 and it is known that he would like to grip 2 players we would have with the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.410
 pointed position has priority 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.500
 but there, too, in life there are very few certainties and years that are different 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.830
 we do everything we can for them to wait until the transfer periods 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.049
 the closed 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.549
 what is certain there will often be behind closed doors next season 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.319
 trained 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.949
 It was an exciting season at FC Groningen
