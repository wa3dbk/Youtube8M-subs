00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
to it however in order to do that you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.810 
to it however in order to do that you
need<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:54.110> done<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.440> rears<00:02:54.650> first<00:02:54.980> speed

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
need to have done the rears first speed

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.610 
need to have done the rears first speed
points<00:02:56.210> can<00:02:56.390> also<00:02:56.540> be<00:02:56.810> earned<00:02:57.050> in<00:02:57.200> other<00:02:57.380> ways

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
points can also be earned in other ways

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.370 
points can also be earned in other ways
by<00:02:58.400> taking<00:02:58.670> down<00:02:59.030> traffic<00:03:02.200> reading<00:03:03.200> law

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
by taking down traffic reading law

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.550 
by taking down traffic reading law
enforcement<00:03:04.040> roadblocks

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.460 

getting<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.430> heat<00:03:09.120> level<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.690> rise<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.290> rise

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
getting that heat level to rise and rise

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.550 
getting that heat level to rise and rise
so<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.370> will<00:03:11.520> be<00:03:11.550> more<00:03:12.120> likely<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.569> increase

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
so it will be more likely to increase

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.520 
so it will be more likely to increase
