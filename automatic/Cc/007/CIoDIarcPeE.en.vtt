00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
to do harder how to cut up my hair so I

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.770 
to do harder how to cut up my hair so I
just<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.910> grabbed<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.420> pull

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780

your<00:00:42.930> hair<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.710> guess

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.920 

then<00:00:54.240> you<00:00:54.480> gotta<00:00:54.720> get<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.380> effect<00:00:55.950> I<00:00:56.310> guess

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
then you gotta get this effect I guess

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
then you gotta get this effect I guess
kind<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.050> expiry<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.800> minute<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.250> that's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
kind of expiry for a minute but that's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.380 
kind of expiry for a minute but that's
okay<00:01:00.000> um<00:01:00.630> I<00:01:04.160> usually<00:01:05.160> use<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.760> brush<00:01:06.030> for

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.760 
okay um I usually use this brush for
teasing<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> has<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
teasing just because it has like the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
teasing just because it has like the
little<00:01:08.750> fluffy<00:01:09.750> bristles<00:01:10.580> underneath<00:01:11.580> ah<00:01:11.960> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
little fluffy bristles underneath ah so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.219 
little fluffy bristles underneath ah so
I<00:01:16.610> went<00:01:17.610> by<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> way<00:01:18.240> usually<00:01:18.660> I<00:01:19.140> have
