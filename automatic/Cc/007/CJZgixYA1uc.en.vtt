00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 then all I managed to cut out for myself 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.430
 five minutes to make this video for you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.440
 because I saw that interested 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.500
 really a lot of you and then 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 here I am talking about the famous ones 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.009
 nail supplements and therefore for i 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 hair since they are connected 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.619
 then I try not to lose anymore 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.660
 chatter to get straight to the point 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.330
 but first I must obviously do one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820
 important promise I am about to tell you about 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.380
 food supplements that do not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 they require the commitment to be 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.619
 purchased but of course I do not assume 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.179
 no responsibility in the sense that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 I refer to the intelligence of the person 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.840
 who is listening to the video if he thinks of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.040
 need one of these 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 supplements 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.149
 maybe if he knows he has intolerances 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 of particular allergies or if you do not have 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 never hired a supplement anyway 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.180
 contact your doctor for 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.039
 ask anyway if he can take them if 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.360
 he can't take them 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.789
 I think this did not promise 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.879
 quite even foolish though it is always 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.809
 in other words, better to do it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.090
 let's start right away 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 you remember I had healthy nails 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.359
 and strong suffered from severe stress 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.640
 now they are beautiful because anyway 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.130
 I went to school to become unique 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.110
 technique and there every day he takes away 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.320
 in short, reconstruction for two months e 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.750
 half so three months you want or don't want them 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 nails then get ruined at first not 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 I was very practical then file but rivals 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 she but the florence but obviously they are 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.400
 weakened a lot then I had 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.710
 the exam on July 31st 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.770
 I removed all the reconstruction two 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.150
 days before completely eliminated the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.909
 margin of free or regrowth 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.799
 and applied the semi permanent because I have 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.740
 mine unfortunately made me a little bit 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.299
 bad very thinned a little too much e 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 let's make the area where on the tip 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.579
 mainly the area also hurts 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 it annoys me to touch things 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.290
 so I had to open it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.890
 with some semi permanent however 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.049
 have some sort of protection over today 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.320
 we are all 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.130
 to 12 of August therefore two are passed 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.020
 weeks I had my own nails 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 pearl therefore I had no longer 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.370
 then I finished one this morning 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.120
 so the packaging is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.400
 10 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.360
 I've been taking supplements for ten days 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.129
 so in the end it wasn't either 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.260
 very much if we think about it 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.150
 coming days days in just ten days 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.540
 thanks to integration they have grown 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.980
 so much I want to say in ten days is 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.200
 absolutely a very good result 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.319
 understanding that we are in the summer and in 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.239
 summer our nails grow longer 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.760
 quickly, however, you must also think 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.260
 that I have already removed the seeds anyway 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.940
 permanent that I had first given up 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.370
 this stringy because I didn't want to try 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.800
 and from that anyway I told you that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.150
 they were really the year they had 8 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.510
 completely free margin then 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.900
 I had followed the form of mine 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.610
 fingernail whose of rounded a lot when 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.379
 they went to remove semipermanent 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.790
 I could apply this here I searched 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.239
 to shake it a little so I am 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.500
 been a little filed 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.340
 I must say however some excellent ones 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.690
 results 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.550
 then I spoke to you in another video 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.620
 already how the process works 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.180
 nail growth therefore the famous 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.849
 process carat action so there 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.650
 I repeat to you so as not to bore you then 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.540
 our supplements must contain 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 substances that go to stimulate this 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.280
 process is at school I practically have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.590
 learned that supplements based on 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 lime you find these things are used here 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.030
 but for example nails are not what they are 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.920
 then composed who knows how much from football 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.690
 so football is not what helps it then 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.519
 so much what really helps 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.200
 with vitamin h or the famous biotin 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.090
 so you just go to the pharmacy and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.890
 ask for it biotin-based supplement 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.540
 I do not advise you, in short, the biasca 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.569
 lines is the most famous one is what 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.310
 they usually propose you in the pharmacy 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.109
 I don't recommend it but not because maybe 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.659
 it is not good but simply because it is 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.150
 very much advertised as a product 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.069
 and then to a little his place you play 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.540
 less advertised supplements that 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.249
 contain biotin if you want to spend 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.109
 nor in any case they are the same 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.939
 valid so the important thing is that there is 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.620
 this famous vitamin h inside 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.959
 obviously make your nails grow longer 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.700
 quickly means to grow too 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.470
 hair faster because they are 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.079
 tied hair is composed of 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.389
 so keratin was more or less 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.380
 they are very very similar then 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.759
 the supplement of course for me nails 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.259
 it made me grow much more 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.610
 quickly even the hair 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.990
 oh well now you see them all a bit 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.139
 how many formless because I washed them 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.460
 this morning the attachments with bulletin 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.729
 however you see that I have grown up 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.930
 you don't have so much how they grew up 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.009
 the nails are the fastest I have 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.009
 also grown hair 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.040
 they are stronger 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.290
 then I during the course the first month 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:55.250
 I was taking this here noted 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.289
 the box, however, which I took a while 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.070
 haphazard in the sense that I forgot to 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:03.080
 I didn't follow him to take it 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.960
 with perfection he had me a little 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.660
 helped however in short I have not found 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.130
 these great benefits because I took it 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.990
 I don't know how to say it now 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.830
 what i'm taking 12 days is 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.750
 this guy I had recommended the 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.250
 pharmacist because she had tried it 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.770
 she also told me it worked 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.340
 actually i'm getting along fine though 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:31.180
 they only take 22 of them at 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:33.440
 day in the morning with lots of water and 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.410
 this lasts the packaging this 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.389
 culture on offer launch because it must 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.570
 being a product was on offer 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.940
 there were two active launch boxes 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.039
 twenty euros so in the end I have 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.510
 taken this here there are theses that there 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.849
 claim that the supplements are 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.919
 carcinogens because we are anyway 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.900
 speaking of synthetic substances 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.560
 then if I have to tell you the truth I don't 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.430
 they are too favorable to supplements 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.409
 I prefer to take the substances 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.050
 in fact through the power supply in 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.240
 usually I eat my very best 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.919
 millet is a cereal that helps a lot 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.260
 in fact there are also your own hair 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.400
 supplements based on millet and then 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.560
 really very well 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.139
 obviously the amount we can 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.639
 eating is not the same as we can 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.409
 take with a supplement that is a lot 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.479
 more concentrated in part of the 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.979
 supplements are not to be taken for 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.380
 all the new violence you do 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.139
 your time to heal and then 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.820
 stop also because it's not that we have to 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.870
 replace food supplements 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:37.820
 and above all by introducing the substances 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:40.130
 anyway and let's get to discover a 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.289
 little our metabolism goes 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.479
 understood as aid to be taken for 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.970
 a certain period and then stop a 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.289
 maybe take them back when needed then 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.479
 here if you are 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.279
 a stressful situation or like in mine 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.289
 In fact, you did something that you did 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:57.399
 particularly weakened mine 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:59.779
 in the case of an ok, please contact 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:03.279
 to the aid of an integrator otherwise 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:05.389
 in short, if you don't need it 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.159
 it must be a speech because 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.869
 maybe here you have seen the video and 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.879
 you want to take it too, no this ve 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:12.949
 I sincerely advise against it being here 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:15.080
 they are not drugs but it is still stuff 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.069
 synthetic to introduce into the 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.860
 our organism 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.479
 so according to my point of view if 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.249
 you can avoid it is better then 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.439
 take them only if you have a real one 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:25.729
 need then another thing for the 

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:27.469
 girls this is something they have me 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:30.199
 always said both in pharmacies and 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:32.930
 in herbalists during the cycle 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.939
 of course they must pay if they stop 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.180
 you are taking any supplement 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:40.069
 it is unless they are supplements 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.259
 details that he prescribed you on 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.089
 doctor for something I told you 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:45.529
 how to use them anyway line of 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:48.469
 maximum you can also ask when it is 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:50.330
 that you will not have to buy anyway line 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:52.669
 maximum forward broke during the 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.089
 period of the cycle because it could make you 

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:58.669
 in short, to come to be safer 

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.229
 anyway I hope I have said all if 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.490
 I missed something maybe I add 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.599
 some comics 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.610
 but now I seem to have said 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:06.169
 all I hope to be helpful there 

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.129
 see the next video and meanwhile it 

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:09.639
 they have a big kiss 

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:09.639
