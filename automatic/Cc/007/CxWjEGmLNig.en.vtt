 aeromodelismo is a joke of great people that even has association 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.820
 caipirinha, the airplanes and helicopters cost a lot of money and

 in the afternoon to about four years small airplanes ranging from one to three meters 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.000
 are piloted by means of the remote control some are replicas of airplanes 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 aircraft can reach up to 200 meters of altitude 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.129

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.250
 discovered the curiosities that the pleasure of the sport is me 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.050
 with Dengue models in the city that had 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.500
 the plane I researched a lot 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 and I learned alone some models are powered by ethanol 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.350
 others are electric in the air the aeromodelistas manage to command 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.920
 various maneuvers 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 like lupi 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 and to the free fall in screw 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 are you really going to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.970
 for the time being the sport is practiced in this improvised area 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.520
 but the sport has grown 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.920

 the actress is what we have here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 on the dirt track which is not conducive to the kind of sport she practiced most 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.300
 It would have to be at least takes the hard 100 meters in history that an area 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.870
 excellent proved that you have conditions not scored and do not want to sell
