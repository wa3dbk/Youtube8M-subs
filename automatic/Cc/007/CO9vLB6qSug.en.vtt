capstone experiences of a PSM is that it
culminates<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.440> internship<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.309> so

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
culminates in an internship and so

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
culminates in an internship and so
oftentimes<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.510> leads<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.960> direct

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320

stressed<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> fact<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.760> can't<00:01:14.970> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
stressed the fact that you can't just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060
