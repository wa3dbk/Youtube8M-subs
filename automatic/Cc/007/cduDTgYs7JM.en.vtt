00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we are we have the machines that I have

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
we are we have the machines that I have
unlocked<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.350> far<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.580> from<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
unlocked so far so I think from the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
unlocked so far so I think from the
first<00:00:24.240> three<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:25.410> from<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.949> to

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
first three you have to go from one to

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.599 
first three you have to go from one to
10<00:00:26.510> from<00:00:27.510> 10<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> 15<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> second<00:00:29.460> row

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
10 from 10 to 15 you have the second row

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.840 
10 from 10 to 15 you have the second row
and<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.630> level<00:00:31.170> 20<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> other<00:00:32.730> two

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and then level 20 you have the other two

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.319 
and then level 20 you have the other two
machines<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.079> over<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:35.329> click

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
machines then if you go over one click

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.240 
machines then if you go over one click
on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> air<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> side<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.040> from

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
on the air on the side you can go from

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.350 
on the air on the side you can go from
level<00:00:38.520> 32<00:00:39.239> level<00:00:39.930> 45<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.640> machines<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
level 32 level 45 with more machines in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.459 
level 32 level 45 with more machines in
the<00:00:43.200> future<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.520> I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.270> back<00:00:45.469> now

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the future so I'm going to go back now

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
the future so I'm going to go back now
you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.739> also<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.460> in-app<00:00:47.820> purchase<00:00:48.270> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
you can also do an in-app purchase of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.500 
you can also do an in-app purchase of
coins<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.160> give<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:51.120> coins

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
coins and you can also give some coins

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
coins and you can also give some coins
so<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> way<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.800> works<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.579> pick<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so the way this works is you pick a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.299 
so the way this works is you pick a
machine<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> play<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> once<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.739> coins<00:00:56.010> run

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
machine you play it once your coins run

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.510 
machine you play it once your coins run

out you have to either buy more coins or

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.479 
out you have to either buy more coins or
