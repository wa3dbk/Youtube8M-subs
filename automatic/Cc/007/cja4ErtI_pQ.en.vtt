advantage of scale is its equality of
degrees<00:02:01.009> Celsius<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.520> Kelvin<00:02:01.579> B's<00:02:02.060> degrees

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
degrees Celsius and Kelvin B's degrees

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.690 
degrees Celsius and Kelvin B's degrees
so<00:02:03.320> we<00:02:03.380> can<00:02:03.530> easily<00:02:03.680> switch<00:02:04.100> from<00:02:04.310> one<00:02:04.430> scale

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
so we can easily switch from one scale

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.340 
so we can easily switch from one scale
to<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.060> other<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.689> United<00:02:05.780> States<00:02:06.170> and
