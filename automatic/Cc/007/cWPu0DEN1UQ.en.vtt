00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.590 
about it being easy
what<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.430> put<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:13.910> hand<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
what you just put on my hand is the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.820 
what you just put on my hand is the
appropriate<00:02:14.930> amount<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.560> would<00:02:15.650> say

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
appropriate amount you would say

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.670 
appropriate amount you would say
probably<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.430> sizing<00:02:16.880> yeah<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:18.350> don't

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
probably for your sizing yeah you don't

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.290 
probably for your sizing yeah you don't
want<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.010> go<00:02:19.130> crazy<00:02:19.400> with<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.850> if<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> put

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
want to go crazy with this if you put

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.660 
want to go crazy with this if you put
too<00:02:20.510> much<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:20.930> then<00:02:21.800> it's<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.190> it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
too much on there then it's like it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.430 
too much on there then it's like it
takes<00:02:22.880> forever<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.390> get<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.690> rubbed<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.110> it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
takes forever to get it rubbed in it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.580 
takes forever to get it rubbed in it
actually<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.790> think<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:26.540> kind<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:27.560> a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
actually I think it's kind of like a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.980 
actually I think it's kind of like a
film<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.190> there<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.760> your<00:02:29.660> arms

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
film on there and you have your arms

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.800 
film on there and you have your arms
just<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.290> try<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.680> rid<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.130> stuff<00:02:31.810> so

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
just to try to get rid of the stuff so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.540 
just to try to get rid of the stuff so

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
you want to start off with a very small

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.400 
you want to start off with a very small
amount<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.210> it's<00:02:35.390> kind<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.630> good<00:02:35.810> get<00:02:36.080> an<00:02:36.170> idea

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
on this couch right one of their claims

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.970 
on this couch right one of their claims
is<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.360> if<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.630> use<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.960> consistently<00:03:45.770> it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
is that if you use this consistently it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.710 
is that if you use this consistently it
not<00:03:46.400> only<00:03:46.520> will<00:03:46.790> heal<00:03:47.000> whatever<00:03:47.210> dryness

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
not only will heal whatever dryness

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.540 
not only will heal whatever dryness
you've<00:03:47.840> got<00:03:48.080> but<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.590> also<00:03:48.740> keeps<00:03:49.160> trying<00:03:49.460> this

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
you've got but it also keeps trying this

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.420 
you've got but it also keeps trying this
at<00:03:49.880> bay<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.510> from<00:03:50.870> returning<00:03:51.290> I've<00:03:52.280> been

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
at bay and from returning I've been

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.010 
at bay and from returning I've been
using<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.730> pretty<00:03:52.910> regularly<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.810> think

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
using it pretty regularly and I think

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.290 
using it pretty regularly and I think
I've<00:03:54.230> noticed<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.700> first<00:03:55.880> couple<00:03:56.210> of

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
I've noticed that the first couple of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.140 
I've noticed that the first couple of
times<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.870> used<00:03:57.200> beer<00:03:57.980> brewing<00:03:58.760> equipment

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
times that I used beer brewing equipment

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.690 
times that I used beer brewing equipment
