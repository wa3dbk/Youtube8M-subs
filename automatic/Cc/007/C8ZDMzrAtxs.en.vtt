00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
 here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.350
 He told me this, well, let's go 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 see how it goes from launch and from 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.650
 all that because I'm not so bad at 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.900
 walking I do not think I was pretty 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.339
 well I think that for him he has lost to 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.290
 the sultans for the sultans of 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.970
 monterrey good here we go here does not 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.250
 a lot of time we talked with him because 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.649
 has a craft workshop where he manufactures 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.439
 precisely these gloves and what good 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.970
 that exist because with a release of 

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:59.850
 those grabbing it with your hands can not be 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.549
 see clearly that I am not inviting you to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.009
 know our workshop and the process and 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.869
 so that they see the hands of equal to 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.939
 widget what they know how to do before 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.140
 proudly team baseball him 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.189
 I thank you so much I dropped the ball 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.189
 good joaquin 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.180
 well I'm already here inside the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.250
 Don joaquin garcía workshop and this is 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.300
 the first step here is the skin is of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.870
 which is to select beef skin 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.870
 beef 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.170
 Of course it is the raw material 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.740
 main we use in manufacturing 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.690
 of the glove including beef carnaza 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.150
 the polymers this 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.640
 Wayu cement plastic fabrics 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.160
 that are minimal that form the finish and 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.410
 so we start the process and once 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.140
 we already select what glove model 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.510
 we are going to process very well right now that 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.180
 tell the models good I'm watching 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.940
 here that this is the cut and it's the 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.610
 message already decided which model is going to 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.500
 do the the selecting the materials and 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 the cut begins 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.610
 the cut that good well here this is 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 this is the first truth here is this 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.490
 what is going to be this are the fingers of the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.760
 lining of an economic glove this the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.490
 glove the glove has approximately 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.070
 22 pieces of different shapes that go 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.620
 uniting through sewing and starts 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.040
 to start sewing first the lord 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.990
 we mark them and then we seal them 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.140
 We send from the garment department 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.820
 and sewing here the lady is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.260
 starting the first knowledge 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.480
 exactly she is joining her fingers 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.660
 of the fingers 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 the back of the glove for after the efe 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.960
 join them to the palm we cook the gloves 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.360
 backwards then we send them to a 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.970
 little machine that is to turn finger by 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.730
 finger we iron them we join them through 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.560
 of a material of its own for that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.450
 we say in quartar the fingers to 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 through a material that we will 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.370
 we put the name of alive after 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.830
 the glove is sewn upside down the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.440
 flipped now iron is cut out 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.260
 that I live so that she follows the process 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.510
 of putting the lining or a glove inside 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.400
 from another glove so that 's just what 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.800
 I was going to ask him because I said oh 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.900
 since then only the skin does not have it 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.940
 that having a lining has to have a 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.850
 mattress 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.550
 that is to say 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.040
 When you put the lining in the glove, you 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.900
 put the polymer or felt or cushion or 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.270
 what do you want to call it? 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.340
 which cushioned the blow when the player 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.950
 is practicing playing with the glove 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.150
 very good speaking a bit of history 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.180
 I know that the glove then appeared this to 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.340
 late or mid-19th century truth 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.710
 but you from when it does who in 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.160
 wadowice is good we are from 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.070
 the month of August 1976 we are 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.260
 about to turn 37 years working 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.090
 here in the municipality and with people here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.790
 of our municipality that should work 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.910
 here to the people of the municipality good here 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.910
 we see it already supports almost almost almost is 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.890
 already finished right here they are already in the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.230
 final part of the glove or that cast 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.050
 scratched then this is the part 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.889
 that they are making striped cast 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.780
 that this is the final part before 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.909
 get to the pot the pot is 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.639
 hit the glove in different ways 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.370
 to loosen it later with some coasts 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.190
 this finger by finger for the customer 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.740
 when testing the glove, feel that you are 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.930
 comfortable to your hand because normally the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.110
 people of this region want a glove 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.090
 gentle to go to practice your sport 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.069
 immediately after you buy it 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.870
 The more you use it, the softer it goes 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.960
 be true but it has some duration 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.389
 in the glove look we have experience in 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.520
 even in my files I have gloves 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.430
 of more than 20 years of people who have played 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.550
 with that glove and he has returned for me 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.400
 gallery and this and in other occasions the 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.590
 we have repaired but the glove of much 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.409
 durability is precisely why 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.009
 we sell few that last a long time like this is 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.620
 very well then what a pleasure or joaquin to see 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.210

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.729
 proudly of hualahuises new lion 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.530
 artisanal especially because we see then 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.180
 very few machines more than all are 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.560
 the hands that are doing it in 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.389
 the hands of man true 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.370
 and it's good that they are done here in new 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.160
 Léon truth because I do not know if in other 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.750
 parts of the republic also exist 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.090
