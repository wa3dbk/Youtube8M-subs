there<00:00:04.649> alum<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.399> that's<00:00:05.610> enough<00:00:05.940> often<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.540> do

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
there alum and that's enough often to do

there alum and that's enough often to do
it<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.379> one's<00:00:07.680> even<00:00:07.859> different<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
it but this one's even different it

destroys<00:00:09.180> the<00:00:09.389> enzyme<00:00:09.809> alright<00:00:10.380> oftentimes

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
destroys the enzyme alright oftentimes

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.980 
destroys the enzyme alright oftentimes
it<00:00:11.250> can<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.550> block<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.880> but<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.750> actually

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
it can just block it but this actually

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.410 
it can just block it but this actually
destroys<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.860> enzyme<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.759> does<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.210> that

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
destroys the enzyme how does it do that

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.130 
destroys the enzyme how does it do that
it<00:00:16.320> reacts<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.040> it<00:00:17.910> covalently<00:00:18.779> attached

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.290 

the<00:02:07.830> only<00:02:07.979> way<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:13.350> only<00:02:13.530> thing<00:02:13.680> better<00:02:13.830> than

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
the only way the only thing better than

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.330 
the only way the only thing better than
that<00:02:15.300> fun<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.410> some<00:02:16.650> some<00:02:16.890> organic

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that fun is this some some organic

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.650 
that fun is this some some organic
chemistry<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:17.760> let's<00:02:18.150> finish<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
chemistry so let's finish it on the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.830 
chemistry so let's finish it on the
middle<00:02:18.989> take<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> test
