00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the shield winning toot white /

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
the shield winning toot white /
evolution<00:02:09.000> puts<00:02:09.239> them<00:02:09.420> over<00:02:09.569> very<00:02:10.440> very<00:02:11.069> well

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
evolution puts them over very very well

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.920 
evolution puts them over very very well
obviously<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.000> evolution<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
obviously it's evolution so if the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.370 
obviously it's evolution so if the
shield

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
shield

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.400 
shield
in<00:02:13.440> here<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.100> puts<00:02:14.400> them<00:02:14.610> over<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:15.180> hell<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
in here it puts them over a hell of a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.230 
in here it puts them over a hell of a
lot<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.610> they're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.970> into<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
lot and also they're going into the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120 
lot and also they're going into the
summer<00:02:18.450> when<00:02:18.930> they<00:02:19.110> could<00:02:19.380> possibly<00:02:19.860> turn

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
summer when they could possibly turn

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.220 
summer when they could possibly turn
heel<00:02:20.460> here<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.930> could<00:02:22.170> possibly<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.520> know

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
heel here they could possibly you know

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.310 
heel here they could possibly you know
um<00:02:25.400> what<00:02:26.400> could<00:02:26.580> happen<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.390> one

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
um what could happen here is there one

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.230 
um what could happen here is there one
of<00:02:28.350> maybe<00:02:28.590> Ambrose<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.310> Rollins<00:02:29.550> or<00:02:29.940> even

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
of maybe Ambrose all Rollins or even

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.180 
of maybe Ambrose all Rollins or even
range<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.690> can't<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.110> me<00:02:31.260> rains<00:02:31.560> will<00:02:31.890> turn

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
range I can't see me rains will turn

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.730 
range I can't see me rains will turn
heel<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.150> next<00:02:33.450> month<00:02:33.600> or<00:02:33.810> two<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.620> you've

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
heel in the next month or two so you've

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.650 
heel in the next month or two so you've
got<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.980> build<00:02:35.100> them<00:02:35.310> office<00:02:35.760> much<00:02:36.420> momentum

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
got to build them office much momentum

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.780 
got to build them office much momentum
as<00:02:37.080> possible<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.100> people<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:38.610> actually

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
as possible so people are actually

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.790 
as possible so people are actually
interested<00:02:39.210> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> shield's<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.440> given<00:02:40.710> them

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
interested in the shield's so given them

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.980 
interested in the shield's so given them
a<00:02:40.890> win<00:02:41.070> here<00:02:41.310> makes<00:02:41.940> more<00:02:42.240> people<00:02:42.630> interested

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
a win here makes more people interested

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.960 
a win here makes more people interested
in<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.380> shield<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:44.070> they<00:02:44.460> were<00:02:44.520> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.730> lose

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
in the shield if they were going to lose

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.240 
in the shield if they were going to lose
on<00:02:45.240> Sunday<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:45.990> maybe<00:02:46.290> not<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.710> many<00:02:46.920> people

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
on Sunday then maybe not so many people

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.190 
on Sunday then maybe not so many people
would<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.490> interested<00:02:47.600> interested<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.960> them

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
would be interested interested in them

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.080 
would be interested interested in them
so<00:02:49.650> when<00:02:49.800> they<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:49.980> break<00:02:50.340> them<00:02:50.550> up<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.910> won't

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
so when they do break them up it won't

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.730 
so when they do break them up it won't
feel<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.450> special<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.990> if<00:02:52.170> they<00:02:52.380> were<00:02:52.440> really

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
feel as special as if they were really

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.260 
feel as special as if they were really
over<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> crowd<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:53.880> had<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> lot

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
over with the crowd and they had a lot

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.780 
over with the crowd and they had a lot
of<00:02:54.300> wins<00:02:54.540> behind<00:02:54.960> them<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.620> also<00:02:56.040> evolution

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
of wins behind them and also evolution

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
of wins behind them and also evolution
point<00:02:57.030> over<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.390> shield<00:02:57.660> would<00:02:58.080> do<00:02:58.260> wonders

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
point over the shield would do wonders

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.010 
point over the shield would do wonders
for<00:02:58.950> Dean<00:02:59.430> Ambrose<00:02:59.850> Seth<00:03:00.360> Rollins<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.990> Roman

film<00:03:06.690> i'm<00:03:06.930> not<00:03:07.080> particularly<00:03:07.440> sure<00:03:07.620> it's

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
film i'm not particularly sure it's

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.010 
film i'm not particularly sure it's
called<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.250> not<00:03:08.460> really<00:03:08.640> above<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.090> either<00:03:09.300> it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
called and not really above in either it

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.740 
called and not really above in either it
does<00:03:10.230> come<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.710> August<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.250> first<00:03:11.750> so

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
does come out on August the first so

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.600 
does come out on August the first so
he's<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.380> away<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.920> bit<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.190> do<00:03:14.340> some

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
he's going away for a bit to do some

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.820 
he's going away for a bit to do some
promotion<00:03:14.820> for<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.020> he<00:03:16.200> really<00:03:16.380> won't<00:03:16.650> be

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
promotion for that so he really won't be

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.280 
promotion for that so he really won't be
in<00:03:17.100> evolution<00:03:18.060> it'll<00:03:18.510> pretty<00:03:18.690> much<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.930> just

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
in evolution it'll pretty much be just

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.870 
in evolution it'll pretty much be just
Triple<00:03:19.590> H<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:19.890> Randy<00:03:20.220> Orton<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.670> there's

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
Triple H and Randy Orton and there's

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.790 
Triple H and Randy Orton and there's
that<00:03:21.030> really<00:03:21.270> evolution<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.990> mean<00:03:22.170> at<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
that really evolution I mean at the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.140 
that really evolution I mean at the
moment<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.400> really<00:03:23.580> evolution<00:03:24.060> without

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
moment is it really evolution without

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390 
moment is it really evolution without
Ric<00:03:24.480> Flair<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.350> when<00:03:25.500> Batista<00:03:25.980> isn't<00:03:26.220> going<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
Ric Flair so when Batista isn't going to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.220 
Ric Flair so when Batista isn't going to
be<00:03:26.460> there<00:03:26.660> apparently<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.750> might<00:03:27.990> be<00:03:28.110> his

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
be there apparently this might be his

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.770 
be there apparently this might be his
last<00:03:28.260> event<00:03:28.890> payback<00:03:29.430> say<00:03:30.090> 40<00:03:30.420> stories<00:03:30.630> in

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
last event payback say 40 stories in

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.940 
last event payback say 40 stories in
there<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.080> evolutions<00:03:31.590> pretty<00:03:31.800> much

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
there then evolutions pretty much

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.440 
there then evolutions pretty much
useless<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.640> they're<00:03:32.880> not<00:03:33.030> going<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.300> have

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
useless that they're not going to have

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.060 
useless that they're not going to have
evolution<00:03:33.900> around<00:03:34.170> what<00:03:34.320> Batista<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.920> now

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
evolution around what Batista is it now

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.460 
evolution around what Batista is it now
so<00:03:35.700> maybe<00:03:36.300> they<00:03:36.480> could<00:03:36.660> have<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.020> shield<00:03:37.290> win

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
so maybe they could have the shield win

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.830 
so maybe they could have the shield win
hair<00:03:37.710> and<00:03:37.980> pretty<00:03:38.400> much<00:03:38.550> put<00:03:38.910> put<00:03:39.480> two<00:03:39.630> dead

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
hair and pretty much put put two dead

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.630 
hair and pretty much put put two dead
evolution<00:03:40.650> maybe<00:03:40.830> that'll<00:03:41.100> be<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.280> end<00:03:41.310> of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
evolution maybe that'll be the end of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.100 
evolution maybe that'll be the end of
evolution<00:03:42.240> maybe<00:03:42.390> that's<00:03:42.600> how<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.780> player

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
evolution maybe that's how the player

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.620 
evolution maybe that's how the player
our<00:03:43.350> shield<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.459> Sunday<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
our shield one on Sunday and then the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.150 
our shield one on Sunday and then the
roar<00:03:45.810> after<00:03:46.230> triple<00:03:46.560> height<00:03:46.650> should<00:03:46.830> come<00:03:47.040> out

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
roar after triple height should come out

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.820 
roar after triple height should come out
and<00:03:47.280> say<00:03:47.780> evolutions<00:03:48.780> over<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.440> shield<00:03:49.709> are

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
and say evolutions over the shield are

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.910 
and say evolutions over the shield are
better<00:03:50.010> than<00:03:50.280> me<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:51.540> evolution<00:03:52.260> we<00:03:52.680> can't

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
better than me in evolution we can't

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.590 
better than me in evolution we can't
continue<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:53.640> anymore<00:03:53.970> there<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.390> bat

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
continue of it anymore there the bat

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.050 
continue of it anymore there the bat
faction<00:03:55.170> maybe<00:03:55.830> that's<00:03:56.040> what<00:03:56.160> they'll<00:03:56.310> do<00:03:56.520> but

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
faction maybe that's what they'll do but

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.550 
faction maybe that's what they'll do but
obviously<00:03:57.360> with<00:03:57.480> Batista<00:03:57.959> going<00:03:58.140> away<00:03:58.260> and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
obviously with Batista going away and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890 
obviously with Batista going away and
this<00:03:58.740> being<00:03:58.920> his<00:03:59.070> last<00:03:59.130> event<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.910> Sunday<00:04:00.390> they

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
this being his last event on Sunday they

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.540 
this being his last event on Sunday they
can't<00:04:01.200> have<00:04:01.380> evolution<00:04:01.980> running<00:04:02.250> around

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
can't have evolution running around

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.370 
can't have evolution running around
because<00:04:02.820> it'd<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.090> be<00:04:03.270> two<00:04:03.450> guys<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.050> it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
because it'd just be two guys and it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.560 
because it'd just be two guys and it
would<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.500> look<00:04:04.770> name<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.190> hell<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
would just look name as hell so the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.050 
would just look name as hell so the
shield<00:04:06.870> yes<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.590> shield<00:04:07.830> are<00:04:08.070> winning<00:04:08.850> here

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
shield yes the shield are winning here

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.790 
shield yes the shield are winning here
and<00:04:09.300> one<00:04:09.540> thing<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.930> would<00:04:10.110> like<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.290> point<00:04:10.590> out

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
and one thing I would like to point out

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.830 
and one thing I would like to point out
just<00:04:10.860> as<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> crazy<00:04:11.400> prediction<00:04:12.060> one<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
just as a crazy prediction one of the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.390 
just as a crazy prediction one of the
shield<00:04:13.080> members<00:04:13.440> maybe<00:04:13.650> Dean<00:04:13.890> Ambrose<00:04:14.250> Seth

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
shield members maybe Dean Ambrose Seth

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.760 
shield members maybe Dean Ambrose Seth
Rollins<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.880> Roman<00:04:14.910> reigns<00:04:15.360> could<00:04:16.230> turn<00:04:16.470> heel

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
Rollins and Roman reigns could turn heel

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.830 
Rollins and Roman reigns could turn heel
in<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.100> match<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.549> joint<00:04:18.060> evolution<00:04:18.630> than<00:04:18.750> I

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
in this match and joint evolution than I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.480 
in this match and joint evolution than I
after<00:04:20.239> yeah<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.650> then<00:04:22.650> they<00:04:22.800> continue<00:04:23.340> with

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
after yeah and then they continue with

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.670 
after yeah and then they continue with
evolution<00:04:24.090> instead<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.510> Batista<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.500> have

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
evolution instead of Batista you have

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.320 
evolution instead of Batista you have
maybe<00:04:25.890> Seth<00:04:26.220> Rollins<00:04:26.400> or<00:04:26.729> D<00:04:26.910> number

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
maybe Seth Rollins or D number

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.559 
maybe Seth Rollins or D number
or<00:04:27.740> Roman<00:04:28.740> reigns<00:04:28.979> in<00:04:29.330> evolution<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.419> night

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
or Roman reigns in evolution the night

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.510 
or Roman reigns in evolution the night
after<00:04:30.720> could<00:04:31.470> happen<00:04:31.770> I'm<00:04:31.979> just<00:04:32.189> putting<00:04:32.430> it

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
after could happen I'm just putting it

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.219 
after could happen I'm just putting it
out<00:04:32.610> there<00:04:32.669> because<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.180> could<00:04:33.360> happen<00:04:33.509> but

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
out there because it could happen but

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.230 
out there because it could happen but
for<00:04:34.379> me<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.919> shield<00:04:35.250> will<00:04:35.370> probably<00:04:35.879> win<00:04:36.000> here

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
for me the shield will probably win here

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.999 
for me the shield will probably win here
it<00:04:36.569> will<00:04:36.659> put<00:04:36.900> them<00:04:37.020> over<00:04:37.199> very<00:04:37.620> very<00:04:37.860> well

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
it will put them over very very well

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.920 
it will put them over very very well
give<00:04:38.310> them<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.580> mentum<00:04:38.939> give<00:04:39.120> them<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.449> second

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
give them a mentum give them the second

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.260 
give them a mentum give them the second
win<00:04:40.050> over<00:04:40.289> evolution<00:04:40.949> put<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.729> few<00:04:41.939> to<00:04:42.090> bed

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
win over evolution put the few to bed

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.430 
video on what I think it's going to
happen<00:05:36.120> between<00:05:36.389> Daniel<00:05:36.870> Bryan<00:05:37.259> and

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
happen between Daniel Bryan and

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.409 
happen between Daniel Bryan and
Stephanie<00:05:37.889> McMahon<00:05:37.919> and<00:05:38.279> Brie<00:05:38.340> Bella<00:05:38.699> but<00:05:39.389> I

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
Stephanie McMahon and Brie Bella but I

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.119 
Stephanie McMahon and Brie Bella but I
did<00:05:39.750> not<00:05:39.960> include<00:05:40.199> that<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.590> this<00:05:40.770> video

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
did not include that in this video

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.649 
did not include that in this video
because<00:05:41.310> it's<00:05:41.550> not<00:05:41.699> a<00:05:41.759> match<00:05:42.000> it's<00:05:42.300> just<00:05:42.569> a

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
because it's not a match it's just a

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.999 
because it's not a match it's just a
segment<00:05:43.080> which<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:43.319> honestly<00:05:43.710> don't<00:05:43.889> think

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
segment which I honestly don't think

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.219 
segment which I honestly don't think
should<00:05:44.729> be<00:05:44.849> on<00:05:44.879> the<00:05:45.060> actual<00:05:45.360> pay-per-view<00:05:45.930> but

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
should be on the actual pay-per-view but

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.110 
should be on the actual pay-per-view but
i'll<00:05:46.349> do<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.589> video<00:05:46.830> separate<00:05:47.370> for<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.669> so
