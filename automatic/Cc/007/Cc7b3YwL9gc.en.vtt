00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
this journey because I know a lot of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.130 
this journey because I know a lot of
people<00:00:58.440> after<00:00:59.340> having<00:01:00.030> weight<00:01:00.660> loss<00:01:00.899> surgery

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
people after having weight loss surgery

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
people after having weight loss surgery
and<00:01:01.469> losing<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> weight<00:01:04.040> look<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.250> multiple

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and losing the weight look at multiple

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.800 
and losing the weight look at multiple
different<00:01:07.520> possible<00:01:08.520> options<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.299> plastic

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
different possible options for plastic

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
different possible options for plastic
surgery<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:14.540> guess<00:01:15.650> we'll<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.680> start<00:01:17.040> with

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
surgery so I guess we'll just start with

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.380 
surgery so I guess we'll just start with

to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.170> 155

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
to be 155

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.600 
to be 155
and<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.330> decided<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.620> get<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.799> consult<00:02:15.310> on

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and I just decided to get a consult on

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.860 
and I just decided to get a consult on
plastic<00:02:16.180> surgery<00:02:16.629> due<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.379> some<00:02:18.870> timing

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
plastic surgery due to some timing

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.690 
plastic surgery due to some timing
issues<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.439> my<00:02:20.470> life<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.069> just<00:02:21.189> happened<00:02:21.640> to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
issues in my life that just happened to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.770 
issues in my life that just happened to
kind<00:02:21.939> of<00:02:22.000> work<00:02:22.180> out<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.689> way<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.780> decided

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
kind of work out this way so I decided

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.569 
kind of work out this way so I decided
to<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:26.170> ahead<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.560> go<00:02:26.680> through<00:02:26.709> with<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.159> even

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
to go ahead and go through with it even

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.369 
to go ahead and go through with it even
though<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:28.000> not<00:02:28.030> at<00:02:28.329> my<00:02:28.360> goal<00:02:28.480> weight<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:29.170> did

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
though I'm not at my goal weight I did

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.110 
though I'm not at my goal weight I did
talk<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.860> surgeon<00:02:30.010> about<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.819> asked

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
talk to the surgeon about that and asked

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.259 
talk to the surgeon about that and asked
him<00:02:31.269> if<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.989> should<00:02:32.650> wait<00:02:32.860> until<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.310> lost<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
him if I should wait until I lost the

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.880 
him if I should wait until I lost the
other<00:02:34.690> 15<00:02:35.560> pounds<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.610> wanted<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.890> he

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
other 15 pounds that I wanted to and he

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.530 
other 15 pounds that I wanted to and he
basically<00:02:39.280> told<00:02:39.549> me<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.000> didn't<00:02:40.299> need<00:02:40.390> to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
basically told me that I didn't need to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.780 
basically told me that I didn't need to
lose<00:02:40.720> any<00:02:40.750> more<00:02:40.989> weight<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.010> he<00:02:42.189> thought<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
lose any more weight so he thought and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.050 
lose any more weight so he thought and
that<00:02:43.780> actually<00:02:44.519> performing<00:02:45.519> surgery<00:02:46.030> on

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
that actually performing surgery on

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
that actually performing surgery on
someone<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:47.019> myself<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.769> still<00:02:48.069> has<00:02:49.950> fat

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
someone like myself that still has fat

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.460 
someone like myself that still has fat
underneath<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.879> skin<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.450> better<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
underneath the skin is better for the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.660 
underneath the skin is better for the
plastic<00:02:53.980> surgery<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.700> far<00:02:55.000> as<00:02:55.920> I'm<00:02:56.920> guessing

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
plastic surgery as far as I'm guessing

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.599 
plastic surgery as far as I'm guessing
reattaching<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.739> areas<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.370> healing

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
reattaching the areas and the healing

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.849 
reattaching the areas and the healing
process<00:03:00.940> he<00:03:01.900> said<00:03:02.109> sometimes<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.620> biggest

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
process he said sometimes the biggest

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.830

till they get too thin and then their

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.319 
till they get too thin and then their
skin<00:03:11.859> is<00:03:11.889> just<00:03:12.069> very<00:03:12.459> thin<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:13.030> harder

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
skin is just very thin and it's harder

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.119 
skin is just very thin and it's harder
to<00:03:13.359> work<00:03:13.599> with<00:03:13.659> for<00:03:14.079> them<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> process

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
to work with for them and the process

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.650 
to work with for them and the process
may<00:03:15.250> be<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.430> healing<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.909> longer<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.329> don't

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
may be the healing is longer I don't

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.250 
may be the healing is longer I don't
know<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.019> for<00:03:17.260> sure<00:03:17.319> but<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.720> i<00:03:19.750> will<00:03:20.079> show

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
know that for sure but so i will show

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.460 
know that for sure but so i will show
you<00:03:20.319> my<00:03:20.620> before<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:22.060> i<00:03:22.569> will<00:03:22.720> do<00:03:22.870> my<00:03:22.900> best<00:03:23.199> at

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
you my before and i will do my best at

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.449 
you my before and i will do my best at
documenting<00:03:24.190> my<00:03:25.090> progress<00:03:25.449> thereafter<00:03:29.459> again

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
documenting my progress thereafter again

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.680 
documenting my progress thereafter again
i'm<00:03:30.849> not<00:03:30.879> as<00:03:31.449> thin<00:03:31.690> as<00:03:31.720> some<00:03:32.650> people<00:03:33.690> might

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
i'm not as thin as some people might

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.409 
i'm not as thin as some people might
want<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.169> be<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.680> i<00:03:36.160> guess<00:03:36.609> we'll<00:03:36.819> see<00:03:37.060> what<00:03:37.299> we

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
want to be so i guess we'll see what we

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.939 
want to be so i guess we'll see what we
end<00:03:37.449> up<00:03:37.690> with<00:03:37.750> but<00:03:38.169> like<00:03:38.290> i<00:03:38.349> said<00:03:38.440> i'm<00:03:38.739> going

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
end up with but like i said i'm going

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.159 
end up with but like i said i'm going
off<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.400> recommendations<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> surgeon

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
off the recommendations of the surgeon

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.129 
off the recommendations of the surgeon
that<00:03:41.319> i'm<00:03:41.440> using<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:43.120> said<00:03:43.419> that<00:03:43.629> this<00:03:43.900> would

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
that i'm using that said that this would

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.869 
that i'm using that said that this would
be<00:03:44.169> an<00:03:44.500> ideal<00:03:44.590> time<00:03:44.859> for<00:03:45.129> me<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.579> have<00:03:45.730> this

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
be an ideal time for me to have this

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.960 
be an ideal time for me to have this
procedure<00:03:46.090> done<00:03:46.569> so<00:03:47.129> i<00:03:48.129> guess<00:03:48.639> without

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
procedure done so i guess without

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.409 
procedure done so i guess without
further<00:03:49.120> ado<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.780> will<00:03:50.199> just<00:03:50.410> do<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:51.150> ugly<00:03:52.150> part

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
further ado I will just do the ugly part

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
degrees around however for myself my

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.649

cut all the way around and that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.030 
cut all the way around and that
a<00:04:22.610> incisions<00:04:23.610> will<00:04:23.820> wrap<00:04:24.090> maybe<00:04:25.050> four<00:04:25.650> or<00:04:25.680> five

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
a incisions will wrap maybe four or five

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.360 
a incisions will wrap maybe four or five
inches<00:04:26.340> around<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.060> back<00:04:27.920> but<00:04:28.920> let's<00:04:29.100> see<00:04:29.250> if

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
inches around the back but let's see if

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.620 
inches around the back but let's see if
I<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.490> do<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:29.730> without<00:04:30.000> showing<00:04:30.450> too<00:04:30.600> much

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
I can do this without showing too much

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.430 
I can do this without showing too much
is<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:32.540> some<00:04:33.540> people<00:04:33.960> let's<00:04:34.140> see<00:04:34.260> if<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.410> can

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
is that some people let's see if I can

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.960 
is that some people let's see if I can
back<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.860> actually<00:04:35.310> kind<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.580> get<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:35.910> a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
back up actually kind of get like a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.570

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
you know flabby there's still a layer of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.180 
you know flabby there's still a layer of
fat<00:05:09.510> there<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:10.140> can<00:05:10.320> see<00:05:10.530> it's<00:05:10.680> starting<00:05:10.860> to

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
fat there you can see it's starting to

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.850 
fat there you can see it's starting to
kind<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.270> wrinkle<00:05:12.870> here<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:16.200> is<00:05:16.500> the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
kind of wrinkle here but this is the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.660 
kind of wrinkle here but this is the
portion<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.760> they<00:05:18.450> will<00:05:18.720> be<00:05:19.670> removing

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
portion that they will be removing

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.100 
portion that they will be removing
tomorrow<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:23.030> likely<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.360> incisions<00:05:24.900> will

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
tomorrow so likely the incisions will

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.880 
tomorrow so likely the incisions will
kind<00:05:25.320> of<00:05:25.380> be<00:05:26.780> kind<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.080> shape<00:05:28.560> and

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
kind of be kind of in that shape and
