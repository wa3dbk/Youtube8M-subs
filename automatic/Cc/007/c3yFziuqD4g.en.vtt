00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.760
 the electric guitar is an instrument 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.309
 musical but because it is defined 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.350
 electric because it transforms vibrations 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.310
 of the current ropes and then comes 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.020
 sent to the amplifier and substance for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.780
 emitting music the electric guitar 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.260
 it must produce electricity but how 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.260
 it works 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.000
 here we have the most important parts 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.710
 of them the pick ups are theirs a 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.360
 transforming vibrations into electricity 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.040
 so that they can be sent to a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 amplifier be transformed into 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.600
 sound 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.600
 to learn more about screwdriver 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.020
 the body of the guitar contributes 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.560
 the aesthetics of the instrument but not 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 it affects the sound a lot because it is full 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.080
 unlike the body of a guitar 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 artistic that is hollow 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.330
 the handle of this instrument is fixed 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.190
 to the body with 4 screws along the handle 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.290
 we have the keys and at the end la 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.290
 headstock with ropes sometimes on keys 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.440
 there is a reason if the strings are of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 metal their magnetic properties 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.910
 interact remediation generating 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.110
 electric current that is amplified 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.110
 to produce the sound of the instrument 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.200
 at one end of the strings we have the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.270
 count is a metal lever to the bridge are 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.689
 fasten 3 springs on the back of the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.360
 guitar the metallic lever is known as 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:42.070
 vibrato lever and loosens or tends to 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.720
 strings to create the tremolo effect 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.079
 fantastic but they are trifles compared to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.429
 wonderful task of the pick ups to transform 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.360
 vibrations in electricity 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.670
 basically it's about six 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.689
 magnets wrapped in a lot of copper wire 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.929
 sorting the thread is finer than a hair 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.790
 and wraps around the 7.200 handcuffs 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.289
 times 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.009
 unrolled would cover the length of 8 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.009
 soccer fields 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.489
 these knobs adjust the volume and the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.879
 good here we have the pick picker 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.650
 up the tone knob acts as a filter 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.290
 is an integrated capacitor in this 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.299
 circuit board that eliminates the high 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.609
 frequencies ensuring the guitar a 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:37.340
 warmer sound and full tone and volume 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.920
 but they serve a lot if you don't hear 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.040
 nothing 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.629
 the pick ups are the key indeed 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.730
 they capture the vibrations they need 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.340
 be amplified 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.280
 all thanks to some magnet is one 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.200
 coil 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.800
 these magnets produce a field 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.110
 stable when you play the guitar 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.240
 string vibrations alter the field 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.930
 magnetic inducing a current 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.719
 electric in the cow 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.299
 the current fluctuates in harmony with the 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:15.719
 metal strings playing the string of the 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.349
 this vibrates a frequency of 440 cycles 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.879
 per second or 440 hearts and this transmits 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.019
 an electric current thereof 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.019
 ample frequency cat 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.370
 what is the function of a selector of 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.960
 pick up get a particular sound 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.260
 choosing one or a combination of 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.260
 pick up 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.720
 the pick up closest to the bridge where the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.240
 strings are more tense cup from the sounds to 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.890
 high frequency the one closest to 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.270
 handle where the tension is lower 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.730
 record the bass 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.250
 but an electric guitar is nothing 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.500
 without amplifier 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 this is considered part of the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.880
 tool without the twice products 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.340
 from the ropes would not result in one 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.970
 stadium serves the push before the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.910
 preamp and then 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.950
 of the amp itself plus 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.470
 high is the major sound distortion 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.630
 and the amplifiers are designed for 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.850
 favor the input current 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.359
 overloads the circuits and generates 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.359
 the desired effect 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.870
 the distortion can be so high from 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.139
 induce the strings to vibrate generating an 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.490
 acute feedback 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:40.009
 and the only one served to be able to generate 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.960
 music this type of guitar produces 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.680
 electricity using laws 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.680
 electromagnetism
