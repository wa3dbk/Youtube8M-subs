four screwed in and then slowly tighten
them<00:02:27.799> see<00:02:27.920> how<00:02:28.010> I'm<00:02:28.099> kind<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:28.519> around

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
them see how I'm kind of going around

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.000 
them see how I'm kind of going around
kind<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> wheel<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.440> attach<00:02:30.860> a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
kind of like a wheel when you attach a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.080 
kind of like a wheel when you attach a
wheel<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.430> they<00:02:31.489> don't<00:02:31.640> need<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.849> be<00:02:31.940> that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
wheel and they don't need to be that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.940 
wheel and they don't need to be that
tight<00:02:32.329> once<00:02:32.900> they're<00:02:33.079> all<00:02:33.230> tight<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.769> can

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
tight once they're all tight you can

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.770 
tight once they're all tight you can
actually<00:02:34.310> take<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.940> license<00:02:35.329> plate<00:02:35.569> bracket

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
actually take the license plate bracket

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.699 
actually take the license plate bracket
as<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> single<00:02:37.010> fuse<00:02:37.220> piece<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.730> twist<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.709> to

as a single fuse piece and twist it to

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.490 
as a single fuse piece and twist it to
get<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.040> tow<00:02:40.250> tow<00:02:40.879> hook<00:02:41.090> bolt<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.540> real<00:02:42.260> tight

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
get the tow tow hook bolt in real tight

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.020 
get the tow tow hook bolt in real tight
that's<00:02:42.739> why<00:02:42.890> I'm<00:02:43.129> tightening<00:02:43.459> up<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> tow

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
that's why I'm tightening up the tow

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.729 
that's why I'm tightening up the tow
hook<00:02:44.209> bolt<00:02:44.360> once<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.110> tow<00:02:45.260> hook<00:02:45.410> bolt<00:02:45.620> is

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
hook bolt once the tow hook bolt is

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.630 
hook bolt once the tow hook bolt is
tight<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.519> loosen<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:48.079> screws<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.829> level

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
tight I can loosen the screws and level

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.699 
tight I can loosen the screws and level
the<00:02:49.790> plate<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:51.049> what<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.349> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.530> do

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the plate that's what I'm going to do

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.580 
the plate that's what I'm going to do
here<00:02:51.950> now<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.329> level<00:02:53.780> set<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.109> plate<00:02:54.349> and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
here now we can level set the plate and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.349 
here now we can level set the plate and
then<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.709> retighten<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.519> screws<00:02:55.849> once

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
then you retighten the screws once

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.610 
then you retighten the screws once
you've<00:02:56.510> done<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.989> never<00:02:57.140> have<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.470> touch

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
you've done that you never have to touch

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.619 
you've done that you never have to touch
it<00:02:57.829> again<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.159> can<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.459> unscrew<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.390> and

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
it again you can just unscrew it and

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.390 
it again you can just unscrew it and
rescrew<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.109> back<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.680> remove<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.310> it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
rescrew it back in to remove it and it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.569 
rescrew it back in to remove it and it
will<00:03:01.519> always<00:03:01.700> come<00:03:01.970> back<00:03:02.150> level<00:03:03.400> step<00:03:04.400> of

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
that's the clearance from the side

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.970 
that's the clearance from the side
here's<00:03:29.930> some<00:03:30.109> shots<00:03:30.379> of<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.590> individual

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
here's some shots of the individual

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.589 
here's some shots of the individual
there's<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.280> tow<00:03:31.430> hook<00:03:31.639> bolt<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.480> the

there's the tow hook bolt and the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.569 
there's the tow hook bolt and the
compression<00:03:33.049> plate<00:03:33.290> here's<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.250> shot<00:03:34.549> from

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
compression plate here's a shot from

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.369 
compression plate here's a shot from
behind<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.419> gives<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:35.690> an<00:03:35.780> idea<00:03:36.019> of<00:03:36.079> what<00:03:36.290> it

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
behind it gives you an idea of what it

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.720 
behind it gives you an idea of what it
looks<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.799> when<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.099> all<00:03:37.220> fabricated

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
looks like when it's all fabricated

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.290 
looks like when it's all fabricated
together

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.670 

I'm<00:03:44.300> often<00:03:44.540> asked<00:03:44.960> what's<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.230> best<00:03:45.320> way<00:03:45.650> to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
I'm often asked what's the best way to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.200 
I'm often asked what's the best way to
tighten<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.160> license<00:03:46.550> plate<00:03:46.760> once<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.060> have

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
tighten the license plate once you have

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.690 
tighten the license plate once you have
it<00:03:47.330> all<00:03:47.420> adjusted<00:03:48.020> so<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.800> resets<00:03:49.490> itself

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
it all adjusted so that it resets itself

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.320 
it all adjusted so that it resets itself
to<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.210> same<00:03:50.420> spot<00:03:50.750> every<00:03:50.780> time<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.970> best<00:03:53.180> way

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
to the same spot every time the best way

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.210 
to the same spot every time the best way
to<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:54.620> when<00:03:54.860> you're<00:03:54.980> going<00:03:55.100> to

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
to do that is when you're going to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.880 
to do that is when you're going to
tighten<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.970> loosen<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.390> up<00:03:56.740> take<00:03:57.740> it

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
tighten it to loosen this up take it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.710 
tighten it to loosen this up take it
from<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.130> halfway<00:03:58.340> point<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.000> bring<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.270> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
from this halfway point and bring it and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.140 
from this halfway point and bring it and
just<00:04:00.050> let<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.350> come<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.400> stop<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.820> its<00:04:02.000> own

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
just let it come to a stop on its own

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.850 
just let it come to a stop on its own
and<00:04:02.450> then<00:04:02.870> from<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.230> point<00:04:03.470> we<00:04:03.650> want<00:04:03.740> to

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
and then from this point we want to

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.920 
and then from this point we want to
tighten<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.370> down

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
tighten it down

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.470 
tighten it down
another<00:04:05.930> 3/8<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.560> an<00:04:06.710> inch<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.670> I'll<00:04:08.180> show<00:04:08.390> you

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
another 3/8 of an inch and I'll show you

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.530 
another 3/8 of an inch and I'll show you
that<00:04:08.750> with<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> measuring<00:04:09.980> tape<00:04:10.270> okay<00:04:11.270> you<00:04:11.330> can

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
that with a measuring tape okay you can

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.590 
that with a measuring tape okay you can
see<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> measuring<00:04:12.950> tape<00:04:13.160> here<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.600> I've

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
see a put a measuring tape here and I've

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.960 
see a put a measuring tape here and I've
adjusted<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.230> look<00:04:15.350> like<00:04:15.590> five<00:04:15.860> inches<00:04:16.160> so

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
adjusted it to look like five inches so

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.220 
adjusted it to look like five inches so
you<00:04:17.060> want<00:04:17.210> to<00:04:17.270> tighten<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.810> over<00:04:17.989> three

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
you want to tighten it in over three

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.770 
you want to tighten it in over three
eighths<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.500> an<00:04:18.650> inch

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:35.649 

there's<00:04:26.780> 3/8<00:04:27.140> of<00:04:27.290> an<00:04:27.410> inch

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.589 

so<00:04:36.659> you<00:04:36.750> can<00:04:36.900> see<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.199> it's<00:04:37.379> level<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.599> it's

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
so you can see that it's level and it's

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:47.089 
so you can see that it's level and it's
actually<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.080> here<00:04:40.289> quite<00:04:40.500> tight<00:04:43.699> so<00:04:44.699> just<00:04:46.099> get

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
actually on here quite tight so just get

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.149 
actually on here quite tight so just get
around<00:04:47.370> till<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.729> stops<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.740> then<00:04:49.919> push<00:04:50.129> it

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
around till it stops and then push it

00:04:50.159 --> 00:05:01.100 
around till it stops and then push it
down<00:04:50.490> another<00:04:50.789> 3/8<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.330> an<00:04:51.479> inch

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.170 

you
