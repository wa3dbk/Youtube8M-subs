car to ventilate itself when it's parked
in<00:01:10.560> hot<00:01:10.800> weather<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.580> inside

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
in hot weather so when you get inside

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.820 
in hot weather so when you get inside
it's<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> bajillion<00:01:13.320> degrees
