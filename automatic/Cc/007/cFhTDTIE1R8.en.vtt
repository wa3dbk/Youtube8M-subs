00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:12.370
 beforehand connecting the phone 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:15.490
 via usb input in nokia suite mode after 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.560
 What do we need in the connections window? 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:23.680
 choose right here sp1 and there will be 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.980

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:34.210

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:38.500
 we select lm 761 after that we press the file with 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.919
 he will pass the program scans the computer 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.050
 for the presence of firmware for our model 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.740
 after scanning it will be written here 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.980

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:04.830
 here you will have several columns and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:08.620
 the first one will be the movie was an update 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.640

 the process takes 10-15 minutes 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.130
 The main thing at this time is not to touch it with your hands 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.229
 Yusb cable is not a phone and a computer is just 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:44.070
 wait so how about if we put 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.810
 the firmware process we can get a corpse 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.630
 the phone doesn't respond to anything just 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.430
 black screen and we all can of course 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.690
 restore it using the same 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.690

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.100
