00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
doing much in blue monkey City since the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.230 
doing much in blue monkey City since the
since<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.049> patch<00:00:07.379> which<00:00:07.710> made<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.849> balloons

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
since the patch which made the balloons

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.310 
since the patch which made the balloons
more<00:00:09.450> spaced<00:00:09.719> out<00:00:09.950> I<00:00:11.000> guess<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.330> mean<00:00:12.750> after<00:00:13.019> you

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
more spaced out I guess I mean after you

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.829 
more spaced out I guess I mean after you
when<00:00:13.590> you've<00:00:13.740> gone<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.519> over<00:00:14.700> like<00:00:14.880> 2,000

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
when you've gone for over like 2,000

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.050 
when you've gone for over like 2,000
tiles<00:00:16.260> at<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:17.160> speed<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.760> then<00:00:17.850> suddenly

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
tiles at one speed and then suddenly

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.220 
tiles at one speed and then suddenly
that<00:00:18.390> speed<00:00:18.980> like<00:00:19.980> Hobbes<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:22.020> kind<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that speed like Hobbes you kind of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.250 
that speed like Hobbes you kind of
notice<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:23.070> mean<00:00:23.640> even<00:00:24.000> Joey's<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.990> really

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
notice it I mean even Joey's not really

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.599 
notice it I mean even Joey's not really
excited<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> moment<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.250> he<00:00:26.400> really

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
excited at the moment but he really

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.730 
excited at the moment but he really
wanted<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.240> hit<00:00:27.449> 3000<00:00:28.050> sales<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.470> that's<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
wanted to hit 3000 sales so that's the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
wanted to hit 3000 sales so that's the
only<00:00:28.769> reason<00:00:29.039> why<00:00:29.279> he's<00:00:29.550> still<00:00:29.730> still<00:00:30.359> going

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
only reason why he's still still going

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.990 
only reason why he's still still going
at<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> moment<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.399> lucky<00:00:32.730> I'm

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
at the moment but me I'm just lucky I'm

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
at the moment but me I'm just lucky I'm
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> break<00:00:33.980> because<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.489> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
going to take a break because this is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.420 
going to take a break because this is
actually<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.570> fixed<00:00:36.960> them

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
actually it's going to be fixed them

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.549 
actually it's going to be fixed them
they're<00:00:38.430> thinking<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.360> ways<00:00:39.480> they<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.840> fix

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
they're thinking about ways they can fix

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.440 
they're thinking about ways they can fix
it<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> rounds<00:00:41.460> aren't<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.879> long<00:00:42.210> anymore

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it so the rounds aren't so long anymore

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.440 
it so the rounds aren't so long anymore
and<00:00:42.860> one<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.239> options

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and one of the one of the options

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.840 
and one of the one of the options
they're<00:00:45.870> thinking<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.190> reversing

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
they're thinking about is just reversing

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
they're thinking about is just reversing
that<00:00:48.000> change<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.469> sure<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.829> someone

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that change I'm not sure if I someone

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
that change I'm not sure if I someone
they're<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> pick<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.820> I've<00:00:50.969> read<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
they're going to pick but I've read that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.240 
they're going to pick but I've read that
that<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.199> considered<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:54.410> well<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that was considered so well for now I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000 
that was considered so well for now I
think<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.989> change<00:00:58.289> even<00:00:58.859> though

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
think I'm what this change even though

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
think I'm what this change even though
it<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.219> annoying<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> made<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> rounds

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
it is annoying that it made the rounds

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.380 
it is annoying that it made the rounds
take<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.109> longer<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:02.070> did<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
take a lot longer it did make the game a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.039 
take a lot longer it did make the game a
lot<00:01:03.690> easier<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:06.000> recommend<00:01:06.299> if

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
lot easier as well so I recommend if

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
lot easier as well so I recommend if
you're<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.799> taking<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.369> break<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.880> me<00:01:09.140> what

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you're not taking a break like me what

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.700 
you're not taking a break like me what
you<00:01:10.229> should<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.950> concentrate<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.360> just

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
you should do is concentrate on just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.899 
you should do is concentrate on just
ignore<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> easy<00:01:14.130> tiles<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.790> go

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
ignore all the easy tiles and just go

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
ignore all the easy tiles and just go
for<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.150> hardest<00:01:15.689> ones<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.220> if

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
for the hardest ones you can because if

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.649 
for the hardest ones you can because if
you<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> way<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.150> are

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you get them out of the way now are

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.820 
you get them out of the way now are
there<00:01:18.780> easy<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.830> well<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.960> guess<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
there easy then well you can guess it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
there easy then well you can guess it's
going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> save<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> trouble<00:01:24.509> later<00:01:24.810> on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
going to save you the trouble later on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.280 
going to save you the trouble later on
so<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:26.549> much<00:01:26.750> when<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> reckon<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> should

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
so pretty much when I reckon you should

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.160 
so pretty much when I reckon you should
all<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.100> first<00:01:29.880> first<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> volcano

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
all do is first first go for the volcano

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.020 
all do is first first go for the volcano

don't<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> can

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
don't know if you if you think you can

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
don't know if you if you think you can
hand<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.710> later<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.189> guess<00:01:56.610> maybe<00:01:56.939> yeah

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
hand them later on I guess maybe yeah

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
hand them later on I guess maybe yeah
but<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> reckon<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.049> should<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.469> volcanoes

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
but I reckon you should go for volcanoes

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.520 
but I reckon you should go for volcanoes
first<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.869> because<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.020> some<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> them

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
first because because like some of them

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
first because because like some of them
aren't<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> bad<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.909> them<00:02:03.030> give<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
aren't that bad but all of them give you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.889 
aren't that bad but all of them give you
a<00:02:03.329> blue<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.570> stone<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.680> great<00:02:04.799> choice

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
a blue in stone so it's a great choice

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
a blue in stone so it's a great choice
another<00:02:06.899> option<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.290> caves<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.009> only<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.489> one

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
another option is caves I only have one

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.390 
another option is caves I only have one
cave<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.420> don't<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.840> why<00:02:10.220> apparently<00:02:11.220> you're

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
cave I don't know why apparently you're

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.230 
cave I don't know why apparently you're
all<00:02:11.520> supposed<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.150> five<00:02:12.450> so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
all supposed to have five so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.870 
all supposed to have five so
but<00:02:13.900> yeah<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.380> beg<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.770> making<00:02:15.370> blown<00:02:15.580> stones

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
but yeah I beg you making blown stones

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.390 
but yeah I beg you making blown stones
as<00:02:16.060> well<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.650> should<00:02:17.830> probably<00:02:17.860> take<00:02:18.250> them

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
as well so you should probably take them

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.070 
as well so you should probably take them
out<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.420> can't<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.900> already

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
out if you if you can't do it already

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.320 
out if you if you can't do it already
but<00:02:21.070> still<00:02:21.280> there's<00:02:21.460> still<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.670> hardtail<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.300> I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
but still there's still a hardtail so I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.690 
but still there's still a hardtail so I
still<00:02:22.450> think<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.720> should<00:02:22.930> anyway<00:02:23.350> um<00:02:23.700> other

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
still think you should anyway um other

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.750 
still think you should anyway um other
than<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.060> just<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.860> specific<00:02:27.460> things

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
than that just not in specific things

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.420 
than that just not in specific things
not<00:02:28.690> specific<00:02:29.290> goal<00:02:29.560> tile<00:02:29.860> times<00:02:30.160> but

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
not specific goal tile times but

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.610 
not specific goal tile times but
specific<00:02:30.910> maps<00:02:31.210> themselves<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:32.440> should

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
specific maps themselves you should

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.460 
specific maps themselves you should
probably<00:02:32.860> go<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.940> butterflies<00:02:34.420> as<00:02:34.720> well

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
probably go for the butterflies as well

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.290 
probably go for the butterflies as well
as<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.070> arrows<00:02:36.400> which<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> desert

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
as the the arrows which are the desert

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.340 
as the the arrows which are the desert
ones<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:39.270> I'll<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:40.450> be<00:02:40.570> up<00:02:40.690> lemak<00:02:41.020> more<00:02:41.200> my

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
ones and I'll just be up lemak more my

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.800 
ones and I'll just be up lemak more my
tracks<00:02:41.680> list<00:02:41.920> um<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:43.270> should<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.630> ones

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
tracks list um they should have ones

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.700 
tracks list um they should have ones
those<00:02:43.960> are<00:02:43.990> all<00:02:44.170> easy<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:45.600> guess<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:47.380> can

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
those are all easy I guess this one can

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.350 
those are all easy I guess this one can
be<00:02:47.740> difficult<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.580> not<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.150> bad

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
be difficult it's not really that bad

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.200 
be difficult it's not really that bad
though<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.930> mean<00:02:50.170> um<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.370> can<00:02:51.550> get<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.000> like

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
though I mean um you can get to like

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.570 
though I mean um you can get to like
round<00:02:52.540> 25<00:02:53.020> using<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.890> ninja<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.400> two

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
round 25 using just one ninja and two

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.450 
round 25 using just one ninja and two
snipers<00:02:54.850> or<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.800> just<00:02:56.980> play<00:02:57.190> right

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
snipers or so so if you just play right

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.640 
snipers or so so if you just play right
you<00:02:57.610> can<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.090> but<00:02:58.270> um<00:02:58.390> some<00:02:59.380> people

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
you can get it but um some people

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.870 
you can get it but um some people
struggle<00:02:59.740> that<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.280> some<00:03:00.520> people<00:03:00.550> struggle

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
struggle that one some people struggle

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.580 
struggle that one some people struggle
of<00:03:01.120> all<00:03:01.270> for<00:03:01.540> us<00:03:01.630> really<00:03:01.840> except<00:03:02.170> for<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.410> Rose

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
of all for us really except for the Rose

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.550 
of all for us really except for the Rose
one<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.460> guess<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.930> these<00:03:05.290> two

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
one so I guess this one and these two

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.530 
one so I guess this one and these two
this<00:03:06.220> one's<00:03:06.430> fairly<00:03:06.730> easy<00:03:07.030> i've<00:03:07.210> got<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> video

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
this one's fairly easy i've got a video

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.510 
this one's fairly easy i've got a video
up<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:08.380> if<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.830> haven't<00:03:08.980> trouble<00:03:09.340> and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
up on that so if you haven't trouble and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.890 
up on that so if you haven't trouble and
just<00:03:09.760> shape<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.210> one<00:03:10.360> out<00:03:11.340> yeah<00:03:12.340> totem<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.570> lot

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
just shape that one out yeah totem a lot

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.480 
just shape that one out yeah totem a lot
of<00:03:14.020> people<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.290> trouble<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.920> so

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
of people have trouble of that so

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.980 
of people have trouble of that so
probably<00:03:16.150> that's<00:03:16.300> one<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.690> ones<00:03:16.840> to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
probably that's one of the ones to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.610 
probably that's one of the ones to
target<00:03:19.020> not<00:03:20.020> really<00:03:20.260> i<00:03:20.290> don't<00:03:20.410> really

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620

personally have troubled many hills but

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.630 
personally have troubled many hills but
i<00:03:22.420> guess<00:03:22.600> this<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.170> kind<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.500> sucks<00:03:23.860> because

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
be the hardest mountain tile but it's

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.010 
be the hardest mountain tile but it's
still<00:03:39.340> not<00:03:39.490> that<00:03:39.550> bad<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.060> yeah<00:03:40.600> if<00:03:40.900> you

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
still not that bad but yeah if you

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.410 
still not that bad but yeah if you
struggle<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:41.590> maybe<00:03:41.770> that<00:03:42.010> one

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
struggle that one maybe that one

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.170 
struggle that one maybe that one
otherwise<00:03:43.420> near<00:03:43.960> um<00:03:44.470> keyhole<00:03:45.400> i<00:03:45.670> managed<00:03:46.150> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
otherwise near um keyhole i managed to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.610 
otherwise near um keyhole i managed to
give<00:03:46.540> brf<00:03:47.470> up<00:03:47.740> on<00:03:48.040> round<00:03:48.580> 18<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.660> know<00:03:49.870> around<00:03:50.080> 17

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
give brf up on round 18 I know around 17

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.870 
give brf up on round 18 I know around 17
i<00:03:50.710> think<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:50.980> was<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.160> keyhole<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:53.580> yeah<00:03:54.580> it's<00:03:54.790> a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
i think it was in keyhole so yeah it's a

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.540 
i think it was in keyhole so yeah it's a
lot<00:03:55.060> easier<00:03:55.120> with<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:56.020> update<00:03:56.290> if<00:03:56.740> via

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
lot easier with this update if via

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.550 
lot easier with this update if via
keyhole<00:03:57.910> saw<00:03:58.150> at<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.450> volcano<00:03:58.750> one's<00:03:59.140> ignore

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
keyhole saw at the volcano one's ignore

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.650 
keyhole saw at the volcano one's ignore
DNA<00:04:00.070> because<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.550> one's<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.000> bad<00:04:01.390> but

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
DNA because that one's not that bad but

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.050 
DNA because that one's not that bad but
yay<00:04:01.930> take<00:04:02.290> on<00:04:02.440> keyhole<00:04:02.860> probably<00:04:03.610> this<00:04:03.730> one<00:04:03.910> as

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
yay take on keyhole probably this one as

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.970 
yay take on keyhole probably this one as
well<00:04:04.210> and<00:04:04.830> maybe<00:04:05.830> this<00:04:06.040> one<00:04:06.310> but<00:04:07.980> depends

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
well and maybe this one but depends

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.050 
well and maybe this one but depends
depends<00:04:09.280> if<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.490> think<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:09.820> can<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.030> it

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
depends if you think you can do it

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.699 
depends if you think you can do it
afterwards<00:04:10.420> are<00:04:10.630> already<00:04:11.140> going<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:11.500> review

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
afterwards are already going for review

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.920 
afterwards are already going for review
beforehand<00:04:12.310> then<00:04:12.670> then<00:04:13.240> you<00:04:13.420> probably<00:04:13.600> find

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
beforehand then then you probably find

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.870 
beforehand then then you probably find
with<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.200> one<00:04:14.320> but<00:04:14.500> yet<00:04:14.620> but<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.490> didn't

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
with that one but yet but I didn't

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.430 
with that one but yet but I didn't
definitely<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.299> think<00:04:16.570> issue<00:04:16.690> target<00:04:17.230> all<00:04:17.320> the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
definitely do think issue target all the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.199 
definitely do think issue target all the
volcano<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:17.920> except<00:04:18.310> for<00:04:18.489> possibly<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:19.000> one

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
volcano is except for possibly this one

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.950 
volcano is except for possibly this one
because<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.660> is<00:04:19.780> quite<00:04:20.200> easy<00:04:21.660> ones<00:04:22.660> not<00:04:22.780> too

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
because it is quite easy ones not too

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.700 
because it is quite easy ones not too
bad<00:04:23.850> no<00:04:24.850> God<00:04:25.030> um<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.510> personally<00:04:26.169> find<00:04:26.320> this<00:04:26.530> one

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
bad no God um I personally find this one

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.060 
bad no God um I personally find this one
quite

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
quite

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.410 
quite
difficult<00:04:27.490> but<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.670> haven't<00:04:27.820> really<00:04:28.060> i've<00:04:28.270> only

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
difficult but I haven't really i've only

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.860 
difficult but I haven't really i've only
played<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.840> once<00:04:29.020> i<00:04:29.290> think<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.000> yeah<00:04:31.000> i<00:04:31.300> don't

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
played it once i think and yeah i don't

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.150 
played it once i think and yeah i don't
know<00:04:32.020> this<00:04:32.410> one's<00:04:32.620> definitely<00:04:32.800> difficult

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
know this one's definitely difficult

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.890 
know this one's definitely difficult
though<00:04:33.490> pickaxe<00:04:34.000> probably<00:04:34.480> ate<00:04:34.540> them<00:04:34.690> out<00:04:34.840> of

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
though pickaxe probably ate them out of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.860 
though pickaxe probably ate them out of
the<00:04:35.020> way<00:04:35.170> i<00:04:36.510> don't<00:04:37.510> think<00:04:37.630> there's<00:04:37.750> really

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
the way i don't think there's really

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.170 
the way i don't think there's really
much<00:04:38.170> else<00:04:38.230> oh<00:04:38.710> there<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.460> arrow<00:04:39.640> as<00:04:40.000> i

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
much else oh there is the arrow as i

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.330 
much else oh there is the arrow as i
mentioned<00:04:40.540> this<00:04:40.720> one<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.170> never<00:04:41.770> had<00:04:42.100> one

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
mentioned this one you can never had one

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.320 
mentioned this one you can never had one
definitely<00:04:43.030> definitely<00:04:43.450> take<00:04:44.050> those<00:04:44.260> out

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
definitely definitely take those out

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.790 
definitely definitely take those out
although<00:04:46.330> i<00:04:46.360> could<00:04:46.630> probably<00:04:46.840> haven't<00:04:47.620> really

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
although i could probably haven't really

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.290 
although i could probably haven't really
tried<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.100> one<00:04:48.250> much<00:04:48.400> even<00:04:48.670> myself<00:04:48.820> but<00:04:49.270> i

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
tried that one much even myself but i

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.050 
tried that one much even myself but i
know<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.200> is<00:04:50.560> known<00:04:51.160> as<00:04:51.460> they<00:04:51.610> hard<00:04:51.850> one

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
know that it is known as they hard one

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.200 
know that it is known as they hard one
so<00:04:52.330> i'll<00:04:53.200> probably<00:04:53.410> work<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.830> out<00:04:53.980> asea<00:04:54.820> just

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
so i'll probably work that out asea just

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.170 
so i'll probably work that out asea just
those<00:04:55.360> basic<00:04:55.780> ones<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.950> yeah<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.400> really<00:04:58.000> do

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
those basic ones so yeah I really do

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.660 
those basic ones so yeah I really do
recommend<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.750> if<00:04:59.470> you<00:04:59.770> if<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.280> are<00:05:00.310> playing

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
recommend that if you if you are playing

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.240 
recommend that if you if you are playing
at<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:00.970> moment<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.480> you<00:05:01.830> haven't<00:05:02.830> been<00:05:03.070> doing

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
at the moment and you haven't been doing

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.980 
at the moment and you haven't been doing
that<00:05:03.400> then<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.120> probably<00:05:04.360> should<00:05:04.720> because

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
that then you probably should because

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.500 
that then you probably should because
the<00:05:05.380> games<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:06.100> game<00:05:06.280> mice<00:05:06.610> get<00:05:06.970> harder<00:05:07.270> again

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
the games the game mice get harder again

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.000 
the games the game mice get harder again
I<00:05:07.690> could<00:05:08.020> be<00:05:08.110> wrong<00:05:08.140> it<00:05:08.500> might<00:05:08.620> actually<00:05:08.800> get

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
I could be wrong it might actually get

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.270 
I could be wrong it might actually get
easier<00:05:09.460> again<00:05:09.760> but<00:05:10.380> but<00:05:11.380> but<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.800> finger<00:05:12.100> the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
easier again but but but the finger the

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.460 
easier again but but but the finger the
finger<00:05:12.400> needs<00:05:12.670> have<00:05:12.820> to<00:05:12.970> know<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.840> that

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
finger needs have to know that is that

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.520 
finger needs have to know that is that
um<00:05:14.620> yeah<00:05:15.220> they<00:05:15.730> ninja<00:05:16.360> kiwi<00:05:16.540> does<00:05:16.930> recognize

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
um yeah they ninja kiwi does recognize

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.410 
um yeah they ninja kiwi does recognize
that<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.890> lot<00:05:18.070> of<00:05:18.100> people<00:05:18.190> dislike<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.270> the

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
that a lot of people dislike that the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.020 
that a lot of people dislike that the
rounds<00:05:19.780> taking<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.140> lot<00:05:20.290> longer<00:05:20.320> now<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:21.670> they

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
rounds taking a lot longer now so they

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.090 
rounds taking a lot longer now so they
want<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.450> fix<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.900> they're<00:05:23.440> i'm<00:05:23.740> pretty<00:05:23.860> sure

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
want to fix that they're i'm pretty sure

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.970 
want to fix that they're i'm pretty sure
they're<00:05:24.250> going<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.730> fix<00:05:25.030> that<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.590> one<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.620> the

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
they're going to fix that and one of the
