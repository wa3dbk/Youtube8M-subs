chance to sit back and take a look at

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.460 
chance to sit back and take a look at
teams<00:00:27.269> before<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.930> there<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> take

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
teams before you get out there to take

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.019 
teams before you get out there to take
them<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.970> view

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
them on or do you actually do you view

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630 
them on or do you actually do you view
anything<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.660> watch<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.050> games<00:00:31.309> not<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> lots

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
anything to watch the games not a lots

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
anything to watch the games not a lots
too<00:00:32.850> i<00:00:32.910> think<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.690> happens<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> most<00:00:34.530> of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
too i think what what happens is most of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.170 
too i think what what happens is most of
these<00:00:34.770> teams<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> tour<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
these teams we see them on the tour and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.270 
these teams we see them on the tour and
we<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.600> well<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> i<00:00:38.160> think

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
we know them really well and i think

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.799 
we know them really well and i think
we're<00:00:38.610> more<00:00:38.790> concerned<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.690> ice

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
we're more concerned about the ice

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
we're more concerned about the ice
conditions<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> rocks<00:00:40.920> than<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.460> are

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
to keep our focus and I really believe

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.339 
to keep our focus and I really believe
that<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.360> want<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.720> keep<00:02:24.930> our<00:02:25.110> numbers

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
that we want to keep our numbers

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.130 
that we want to keep our numbers
consistent<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.450> start<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.050> know

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
consistent because if we start you know

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.839 
consistent because if we start you know
putting<00:02:28.380> labels<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.920> teams<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.489> we<00:02:29.520> start

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
putting labels on teams and we start

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.610 
putting labels on teams and we start
putting<00:02:30.000> importance<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.780> games<00:02:31.020> more<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.470> than

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
putting importance on games more so than

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.140 
putting importance on games more so than
the<00:02:31.770> others<00:02:32.010> i<00:02:32.100> think<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.370> lose<00:02:32.550> our<00:02:32.670> focus<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the others i think we lose our focus the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.630 
the others i think we lose our focus the
focus<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.569> on<00:02:33.720> making<00:02:34.080> shots<00:02:34.520> regardless<00:02:35.520> of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
focus is on making shots regardless of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.250 
focus is on making shots regardless of
score<00:02:35.940> regardless<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> game<00:02:36.959> regardless

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
score regardless of the game regardless

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.290 
score regardless of the game regardless
of<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.800> end<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.520> if<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.700> sit<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> hack

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
