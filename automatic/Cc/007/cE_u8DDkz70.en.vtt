whenever you kill pigs these ghost big
spawns<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.540> kill<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900

called ghost pork chops yes haha and you
can<00:02:33.970> actually<00:02:34.210> craft<00:02:34.510> these<00:02:34.690> ghost<00:02:34.990> pork

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260

chops<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.710> different<00:02:35.980> way<00:02:36.070> as<00:02:36.190> well<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
chops in a different way as well so you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.400 
chops in a different way as well so you
realize<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.780> actually<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.110> ghost

effective weapon is definitely worth

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.170 
effective weapon is definitely worth
making<00:05:37.990> this<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:38.710> it's<00:05:38.830> durability<00:05:39.190> is<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.909> bit

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
making this and it's durability is a bit

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.939 
making this and it's durability is a bit
better<00:05:40.360> than<00:05:40.509> diamond<00:05:40.960> as<00:05:41.110> well<00:05:41.349> so

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
better than diamond as well so

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.290 
better than diamond as well so
definitely<00:05:42.279> worth<00:05:42.400> crafting<00:05:42.909> this<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.210> it

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
definitely worth crafting this and it

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.059 
definitely worth crafting this and it
goes<00:05:43.449> well<00:05:43.719> with<00:05:43.779> iron<00:05:44.259> armor<00:05:44.560> in<00:05:44.710> fact<00:05:44.979> it

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
goes well with iron armor in fact it

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.129 
goes well with iron armor in fact it
really<00:05:45.159> does<00:05:45.460> blend<00:05:45.729> in<00:05:45.940> well<00:05:46.120> but<00:05:46.810> next<00:05:46.960> that

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
really does blend in well but next that

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.540 
really does blend in well but next that
we've<00:05:47.229> got<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.590> ghost<00:05:47.830> pickaxe<00:05:48.219> which<00:05:48.430> is

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
we've got the ghost pickaxe which is

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.309 
we've got the ghost pickaxe which is
actually<00:05:48.819> crafted<00:05:49.210> in<00:05:49.330> an<00:05:49.539> identical<00:05:50.020> manner

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
actually crafted in an identical manner

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.140 
actually crafted in an identical manner
to<00:05:50.529> a<00:05:50.560> normal<00:05:50.949> pickaxe<00:05:51.340> so<00:05:51.610> all<00:05:51.819> you<00:05:51.909> need<00:05:52.029> to

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
to a normal pickaxe so all you need to

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.300 
to a normal pickaxe so all you need to
do<00:05:52.270> is<00:05:52.479> just<00:05:52.779> put<00:05:52.960> three<00:05:53.139> ghost<00:05:53.740> ingots<00:05:54.099> and

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
do is just put three ghost ingots and

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.670 
do is just put three ghost ingots and
then<00:05:54.699> two<00:05:54.880> sticks<00:05:55.150> like<00:05:55.419> so<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.900> it<00:05:56.110> comes<00:05:56.380> pre

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
then two sticks like so and it comes pre

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.890 
then two sticks like so and it comes pre
intented<00:05:57.130> with<00:05:57.310> silk<00:05:57.610> touch<00:05:57.759> one<00:05:58.090> so<00:05:58.599> normally

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
intented with silk touch one so normally

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.510 
intented with silk touch one so normally
in<00:05:58.990> Minecraft<00:05:59.380> if<00:05:59.560> you<00:05:59.680> wanted<00:05:59.949> to<00:06:00.099> get<00:06:00.219> silk

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
in Minecraft if you wanted to get silk

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.950 
in Minecraft if you wanted to get silk
touch<00:06:00.639> one<00:06:00.909> you'd<00:06:01.300> have<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.509> enchant<00:06:01.870> a

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
touch one you'd have to enchant a

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.600 
touch one you'd have to enchant a
pickaxe<00:06:02.259> so<00:06:02.469> many<00:06:02.680> times<00:06:02.949> to<00:06:03.190> try<00:06:03.340> and<00:06:03.460> get

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
pickaxe so many times to try and get

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.670 
pickaxe so many times to try and get
lucky<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.090> get<00:06:04.509> silk<00:06:04.750> touch<00:06:04.870> one<00:06:05.169> but<00:06:05.529> now<00:06:05.620> you

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
lucky and get silk touch one but now you

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.110 
lucky and get silk touch one but now you
can<00:06:05.860> just<00:06:05.949> craft<00:06:06.250> a<00:06:06.340> ghost<00:06:06.520> pickaxe<00:06:06.849> and<00:06:07.000> it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
can just craft a ghost pickaxe and it

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.149 
can just craft a ghost pickaxe and it
comes<00:06:07.300> automatically<00:06:07.870> with<00:06:08.199> silk<00:06:08.590> touch<00:06:08.800> one

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
comes automatically with silk touch one

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.830 
comes automatically with silk touch one
so<00:06:09.669> let's<00:06:09.789> just<00:06:09.969> test<00:06:10.120> it<00:06:10.300> out<00:06:10.389> over<00:06:10.659> here<00:06:10.779> on

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
so let's just test it out over here on

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.899 
so let's just test it out over here on
these<00:06:11.110> diamond<00:06:11.469> doors<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.009> you<00:06:12.219> can<00:06:12.370> see<00:06:12.550> that

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
these diamond doors and you can see that

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.309 
these diamond doors and you can see that
I've<00:06:13.060> now<00:06:13.090> got<00:06:13.449> diamond<00:06:13.840> door<00:06:14.020> blocks

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
I've now got diamond door blocks

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.959 
I've now got diamond door blocks
directly<00:06:14.590> and<00:06:15.009> I<00:06:15.039> haven't<00:06:15.250> got<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.490> diamonds

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
directly and I haven't got the diamonds

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.089 
directly and I haven't got the diamonds
just<00:06:16.419> showing<00:06:16.690> that<00:06:16.810> it<00:06:16.900> does<00:06:17.080> work<00:06:17.349> and<00:06:17.620> of

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
just showing that it does work and of

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.339 
just showing that it does work and of
course<00:06:18.130> you<00:06:18.430> can<00:06:18.580> also<00:06:18.759> craft<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.509> ghost<00:06:20.050> axe

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
course you can also craft the ghost axe

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.100 
course you can also craft the ghost axe
the<00:06:20.889> ghost<00:06:21.279> shovel<00:06:21.669> and<00:06:21.789> the<00:06:22.330> ghost<00:06:22.630> hoe<00:06:22.870> and

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
the ghost shovel and the ghost hoe and

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.809 
the ghost shovel and the ghost hoe and
take<00:06:23.440> note<00:06:23.650> look<00:06:23.889> at<00:06:23.979> the<00:06:24.039> attack<00:06:24.340> damage<00:06:24.550> on

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
take note look at the attack damage on

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.129 
take note look at the attack damage on
these<00:06:24.909> things<00:06:25.210> I<00:06:25.330> mean<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.630> ghost<00:06:25.810> hoe<00:06:26.080> does

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
these things I mean the ghost hoe does

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.360 
these things I mean the ghost hoe does
eight<00:06:26.500> attack<00:06:26.889> damage

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
eight attack damage

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.760 
eight attack damage
there<00:06:27.699> you<00:06:27.759> go<00:06:27.880> shovel<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.360> six<00:06:28.659> and<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.529> ghost

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
there you go shovel to six and the ghost

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.040 
there you go shovel to six and the ghost
axe<00:06:30.039> does<00:06:30.250> eight<00:06:30.460> as<00:06:30.729> well<00:06:30.969> and<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.659> ghost

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
axe does eight as well and a ghost

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.529 
axe does eight as well and a ghost
pickaxe<00:06:32.500> does<00:06:32.770> seven<00:06:33.130> damage<00:06:33.430> so<00:06:34.150> that<00:06:34.300> shows

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
pickaxe does seven damage so that shows

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:35.909 
pickaxe does seven damage so that shows
that<00:06:34.659> all<00:06:34.810> of<00:06:34.839> these<00:06:35.080> are<00:06:35.139> really<00:06:35.440> effective

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
that all of these are really effective

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.709 
that all of these are really effective
weapons<00:06:36.250> and<00:06:36.430> pretty<00:06:36.820> much<00:06:36.940> on<00:06:37.120> par<00:06:37.479> with<00:06:37.509> a

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:37.719 
weapons and pretty much on par with a

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.180 
weapons and pretty much on par with a
diamond<00:06:38.139> sword<00:06:38.409> so<00:06:38.589> you<00:06:38.680> could<00:06:38.770> use<00:06:38.889> any<00:06:39.099> of

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
diamond sword so you could use any of

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.740 
diamond sword so you could use any of
these<00:06:39.339> as<00:06:39.580> an<00:06:39.789> effective<00:06:40.149> weapon

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
these as an effective weapon

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.510 
these as an effective weapon
but<00:06:41.230> the<00:06:41.320> ghost<00:06:41.530> hoe<00:06:41.740> is<00:06:41.890> another<00:06:42.130> special

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
but the ghost hoe is another special

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.010 
but the ghost hoe is another special
ability<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.150> actually<00:06:43.300> has<00:06:43.570> been<00:06:43.750> breaking

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
ability it actually has been breaking

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.330 
ability it actually has been breaking
even<00:06:44.410> though<00:06:44.590> it<00:06:44.680> doesn't<00:06:44.920> show<00:06:45.100> it<00:06:45.220> at<00:06:45.310> the

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
even though it doesn't show it at the

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.580 
even though it doesn't show it at the
moment<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:46.330> unbreaking<00:06:46.960> effect<00:06:47.290> just

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
moment and the unbreaking effect just

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.380 
moment and the unbreaking effect just
means<00:06:47.920> it's<00:06:48.250> never<00:06:48.550> gonna<00:06:48.760> run<00:06:48.850> out<00:06:49.060> so<00:06:49.240> it's

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
means it's never gonna run out so it's

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.630 
means it's never gonna run out so it's
just<00:06:49.480> a<00:06:49.630> permanent<00:06:50.140> ghost<00:06:50.950> oh<00:06:51.190> pretty<00:06:51.490> much

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
just a permanent ghost oh pretty much

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.950 
just a permanent ghost oh pretty much
but<00:06:51.880> then<00:06:52.000> again<00:06:52.090> why<00:06:52.390> would<00:06:52.540> you<00:06:52.660> ever<00:06:52.810> want

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
but then again why would you ever want

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.870 
but then again why would you ever want
to<00:06:53.170> use<00:06:53.230> that<00:06:53.500> hoe<00:06:53.710> so<00:06:53.980> much<00:06:54.160> there's<00:06:54.700> no

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
to use that hoe so much there's no

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.520 
to use that hoe so much there's no
reason<00:06:55.330> to<00:06:55.360> use<00:06:55.600> a<00:06:55.630> hoe<00:06:55.810> that<00:06:56.080> much<00:06:56.290> unless

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530 
reason to use a hoe that much unless

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.260 
reason to use a hoe that much unless
you're<00:06:56.740> doing<00:06:56.950> some<00:06:57.070> extreme<00:06:57.460> farming<00:06:58.060> I

you're doing some extreme farming I
don't<00:06:58.690> even<00:06:58.750> know<00:06:59.050> but<00:06:59.440> yeah<00:06:59.560> so<00:06:59.710> that's<00:06:59.830> the

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.040 
don't even know but yeah so that's the

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.770 
don't even know but yeah so that's the
tools<00:07:00.370> at<00:07:00.580> this<00:07:00.700> mod<00:07:00.880> adds<00:07:01.060> but<00:07:01.510> yeah<00:07:01.600> that

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
tools at this mod adds but yeah that

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.330 
tools at this mod adds but yeah that
pretty<00:07:01.870> much<00:07:01.990> sums<00:07:02.110> up<00:07:02.350> all<00:07:02.500> the<00:07:02.800> items<00:07:03.220> in

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
pretty much sums up all the items in

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.950 
pretty much sums up all the items in
this<00:07:03.430> Mon<00:07:03.670> let's<00:07:03.880> just<00:07:04.060> test<00:07:04.270> out<00:07:04.420> this<00:07:04.930> a

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
this Mon let's just test out this a

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.810 
this Mon let's just test out this a
ghost<00:07:05.380> sword<00:07:05.650> on<00:07:05.860> this<00:07:06.010> iron<00:07:06.190> golem<00:07:06.550> so<00:07:06.730> you

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
ghost sword on this iron golem so you

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.860 
ghost sword on this iron golem so you
can<00:07:06.910> see<00:07:06.970> it<00:07:07.060> does<00:07:07.180> ten<00:07:07.390> damage<00:07:07.690> per<00:07:07.840> hit

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
can see it does ten damage per hit

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.420 
can see it does ten damage per hit
because<00:07:08.440> we've<00:07:08.620> got<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.830> nine<00:07:09.010> damage<00:07:09.310> from

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
because we've got the nine damage from

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.070 
because we've got the nine damage from
the<00:07:09.550> sword<00:07:09.730> itself<00:07:10.000> and<00:07:10.300> then<00:07:10.540> the<00:07:10.660> one<00:07:10.840> from

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
the sword itself and then the one from

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.470 
the sword itself and then the one from
punching<00:07:11.440> damage<00:07:11.710> and<00:07:11.920> if<00:07:12.490> I<00:07:12.640> do<00:07:12.700> criticals<00:07:13.330> it

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
punching damage and if I do criticals it

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.540 
punching damage and if I do criticals it
does<00:07:13.630> fifteen<00:07:14.050> damage<00:07:14.440> and<00:07:14.680> now<00:07:15.190> we've<00:07:15.370> just

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
does fifteen damage and now we've just

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.130 
does fifteen damage and now we've just
killed<00:07:15.669> that<00:07:15.820> iron<00:07:16.000> golem<00:07:16.330> in<00:07:16.480> about<00:07:16.840> nine

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140 
killed that iron golem in about nine

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.620 
killed that iron golem in about nine
hits<00:07:17.410> how<00:07:17.650> awesome<00:07:18.190> was<00:07:18.310> that<00:07:18.370> so<00:07:19.060> yeah<00:07:19.210> as<00:07:19.419> I

hits how awesome was that so yeah as I
was<00:07:19.660> saying<00:07:19.780> that<00:07:20.260> pretty<00:07:20.440> much<00:07:20.530> sums<00:07:20.740> up

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
was saying that pretty much sums up

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.710 
was saying that pretty much sums up
everything<00:07:21.010> in<00:07:21.520> this<00:07:21.669> mod<00:07:21.940> it<00:07:22.270> just<00:07:22.480> has<00:07:22.600> an

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
everything in this mod it just has an

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.600 
everything in this mod it just has an
array<00:07:22.900> of<00:07:22.930> cool<00:07:23.260> items<00:07:23.680> as<00:07:23.860> well<00:07:24.010> as<00:07:24.070> new<00:07:24.310> mobs

array of cool items as well as new mobs

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.430 
array of cool items as well as new mobs
and<00:07:24.880> it's<00:07:25.300> really<00:07:25.540> cool<00:07:25.720> to<00:07:25.840> have<00:07:25.900> ghosts<00:07:26.380> in

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
and it's really cool to have ghosts in

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.110 
and it's really cool to have ghosts in
Minecraft<00:07:27.010> and<00:07:27.220> I<00:07:27.490> love<00:07:27.640> the<00:07:27.790> fact<00:07:27.940> that<00:07:27.970> it

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
Minecraft and I love the fact that it

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.520 
Minecraft and I love the fact that it
adds<00:07:28.240> an<00:07:28.390> extra<00:07:28.480> challenge<00:07:29.020> when<00:07:29.200> you<00:07:29.290> die

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
adds an extra challenge when you die

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.980 
adds an extra challenge when you die
because<00:07:29.950> when<00:07:30.190> you<00:07:30.310> die<00:07:30.520> your<00:07:30.880> own<00:07:31.030> like<00:07:31.690> self

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:31.990 
because when you die your own like self

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.870 
because when you die your own like self
spawns<00:07:32.410> as<00:07:32.590> a<00:07:32.620> ghost<00:07:32.950> and<00:07:33.190> then<00:07:33.490> when<00:07:33.610> you<00:07:33.700> come

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
spawns as a ghost and then when you come

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.220 
spawns as a ghost and then when you come
back<00:07:34.000> to<00:07:34.150> try<00:07:34.330> and<00:07:34.450> collect<00:07:34.630> your<00:07:34.780> items<00:07:35.110> you
