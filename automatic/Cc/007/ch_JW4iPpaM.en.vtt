00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.870
 today we are going to make cocoa butter and 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.260
 hazelnuts and we will need these 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.410
 Ingredients 200 grams of hazelnuts 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.349
 Toasted and peeled 50 grams of cocoa 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.040
 pure powder defatted 200 grams of 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.860
 white or brown sugar 150 milliliters of 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.930
 warm whole milk 50 milliliters of 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.300
 sunflower oil a spoonful of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.300
 Vanilla essence and a pinch of salt 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.710
 The first thing we are going to do is throw out 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.690
 all the hazelnuts inside one 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.840
 mincer or other food processor 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.149
 that we have the ideal is to do it in a 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.930
 chopper of this type we close and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.930
 we started to shred 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.230
 if as we explain it we see that 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.400
 the dust of the hazelnuts stays 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.440
 stuck to the walls 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.490
 we open if we take it off so that it 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.490
 fall back to the bottom 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.300
 we keep grinding until we get a 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.010
 kind of oily paste if you see that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.470
 there are still pieces you can follow 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.270
 beating though these pieces do not remain 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.880
 completely wrong 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.820
 then we add the brown sugar 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 in this case we have used the tan 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.240
 but you can also take the white 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.350
 pour the sunflower oil we add 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.350
 cocoa powder 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.810
 and we put a pinch of salt 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.480
 a spoonful of vanilla 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.600
 and finally the milk that has to 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.420
 be hot 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 and we continue beating us in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.000
 In the beginning we take 50 ml of milk but 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 As it was very thick we were adding 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.729
 more to leave it with the thickness that more 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.420
 we liked it in the end we took a total of 150 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.070
 milliliters and we were pretty good 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.899
 after a while beating we have 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.330
 finished our cocoa cream and 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.390
 hazelnuts that has left us with a 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.340
 color of a pretty appetizing shine 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 although now it is seen that it is somewhat liquid 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.929
 once it cools it will take more thickness the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.890
 we keep in some glass jars with 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.610
 hermetic seal 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.650
 and we put them in the fridge a few hours 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.840
 when it has cooled down we can see how 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.240
 our cream has already caught something more than 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.209
 consistency and we can already use it 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.420
 for what we want for the snack 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.910
 for breakfast or to prepare desserts 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 for our taste it is much richer 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.050
 than the commercial one and also made by 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.730
 ourselves is much more knows 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.470
 nutritious 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.510
 we hope that you also should do 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.720
 at home and leave us your 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.430
 comments see you in the next 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.430
 video until next time
