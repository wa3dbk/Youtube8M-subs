00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.119
 but the challenge now is to kill more than 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.890
 60 in a harpoon domination game 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 cartolandia whatever it is only 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.260
 I needed to kill more than 60 a game 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.600
 this did not matter what weapon he brought 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.089
 he killed him with cues tricks scores and how 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.820
 they fight as I would like to kill them 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.250
 four campeando by everything only 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.140
 want to kill more than 60 also a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 person put that he had to kill more if 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 is in a game I do not go 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.510
 that gave me those challenges but if you are 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 one of those who position in a challenge of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.969
 kill more than 50 or more than 60 in some 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.769
 east game of maine that in which video 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 You put your challenge on what video I put on your 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.539
 comment because not everyone can give them 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.190
 the credit since sometimes he does not find 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.950
 the challenges because if they are a bit of 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.130
 minimal challenges I get 10 per video and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.660
 I have 300 pins and some videos of what if 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 this bastard find all the challenges 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.500
 I only remember what emotion this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.300
 challenge remember is to say that this tour 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 who put this challenge tell me in which video what 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.800
 you put to be able to give yourself credit and then 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 this one good they put me another one is correct 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.820
 from pedro gonzÃ¡lez 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.460
 of 14 hours ago this also another 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.290
 person commented saying that you want to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.270
 beginning the straight video that says this 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 challenge to say slow what it says to the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.130
 beginning of a video this well I do not know 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 why do not they understand it but I when 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 I hear myself in the videos and I understand 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 the best because I know what was 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 saying or because he managed to identify what 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 I say I do not know what the fuck but this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.600
 what I say at the beginning of the videos 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.170
 is that it happened gamers here auto it went another 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.170
 time with one more challenge or a new video more 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.880
 more than black ops I tell you so but 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 several do not know if they do not understand this one says 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619
 nothing love me once I remember that it does 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.870
 about 20 videos or about 30 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.549
 videos I put a guy not mames ya ni 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.830
 You can not even tell from the 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.200
 principle is locked does not know or say 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
 we take who stays more than anyone else 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.160
 I was making fun because - I did not know 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.630
 say the beginning of the video but it's 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.459
 that he is not that he does not know that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.590
 the best thing I say fast that they do not reach 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.709
 to know what I'm saying but that's what 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.700
 I say it happened game here auto went another 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.510
 once with 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.670
 a new video more if I tell you but not 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.890
 I know why but as good is talking 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.500
 of the challenges of this are two challenges in 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.090
 one the challenge of yesterday was a decision of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.099
 swarm in all against all 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.220
 is in first place in all against 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.069
 all with some emissions and take out the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.810
 medal of 15 with the check-in that was a 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.330
 challenge of yesterday in the video of am 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.670
 they were two videos two challenges were very 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.980
 because this short but this is a challenge 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.220
 What if I could do it? 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.250
 from before but only then sometimes 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.650
 I do not choose them, but suddenly 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.650
 you do not have me I do not plan the day 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.260
 be as you say the challenge I will do 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.660
 this challenge to this I only think 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.640
 in a challenge the only thing that I plan is and 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.680
 I'm going to upload a normal gameplay I'm going to 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.530
 upload a challenge a tip a tutorial what 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.450
 that I have not done is that I've only 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.160
 been climbing pure challenge their challenge since 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.650
 I had a video that if they are going to scream 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.989
 lead them to be angry with all of this challenge 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.000
 day said they did not matter that no 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.370
 gets angry 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.100
 I was also commenting that it is watering 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.100
 in which they tell me that I already mentioned spitz 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.960
 5 ideas and it's still not my challenge or so I 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.030
 they say that just as they do not 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.640
 rest several people is not just one 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.680
 person this is like five people the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.140
 I have seen are if it is the best 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.030
 be more but I have only seen how 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.160
 five people who say water and why 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.570
 you do not do direct or who knows what 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.040
 this attempt to do all the challenges 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.410
 I still know that sometimes I do challenges and 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.200
 undertake easy work or 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.110
 shorts like this hunter's video this 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.850
 one with a collateral with a bullet 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.370
 sniper that is a very challenging 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.470
 easy and very short since only in 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.780
 some lucky game that two ways 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.610
 will accommodate while I shot a 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.190
 bullet and you kill them both and it will be a 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.870
 Lucky video a lucky challenge because 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 I will never accommodate the enemies 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.580
 to be able to shoot and kill them both 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.380
 of a bullet since they are luck challenges or 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.050
 very short challenges truth this they are 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.690
 how best they are simple because sometimes 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.610
 that there exist those blowjobs come out 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.040
 There are also several people who comment 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.200
 only to leave the videos as I 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.970
 They have to take click 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.370
 that was undaunted weapons now now 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.990
 they only say without a silencer to 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.990
 that they think it's a little more video 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.240
 but taking out jovi is very easy 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.820
 this is not the level at which they are 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.220
 those people but only do this 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.170
 mother to download the video to the best 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.660
 if you are seeing it was because if I put it in 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.580
 a comment the video so they know 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.800
 who put it as to give a greeting 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.930
 whatever, but this is what I say 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.720
 is that also do not put the challenge are 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.090
 as well as so minds because all the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.890
 people comment obviously comment 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.230
 because they want to watch a video about their 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.240
 challenge this tried to do all the challenges 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.760
 that can obviously I will not be able to 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.780
 every challenge every video that they pose 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.060
 10 more challenges since I'm going to draw 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.640
 999 each video that goes up or stays 9 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.490
 challenges without doing and one I do that is that 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.440
 one in ten of something like that but 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.540
 there are times that in some days with more 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.580
 of ten challenges sometimes that no more for in 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.010
 five but now I've looked at what we've 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.410
 I was almost reaching the hundred likes almost 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.410
 always and they already lack a little bit of 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.809
 several videos that have like 115 120 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.179
 likes and current 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:06:00.659
 remember I say 150 likes and I do 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:03.479
 brightcove 270 livestream does not matter 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:05.999
 if it's zombies or whatever you are going 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.249
 to decide is recording tell me if 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.079
 they want this that subaru teaching me 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.329
 face because I was just thinking 

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:13.889
 be a burden without showing my face no more 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.749
 on one hand and as well as on how much 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.519
 accredita they will be watching but live 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.039
 only one part live with 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.899
 subscribers but this one I think they're 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.969
 will like it more I show my face or is 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:26.039
 wishing my face I believe this also you 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.599
 I have in mind to do the series the road 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.299
 to gold I'm going to do it with the remington 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.189
 although several people proposed that I 

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:35.069
 they put that with the street that they put me with 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:38.159
 with several different weapons they put us 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.959
 with a shit but for this one the 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.579
 remington of the guide decided to 

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:44.759
 I think tomorrow or the day after tomorrow I will 

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:47.369
 start those series this to this challenge 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.860
 from here it's a little long but as they 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:53.309
 I say I challenge I do not obviously do the 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.379
 challenges like one minute as well as here 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:57.360
 each previous video as they say this 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.820
 recommendation five minutes ago is from 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.190
 five hours or whatever I do 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.470
 that are coming out like this game or 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.390
 this challenge was only playing 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.400
 it suddenly came out I remembered a person 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.080
 who put such a challenge and once you 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.640
 I added the challenge of that person who 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.070
 I wanted to hear what he said to 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.350
 beginning the video but in slow either 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.330
 that people who did not understand what 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.270
 I said at the beginning of the videos that's what 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.240
 what I say remember in this 50 the exists 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.490
 we are already arriving this only has 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.040
 spend a week a week 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.510
 to be public this video since it is the 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.190
 they are but they will be on Fridays 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.020

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.030
 little that I do want to be in the 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.030
