00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.960
These are the top-selling music artists of
all-time.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.470
If Robyn Rihanna Fenty’s early success continues,
the 26-year-old superstar from Barbados will

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.490
probably one day be #1 on this list.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.499
She has already tied Michael Jackson for third
all-time with 13 #1 singles.

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:23.810
She also reigns over the Internet and is the
most streamed and subscribed artist in the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
world.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.099
Her home country even celebrates an official
national holiday in her honor every February

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189
22nd.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.440
Eagles have come a long way from their first
performance at Disneyland backing Linda Ronstadt.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.920
After coming up with their name during a tequila
and peyote fueled trip in the Mojave Desert,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.809
the band decided they should simply be called
Eagles.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.499
They had five #1 singles and four #1 albums
in a row in the 70’s.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.309
Eagles are the best-selling American band
ever.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.409
The massively influential Mariah Carey broke
through in 1988.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.150
Mariah was introduced to classical opera as
a teenager, which clearly influenced her unique

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.170
singing style.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.490
Her voice was so fresh that her first four
singles from her debut album all went to number

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.070
one on the charts, the first artist since
The Jackson 5 to achieve that level of lightening-fast

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.810
success.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.970
Led Zeppelin was the biggest and most innovative
band in the world in the 1970’s.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.649
The track “Stairway to Heaven” may be
the most important song in rock history.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.600
After the tragic death of their drummer, John
Bonham, the band broke up.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.539
Their 2007 reunion concert at London’s O2
Arena set the record for Highest Demand for

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.460
Tickets for One Music Concert.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.290
Garth Brooks brilliantly fused elements of
rock with country, producing hit after hit,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.920
and revolutionizing the entire genre.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.350
He is the best-selling albums artist in the
United States in the SoundScan era, the time

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.020
period after 1991 when sales figures began
to me more accurately counted.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.430
Brooks has six albums that have sold more
than 10 million copies.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.810
Elton John was a prodigy on the piano since
his fingers first touched the keys as a three

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.920
year old, able to playback classical pieces
that he had heard just once.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.820
Within just a three-year span, between 1972
and 1975, he had seven consecutive albums

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.140
reach number one in the US.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.460
His single honoring the life of British Princess
Diana after her death is the best-selling

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.430
single in music history.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.630
Madonna Louise Cissone is the “Queen of
Pop” and is the best-selling female artist

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.940
of all-time.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.040
It all started when she dropped out of the
University of Michigan to pursue a career

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040
in dance.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.130
“It was the first time I’d ever taken
a plane, the first time I’d ever gotten

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.920
a taxi cab,” she remembers.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.550
“I came here with $35 in my pocket.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.400
It was the bravest thing I’ve ever done.”

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.920
Michael Jackson, the “King of Pop,” spent
virtually his entire life on top of the charts,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.000
and in the glaring spotlight.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.170
After churning out hit after hit with his
brothers, he began his prolific solo career

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.700
at 13 years old.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.530
His masterpiece, Thriller, is the best-selling
album of all-time.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.230
Jackson’s legendary moonwalk performance
of “Billie Jean” in 1983 to a live television

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.340
audience of 47 million Americans launched
his fame into the stratosphere.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.450
Then there’s Elvis, or simply, “The King.”

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.120
His leg shake was a result of his nerves,
but soon became his signature move, driving

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.840
crowds crazy.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.410
Elvis was unlike anything anyone had seen
or heard before, and his blend of Motown and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.180
southern sounds arrived right as the civil
rights movement was taking off.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.830
At age 23, right when his career was peaking,
Presley was drafted into the US Army and served

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.920
for two years in Germany.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.000
While there, he became severely dependent
on drugs, which eventually ruined his body

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.480
and career, and took his life when he was
just 42.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.040
The Beatles are the most successful band in
human history.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.380
They’ve sold more albums than any other
act and have the most #1 hits on the US Billboard

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.370
Chart, with 20 over just a 7 year period.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.189
On February 9th, 1964, the Beatles appeared
in front of a live audience of 73 million

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:34.280
Americans on The Ed Sullivan Show, launching
the British Invasion of the pop music charts

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.250
that continues to this day.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.949
I hope you enjoyed this musical mini-doc.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.550
Which artist’s music do you think people
should be buying more of?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.910
Thanks for watching.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.629
For TDC, I’m Bryce Plank.
