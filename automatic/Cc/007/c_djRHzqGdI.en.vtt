I<00:04:03.430> think<00:04:03.819> is<00:04:03.940> surprising<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.510> him<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.900> asked<00:04:05.170> him

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
I think is surprising to him I asked him

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.039 
I think is surprising to him I asked him
about<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.890> last<00:04:06.099> year<00:04:06.519> after<00:04:06.910> he<00:04:07.299> won<00:04:07.510> his

strong a broker of course is because he

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:23.950
