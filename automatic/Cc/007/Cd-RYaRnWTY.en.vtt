00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.440
 Welcome to the engine block and 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.330
 if I'm in shock here 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.269
 I am at an incredible price 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.519
 number of free living cook in one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 Japanese garden would like the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.250
 possibility to use also for 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 to lose driver's seat and indeed 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.689
 talk to us for a short time 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 the topic cloudy water because if I 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.510
 one of the most common non beordern 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.019
 if I have one but one of them 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.260
 my view most often observed 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 misinterpretation what the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
 Water quality is concerned when the people 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.460
 say my god my water is not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.050
 clear 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.690
 But it does not have to be that either 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.539
 that cloud is so good 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.829
 correct as well as wrong right is that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.600
 the carp through its half under 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 continuous walls and he does not have a complete 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.809
 under constant times such as 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.879
 but disturb by his half under 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.989
 continuous walls with him in free in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 the outdoors in nature 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.149
 if he is in ten liebherr one and the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 Bodengrund re-dug with it made for it 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.409
 that the pond turns in relatively short 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.489
 time clouds and this cloudy provides 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.340
 for being with his normal 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.189
 muddy color that he made for 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.030
 enemies becomes invisible so that's it 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.020
 a part of his survival strategy and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.400
 she is also pretty good 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.900
 perfected because we always 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.700
 has tried can in garden pond 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.229
 Keep bidding substrates is alone 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.759
 a few very large tubs 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 who knows how fast it's more so 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.780
 a pond becomes and against such a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 Examination is nothing at all 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.920
 to object if we here the times 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 fight the dough from the shock inputs are 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.549
 then we have some tons here 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 fish in there I am sure 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.680
 but he is counting on the size of about 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 20,000 square meters which is on the one hand 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.399
 nothing and on the other hand it is one 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.990
 extensive fish attitude that's what she means 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.149
 run no pumps run here no 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.159
 ventilation here are the crows to be 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.020
 made and except for a few grams of bread 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.340
 they have to take care of it every day 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 feed themselves 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.110
 that means it is not permanent much 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.719
 to raw materials as portable ensures 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.610
 that the pond is overfertilized the pond 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.860
 generates itself and that also means 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.710
 the bottom is relatively poor in nutrients 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.330
 So if the koi pond open 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.610
 then it is not that there in the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.750
 very organic nutrients organic 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.520
 but not in a multi-level water 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.530
 unnecessarily chase the no upward pressure 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.569
 but it would just be one 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.740
 muddy threat with the fish right 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.490
 That's how it can be done well 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.440
 in the flood 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.540
 So if it's through the river and that 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.250
 water totally brown then it is not 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.870
 so it's all fishing is then 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 that any are in heirs 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.050
 the other segments on it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.790
 to be replenished and refilled 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.440
 but they are carried away by the river 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.660
 fish handle it quite well 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.160
 It is different in turbidity in the pond in the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.430
 kreuther I know only two 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.870
 Real turbulences if you look at the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.310
 problem of the simple one you have to 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.560
 can lead to a milky cloudiness 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.820
 of certain period starting it we know 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.950
 two cloudiness one is the one 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.069
 algae bloom is very common as well 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.440
 very often inadequate to ours 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.610
 a working mechanical filter 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.350
 and the latter means nothing 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.300
 other that the crew in their own 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 shit nice and shit is everything 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.900
 other than nutrient-poor code is 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.950
 nutrienty sorry that me 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.630
 shit said stay reason is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.569
 nutrient-rich and whirled up 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.870
 code sometime so the dough so 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.940
 impressive mineral but 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.980
 low-nutrient in nutrient-poor soil 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.530
 segment will only make sure in the end 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.780
 that he has no pressure in the pond vertical 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.790
 On the one hand, that goes up 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.320
 biological filtration very much 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.010
 works worse because the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.450
 Bacteria we code 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.850
 for example, build 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.049
 they are much faster in theirs 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.760
 colonies education and very much 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.680
 more adaptable than the profi knew 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.600
 So this anonymous letter will take care of 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.579
 part of the now such an accustomed 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.280
 agitated co-haze has not only 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.630
 much higher no pressure but has 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.040
 also a much worse one 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.109
 functioning biological degradation 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.060
 performance which I often really in 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.280
 permanently high low 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.320
 noticeable so we were again 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.079
 together we know three over there 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.820
 in total and one is the fill 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.070
 a nutrient-poor ground segment the 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.870
 others are the old bloody frequent ones 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.480
 herbs occurs and the third one is 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.670
 actually inadequate mechanical 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.859
 filter the first and the second one of 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.320
 Croy easily accepted everything 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.400
 Green can even be positive here 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.599
 we mix it up, I'll go right away 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.909
 with the camera on it we have one 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.080
 Mixture after a light algae bloom 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.600
 It's not as strong as it is in the world 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.970
 moment looks like 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.070
 the revived regiment and then 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.630
 we still have the code and the coach 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.670
 does not work so they should never 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.830
 The apology bring the yes 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.990
 Colleagues in nature if it is not 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.580
 the algal bloom is and still pushes 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.990
 then we have to watch theirs 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.670
 find mechanical one or the other 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.670
 be making optimize other wise 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.440
 Come find the paper 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.420
 Watching them, the more time the water 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.910
 let feel that means no less 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.040
 environmental performance but larger company on 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.260
 the given throughput rate and watch 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.240
 we simply that the code must now 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.470
 not necessarily always the same 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.970
 out of the water but if we are now 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.220
 collected in the mechanical filter 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.720
 and the koi are not permanently there 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.580
 floats and above all the biological 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.440
 filter is not charged then 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.010
 that's already done so now 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.290
 look here times the turbidity at but 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.360
 Also on the subject I repeat that in 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.160
 Lately more and more often to the 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.560
 theme we will still many many blogs 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.960
 because that's just important, though 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.660
 the topic is on the other side as well 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.640
 again so complex that you can not do that 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.920
 Whole topic can kill in one 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.690
 that the extensive so without doing or 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.910
 be kept without major feeding 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.890
 i have a hard time or to blog in 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.530
 Shock already said that are 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.000
 all very slim so have the 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.530
 combination factor there he goes against 1 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.120
 as against two and not only the 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.860
 The females and the females are also male 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.170
 number of pieces I am sure we will 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.280
 also every winter becomes or one or 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:03.380
 others change 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.560
 but that is all alone 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.920
 Regulation the natural regulation 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.920
 survival of the fittest 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:17.369
 the water is in spite of its testing 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.900
 it looks very fresh inviting so 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:21.719
 do not reject it, there are also 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.309
 no actual odors what you get 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:29.279
 by the way, even with small particles 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:31.909
 already often smells when the cloudiness 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.909
 build code 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.590
 then it starts very fast too 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.509
 an unpleasant smell noticeable 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.069
 By the way, also his room look there 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.539
 I only run on the particles and none 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.580
 after two minutes say in the last 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:50.080
 time greater volumes side space led 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:54.699
 been or not so they do their 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.990
 head and the other fallen with 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.960
 the wrong interpretation 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.460
 love the cross with the back that is indeed 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.370
 on the one hand right and even 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.949
 Part of the survival strategy of 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.729
 buy but we have to be very clear 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.099
 distinguish 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:12.099
 what kind of cloudiness it is and there 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:15.490
 you in your pond nutrient-poor soil 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:17.919
 for demente but then algal bloom 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.560
 or code should it be in case that 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.729
 bring cool and urgent 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.379
 be switched off 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.960
 In this sense, I must urgently now 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:30.039
 into the hotel because here burn planet 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.310
 so we have here 35 degrees and 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:35.729
 still the nearly 100 discussed 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.729
 percent humidity
