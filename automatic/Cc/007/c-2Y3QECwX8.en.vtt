00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
on here

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.010 
on here
we<00:01:04.710> started<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.130> code<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.690> start

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
we started this code here and we start

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.410 
we started this code here and we start
on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> open<00:01:07.710> e<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.510> then<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.630> simply<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:11.420> D

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
on the open e and then we simply do a D

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.170 
on the open e and then we simply do a D
and<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:16.190> then<00:01:17.190> we<00:01:17.310> move<00:01:17.550> from<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:17.910> high<00:01:18.150> E

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and a and then we move from the high E

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.440 
and a and then we move from the high E
and<00:01:18.630> used<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> upward<00:01:20.070> strokes<00:01:26.090> quite<00:01:27.090> simple

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and used to upward strokes quite simple

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.920 
and used to upward strokes quite simple
really

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
really

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.770 
really
then<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:29.220> basically<00:01:29.729> repeat<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.540> whole

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
then we basically repeat that whole

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530 
then we basically repeat that whole
thing<00:01:31.580> over<00:01:32.580> here<00:01:32.610> which<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> five<00:01:33.510> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
thing over here which is on the five and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
thing over here which is on the five and
seven<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:39.710> then<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.800> slide<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.070> once<00:01:41.520> again<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
seven and then we slide up once again to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.920 
seven and then we slide up once again to
the<00:01:42.869> third<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> fifth<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.479> end<00:01:48.690> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the third and fifth and then we end that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.859 
the third and fifth and then we end that
with<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.290> E<00:01:49.500> minor<00:01:49.710> code<00:01:53.240> but<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.479> end

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
