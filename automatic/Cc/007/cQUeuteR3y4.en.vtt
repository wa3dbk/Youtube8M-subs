00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.510 
video we're going to be taking a look at
triple<00:00:08.910> turbo<00:00:09.180> is<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:10.170> real<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.950> fake<00:00:11.309> you

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
triple turbo is it real is it fake you

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.310 
triple turbo is it real is it fake you
guys<00:00:11.700> will<00:00:11.850> find<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.270> this<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.230> if

so you get my daily GTA 5 videos right
away<00:00:20.900> let's<00:00:21.900> get<00:00:22.080> into<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.609> off

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
away let's get into this so first off

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.189 
away let's get into this so first off
we're<00:00:23.970> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.330> testing<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
we're going to be testing it with the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.439 
we're going to be testing it with the
voltic<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> black<00:00:26.039> voltic<00:00:26.609> has<00:00:26.759> turbo<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
voltic the black voltic has turbo and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.269 
voltic the black voltic has turbo and
the<00:00:27.570> purple<00:00:27.929> does<00:00:28.109> not<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> people

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the purple does not now a lot of people

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
the purple does not now a lot of people
that<00:00:29.609> say<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> turbo<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:30.630> work<00:00:30.900> they

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that say that the turbo does work they

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.960 
that say that the turbo does work they
say<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.619> only<00:00:31.800> works<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.580> voltage

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
say that it only works on the voltage

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.270 
say that it only works on the voltage
you<00:00:33.420> guys<00:00:33.600> will<00:00:33.780> also<00:00:34.260> notice<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you guys will also notice that a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
you guys will also notice that a
majority<00:00:35.490> of<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:36.120> raced<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.170> against

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
majority of them raced them up against

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.410 
majority of them raced them up against
different<00:00:37.920> cars<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.340> can't<00:00:38.640> judge<00:00:39.180> when

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
different cars you can't judge when

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600 
different cars you can't judge when
you're<00:00:39.539> racing<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:40.020> voltage<00:00:40.469> against<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.399> adder

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you're racing a voltage against an adder

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.360 
you're racing a voltage against an adder
or<00:00:41.850> Turismo<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> same<00:00:43.710> car<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
or Turismo it's not the same car so the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
or Turismo it's not the same car so the
acceleration<00:00:44.660> top<00:00:45.660> speed<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.440> stuff<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
acceleration top speed all that stuff is

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
acceleration top speed all that stuff is
going<00:00:46.949> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.129> different<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.699> don't<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.420> if

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
going to be different I don't know if

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.599 
going to be different I don't know if
people<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.170> design<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.520> was

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
people did that by design or if it was

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.369 
people did that by design or if it was
just<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:51.030> accident<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.109> guys<00:00:52.230> will

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
just an accident but you guys will

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
just an accident but you guys will
notice<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.760> against

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
notice that when you do this up against

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840 
notice that when you do this up against
two<00:00:54.300> voltix<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.020> exactly<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> same<00:00:55.980> nothing

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
two voltix it's exactly the same nothing

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.750 
two voltix it's exactly the same nothing
has<00:00:57.180> changed<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:58.050> triple<00:00:58.440> turbo

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
has changed this is with triple turbo

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
has changed this is with triple turbo
I've<00:00:59.760> done<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.180> multiple<00:01:00.420> times<00:01:00.690> multiple

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
I've done this multiple times multiple

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100 
I've done this multiple times multiple
races<00:01:01.769> we<00:01:02.100> switch<00:01:02.429> drivers<00:01:02.929> nothing<00:01:03.929> has

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
races we switch drivers nothing has

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.110 
races we switch drivers nothing has
changed<00:01:04.590> its<00:01:04.710> exact<00:01:05.190> same<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.790> something

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
changed its exact same now something

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.030 
changed its exact same now something
that<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> people<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.870> say<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.350> say

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that a lot of people do say that say

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520 
that a lot of people do say that say
that<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.369> true<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.570> say<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that is true they say that it's not the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.130 
that is true they say that it's not the
top<00:01:10.770> speed<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> acceleration<00:01:12.960> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
top speed but it's the acceleration that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.749 
top speed but it's the acceleration that
it<00:01:13.259> does<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.799> supposed<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.189> make<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
it does and it's supposed to make you

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.060 
it does and it's supposed to make you
accelerate<00:01:15.420> faster<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> guys<00:01:16.890> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
accelerate faster and as you guys can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
accelerate faster and as you guys can
see<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.790> seeing<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.600> think

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
see I'm just not seeing it I don't think

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.450 
see I'm just not seeing it I don't think
it<00:01:18.810> makes<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.049> difference<00:01:19.080> even<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.310> were

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it makes a difference even if you were

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.429 
it makes a difference even if you were
to<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> faster<00:01:21.450> acceleration<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> were

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
to get a faster acceleration if you were

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.140 
to get a faster acceleration if you were
to<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.829> your<00:01:22.920> top<00:01:23.220> speed<00:01:23.520> faster<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
to get to your top speed faster you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
to get to your top speed faster you
should<00:01:24.329> have<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> faster<00:01:25.170> time<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> should<00:01:25.740> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
should have a faster time you should be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.069 
should have a faster time you should be
faster<00:01:26.369> than<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> other<00:01:26.790> car<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
faster than the other car and as you

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.929 
faster than the other car and as you
guys<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.100> happening<00:01:29.310> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
guys can see it's just not happening so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
guys can see it's just not happening so
it's<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.780> true<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.140> fake<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.890> does<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.280> work

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's not true it's fake it does not work

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's not true it's fake it does not work
we<00:01:33.060> also<00:01:33.240> did<00:01:33.600> test<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> Franklin

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
we also did test it with to Franklin

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
we also did test it with to Franklin
buffalos<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.579> said<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> only

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
buffalos now they said that it only

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
buffalos now they said that it only
worked<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> voltaic<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.649> not<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
worked on the voltaic and not all the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.530 
worked on the voltaic and not all the
cars<00:01:38.399> but<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.759> did<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
cars but we did it just with the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
cars but we did it just with the
Franklin<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> test<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
Franklin just to test because the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.770 
Franklin just to test because the
Franklin<00:01:41.430> doesn't<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> very<00:01:42.570> good

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
Franklin doesn't have a very good

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380 
Franklin doesn't have a very good
acceleration<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.610> had<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.909> triple

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
acceleration so if one had the triple

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.520 
acceleration so if one had the triple
turbo<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.049> think<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.500> would

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
turbo you would think that it would

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.289 
turbo you would think that it would
definitely<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.369> lot<00:01:47.610> faster<00:01:47.850> than<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
definitely be a lot faster than the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
definitely be a lot faster than the
other<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.740> video<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.159> had<00:01:50.280> two

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
other one for this video we had two

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.270 
other one for this video we had two
black<00:01:50.850> Franklin's<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.570> had<00:01:51.780> no<00:01:52.619> turbo<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
black Franklin's that had no turbo and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
black Franklin's that had no turbo and
then<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> middle<00:01:53.729> one<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.450> chrome<00:01:54.719> one<00:01:54.960> did

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
then the middle one the chrome one did

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.569 
then the middle one the chrome one did
have<00:01:55.380> turbo<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> guys<00:01:56.189> could<00:01:56.369> tell

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
have turbo and as you guys could tell

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
have turbo and as you guys could tell
doesn't<00:01:57.420> make<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> difference<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> car

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
doesn't make a difference with the car

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
doesn't make a difference with the car
it<00:01:58.619> doesn't<00:01:58.979> work<00:01:59.159> triple<00:01:59.640> turbo<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> fake

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it doesn't work triple turbo is a fake

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.600 
it doesn't work triple turbo is a fake
now<00:02:01.259> there's<00:02:01.469> no<00:02:01.649> doubt<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.100> mind<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
now there's no doubt in my mind that it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.399 
now there's no doubt in my mind that it
is<00:02:02.640> completely<00:02:03.210> fake<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.380> chance

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
is completely fake but on the off chance

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.800 
is completely fake but on the off chance
that<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.070> did<00:02:05.310> slightly<00:02:05.700> work<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.630> not

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
that it did slightly work it's just not

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.210 
that it did slightly work it's just not
worth<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> amount<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> time<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
worth it for the amount of time that it

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
worth it for the amount of time that it
takes<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.670> mod<00:02:09.570> discs<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.410> mess<00:02:10.649> with

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
takes to mod discs are in to mess with

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.620 
takes to mod discs are in to mess with
all<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> stuff<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.580> then<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.240> into<00:02:12.510> an
