00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome to the next lesson on 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.060
 site creation is lesson number three and in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.919
 first two lessons we have already dealt with 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.170
 the question of choosing and registering a domain 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.030
 named and with the question of hosting if you donâ€™t 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.830
 watched the first two lessons 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.509
 see them here on this link and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.609
 today we will deal with very important 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.529
 The question is the choice and installation of the engine 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.449
 now I have a very difficult face 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 which engine to tell me 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 now I will explain why I want to tell 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 about two engines one engine is very 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.859
 is popular 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.730
 it's a wordpress engine and a lot 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 sites on the Internet 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.100
 made on this engine this engine 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 has its pros and cons what any 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 another engine and it was he who got 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
 huge popularity in the Internet 2 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.790
 the engine is also a free engine 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.200
 webasyst 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.030
 and he didn't get so wide 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 spread on the internet in my 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
 opinion simply because it is enough 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 new but nonetheless I consider it 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.480
 deserves attention especially if 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.460
 you will want 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 further turn your website into the Internet 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 the store then you have the engine, I already have a bass player 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 an application that allows you to do this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.750
 quick and easy 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.609
 In this lesson, I will still consider 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 webasyst engine installation 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.390
 he did not get so wide 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 spread as wordpress but it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 very easy to use engine and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.740
 I personally like him very much 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.150
 fast and modern since it came out 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.340
 not long ago but in one of the following 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.290
 rollers most likely it will be bonus 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.909
 video for this course and necessarily 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.920
 I will consider the installation process and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.259
 popular wordpress engine settings 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.369
 proceed to install the engine in order 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.680
 to install in the area 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.990
 go to the web site assist point ru 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.540
 through y and further on the right side we 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.159
 we press not start work attention 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.210
 a small button that you want 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.280
 press a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 download webasyst to install on your own 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.600
 server engine free we need 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 just download it and install on 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.369
 the following pages click download by 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.320
 the bass player downloaded the engine 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 webasyst and now we need files 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 which is in this archive is tor archive 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.979
 somehow transfer to our server 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.820
 one way is to copy the files 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.100
 via ftp 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.899
 however, sometimes this method does not work and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.420
 after copying files via ftp 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.850
 the engine does not want to run so I 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.829
 I recommend to go the other way and I will go 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.899
 this way too let's first 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.540
 we extract this archive that is, I have twice 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.560
 I click on it starts the archiver and I 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.110
 extract 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 the contents of this archive if you have 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.730
 the archive is not retrieved just download 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.430
 a program that can extract 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.260
 archiver such programs are easy to find at 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.770
 I have this archive extracted by 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 such a pretty program with an icon 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.489
 sheeps 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.989
 called a bunny but you can have 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.730
 Of course, another program should not 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.500
 you have problems with unpacking 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.489
 of this archive after extracting the archive from 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.620
 I have a folder with my engine files and 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.200
 I need the contents of this folder attention 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.450
 not the folder itself but the contents now 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.730
 upload to server as i will 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.290
 do i go inside the folder since 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.640
 I do not need the contents of the folder itself 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.610
 the contents are these two files 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.900
 directory in asus from his installer and 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.060
 multiple files 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.640
 and I can transfer these files to hosting 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.470
 in another archive in the zip archive that is, these 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.330
 I now compress the files in the zip archive 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.420
 right click on me it's just 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.670
 compress and I get a zip archive with 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.190
 these files again download the archiver 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.290
 which allows you to archive in zip or 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.299
 maybe it can be done by means 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.040
 operating system how do you do it 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.200
 I will not tell because it is very 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.799
 simple procedure and then this file 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.410
 zip archive 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.540
 I have to transfer to hosting like this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.549
 I will do at the top of the file list 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.340
 you see three icons first icon 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.170
 creates a new directory 2 icon 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.310
 creates a new file and a third icon 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.489
 allows you to upload your file to the server 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.790
 press this icon and using the button 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.569
 just a file choose our archive click ok 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.000
 and we wait while the file on the server is loaded I 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.190
 I'll pay attention to the important thing again 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.440
 what we need in the zip archive to compress 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.139
 the contents of this folder here is a bassist and 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.739
 further figures. frameworks first we 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.660
 go to this folder and then already 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.880
 select all files and 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.069
 archive some time will pass 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.500
 Here our archive is loaded and 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.049
 Now I click on this file select 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.419
 folder with the name of your site and near 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.769
 press the button to select it further 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.299
 click unpack archive 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.490
 unpacking i choose my 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.870
 test folder and also click 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.600
 unpack 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.000
 we see that the archive unpacked the file itself 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.169
 archive zip 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.169
 now we can already delete and 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.160
 try to go to our site again 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:44.070
 see what happens now see 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.350
 that our site already looks different and 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.910
 when you go to this site starts 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.800
 software installation process 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.449
 We can choose Russian and 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.010
 in the next video I will show how 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.990
 install and configure software 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.180
 software for your site in this 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.070
 video we uploaded files to our server 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.289
 install the engine but i think thats 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.210
 more convenient if the installation process itself will be 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.760
 brought to a separate lesson because there 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.410
 There are some nuances and if we consider 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.630
 it is in this lesson it will be too 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.729
 long lesson and it will bore you and 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.190
 reduce your attention so on this 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.020
 moment our lesson ends and wait 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.850
 the next lesson in which we will understand 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.860
 how to work with databases like 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.870
 connect databases to the engine and we 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.820
 create a login and password for the first 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.800
 user of our engine and after 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.120
 the next lesson your site will be already 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.090
 looks really like real 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.340
 site and we will only have to configure 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.200
 your site and fill with content 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.599
 be sure to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.789
 tell the video to your friends if any of 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.680
 your friends want to create your site 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.720
 one of the reasons why i write this 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.210
 the course is exactly what makes me very 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.490
 are often asked to help with the creation of the site and 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.250
 I decided that it would be more effective if 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.229
 Once I will write down the lessons and if someone from 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.270
 my friends and acquaintances will need a website 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.789
 I just give a link to this course and 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.979
 man launches his own 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:03.320
 site on this our lesson is over wait 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.320
 next lesson soon
