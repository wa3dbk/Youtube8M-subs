 percent I have jobs in the socket this culpepper mosquito that is 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.740
 my radius of action to the concession g8 km and everything conceptual 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.560
 I read very fast and if I arrive with the early Siena 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.930
 and I do not have to leave early because to avoid traffic, my works are 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.250
 much more calm with less stress 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.930
 generated more wealth put into the lighter forms of the increase of sant 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.490
 joan 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 and then it generated more income to the society to day my person and my company 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.860
 came 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.170
 set no 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.670
 and press 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.670
 ride a bike like you are with us with grandpa 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.070
 in kenneth's work vermeer the ball on first bike that's why I 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.810
 pushed without casters 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 this mecca and neither then I went back up like 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.230
 and it is that we all do it with the knee if you laugh that peace is father 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.610
 this is a bit like the discreet dollar noodle soup has a memory 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.960
 very old of happiness and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.410
 be good not 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.350
 ideal when 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.910
 I started going to high school 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.169
 back then we lived in tacubaya lira park 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.129
 we were going to command myself 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.189
 to the high school by bicycle 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.109
 as a dessert and therefore 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.679
 your frontmen like 12 minutes 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.699
 it will be low to Algeria 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.359
 to this this felicia activities of prayer you arrived 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.739
 if it is very fast 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.129
 and back pedaled up a little bit more but nothing happens 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.759
 then budding high school i ride a bicycle really like 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.999
 conveyance 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.789
 then the speed in new york fifteen years and there he uses the bicycle all the 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:43.180
 days 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.619
 because it is a city 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.849
 in which uses public transport the big metropolises new york paris and 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 istanbul the whole city exhibited bikes are used 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.540
 this simple if I move I move I enter a discrete I do not have to 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.629
 put legs and a cap not 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.669
 again the suit because it is a point of a way to transport 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:06.070
 Completely easy and comfortable and according to your physical capacity 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.519
 can be an athlete for bicycle menem 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.189
 for nothing if there are ladies of 60 years entered the Netherlands as a bicycle 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.089
 the england ambassador in which he moves by bicycle 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.519
 the best one of a donovan ambassador in an armored car with four 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.969
 motorcycles back is not necessary 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.659
 you ride a bike because it's the most luxurious way of transportation is the one 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.419
 I respect your time 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.799
 per hundred for example constituents and flower and flowers with a point of 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.340
 reference not to the socket 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.389
 at 20 minutes 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.209
 car an hour and a half 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.980
 also when you're in a car in my opinion in the summer 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.970
 in a bottling the level of rotation is such ken ham antlers thinking 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.999
 in that 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.609
 so basically you are 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.600
 this 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.050
 the rotations the inability d to do something 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.229
 when you are imprisoned by forces alien to you not 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.400
 yosano you solve it never every day you are at a level of frustration 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.599
 three hours 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.319
 then all societies have 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.759
 a one 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.439
 available time 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.579
 for for 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.650
 after cutting is a fascinating fact that he studied 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.259
 engineer in transit and what the public sanctifies I got tired of many years 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.650
 illia humans since the return of the Bronze Age 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:32.379
 use in two hours and 28 minutes of has your daily time in transportation 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:33.590
 they do it on foot 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.560
 that municipality they do it in planes they do it in trains they do it in what will be 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.699
 on roads not 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.170
 but they are more or less that time the other sections an hour and a half 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.280
 above the average time that we should allocate for transit this 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.499
 in our daily life 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:50.900
 then we have a 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.040
 100% no deficiency in use of our time 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.430
 and I from the photos hours 28 minutes 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.400
 if I make sums in a day 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.460
 tusk I use twenty-one minutes to transport me from 2 hours 28 environment 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.050
 you have two hours left 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.659
 basically I already have two more hours since wearable times 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.240
 to do nothing 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.710
 but I like it 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.999
 sew incredibly productive 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.159
 as for the risk and security that is a question that I 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.159
 they do when they hear about the secret gobi there 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.550
 I tell them is that I've never felt close 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.919
 neither movement speed 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.209
 It is greater than cars that are stopped 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.370
 and less than those who go 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.460
 great speed tarata with 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.849
 but I'm going right side 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:37.840
 without sim 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.540
 already in no problem the other motorists 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.559
 respects a lot more than what 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.669
 position may never what I felt cranny 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.669
 then the bicycle 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.570
 for his 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.719
 size 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:54.089
 lights and is invisible is a mosquito not 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:59.009
 and in that sense you have to be yourself as an alert cyclist of cars 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.509
 They do not have visibility that they do not see you 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.369
 those who perceive signs that ask us 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:09.039
 then when are you going to get on a cruise 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.969
 what I do I changed the lane to the mayor to the next hopefully the 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:13.860
 left 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.860
 for this 10 will make from on high 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.099
 if they have turned to the right and this one from the time I speak 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.409
 from this 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.960
 prepared before 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.990
 then as you learn to use the tubasa bicycle to take 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.779
 this strategy has silo 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.340
 of use of the road d with which you feel comfortable 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.189
 the bicycle 3 a 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.699
 next to the transport vehicle 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.009
 incredibly fast within a radius of 5 8 kilometers 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.360
 down that 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.320
 you move 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.430
 like water there is no 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.189
 no judge the case 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:53.659
 that's why he used it is a Basque practical issue, I do not do it anymore 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:59.019
 because it's a cause or why I wear the shirt for that and environmentalists 

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.709
 for the act
