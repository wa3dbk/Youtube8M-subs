ya tries to introduce you to you know
different<00:02:11.860> fighting<00:02:12.340> systems<00:02:12.730> give<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> an

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
different fighting systems give you an

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.640 
different fighting systems give you an
idea<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.540> how<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.720> games<00:02:13.990> were<00:02:14.110> balanced<00:02:14.500> out

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
idea of how the games were balanced out

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.840 
idea of how the games were balanced out
sounds<00:02:15.490> good

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
sounds good

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.910 
sounds good
the<00:02:16.270> problem<00:02:16.780> with<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.680> each

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the problem with that is is that each

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.670 
the problem with that is is that each
character<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.910> locked<00:02:19.900> into<00:02:20.230> their<00:02:20.410> fighting

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
character is locked into their fighting

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.740 
character is locked into their fighting
system<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.580> if<00:02:21.730> you've<00:02:21.850> ever<00:02:21.970> played<00:02:22.090> Capcom

system<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.959> you're<00:03:26.200> gonna<00:03:26.290> pretty<00:03:26.560> much<00:03:26.620> have

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
system so you're gonna pretty much have

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.940 
system so you're gonna pretty much have
to<00:03:26.890> look<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.220> up<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:29.140> yeah<00:03:29.410> that's<00:03:29.680> basically

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
to look it up so yeah that's basically

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.039 
to look it up so yeah that's basically
what<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.519> in<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.820> nutshell<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
what it is in a nutshell but the

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.960 
what it is in a nutshell but the
question<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.500> course<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:33.010> if<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.549> game<00:03:33.820> is

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the sprites looked like they came from

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.210 
the sprites looked like they came from
the<00:04:45.520> original<00:04:46.120> games<00:04:46.740> except<00:04:47.740> for<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.950> Street

the<00:04:49.900> alpha<00:04:50.170> sprites<00:04:50.470> in<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.880> but<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.030> can

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the alpha sprites in it but you can

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.670 
the alpha sprites in it but you can
definitely<00:04:52.480> see<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:52.990> difference<00:04:53.410> in<00:04:53.470> art

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
definitely see a difference in art

styles<00:04:54.100> and<00:04:54.250> they<00:04:54.430> don't<00:04:54.640> even<00:04:54.730> try<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.090> hide

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
styles and they don't even try to hide

styles and they don't even try to hide
it<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.080> definitely<00:04:56.500> poor<00:04:56.980> production

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
