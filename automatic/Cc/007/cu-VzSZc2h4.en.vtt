00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:24.870 
volume controls work I can use the
controls<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:14.140> skip<00:03:15.140> forward<00:03:15.440> or<00:03:16.330> skip<00:03:17.330> back<00:03:22.750> so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
controls to skip forward or skip back so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.540 
controls to skip forward or skip back so
everything<00:03:25.880> works<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:26.300> advertised<00:03:26.780> as<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.370> far

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
everything works as advertised as so far

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.580 
everything works as advertised as so far
what<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:29.000> see<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.510> as<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:30.110> standalone

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
what I can see is it as a standalone

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.290 
what I can see is it as a standalone
Bluetooth<00:03:31.280> set<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:33.310> it's<00:03:34.310> pretty<00:03:34.760> damn<00:03:34.970> good

the audio from this iPod is going to be
transferred<00:04:19.880> by<00:04:20.060> bluetooth<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:21.049> this

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
transferred by bluetooth to this

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.400 
transferred by bluetooth to this
waterproof<00:04:21.709> headset<00:04:22.670> okay<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:24.260> now<00:04:24.380> that

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
waterproof headset okay so now that

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:58.660 
waterproof headset okay so now that
we've<00:04:24.680> setup<00:04:24.950> let's<00:04:25.490> take<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.060> pool

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.240 

you

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.999 

so<00:05:03.250> what<00:05:03.400> do<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:03.729> I<00:05:04.740> have<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.770> lot<00:05:05.979> of

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
so what do I like I have a lot of

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.219 
so what do I like I have a lot of
Bluetooth<00:05:06.400> devices<00:05:06.789> a<00:05:07.330> bluetooth<00:05:07.780> headsets

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
Bluetooth devices a bluetooth headsets

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.679 
Bluetooth devices a bluetooth headsets
and<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:09.250> sound<00:05:09.550> quality<00:05:10.060> of<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.419> is

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
and the sound quality of this is

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.309 
and the sound quality of this is
probably<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.379> best<00:05:12.180> even<00:05:13.180> compared<00:05:13.719> to<00:05:13.990> my

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
probably the best even compared to my

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.080 
probably the best even compared to my
old<00:05:15.270> Motorola<00:05:16.270> s9<00:05:16.689> headset<00:05:17.409> so<00:05:18.340> sound<00:05:18.639> quality

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
old Motorola s9 headset so sound quality

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.029 
old Motorola s9 headset so sound quality
it's<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.990> winner<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.259> like<00:05:20.409> the<00:05:20.560> fact<00:05:20.740> that<00:05:20.949> you

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
it's a winner I like the fact that you

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.779 
it's a winner I like the fact that you
can<00:05:21.189> pair<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.819> the<00:05:22.240> iPad<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.930> iPhone

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
can pair it to the iPad and the iPhone

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.610 
can pair it to the iPad and the iPhone
simultaneously<00:05:24.789> and<00:05:25.030> if<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.330> phone<00:05:25.509> rings<00:05:25.750> it

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
simultaneously and if the phone rings it

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.200 
simultaneously and if the phone rings it
will<00:05:26.740> automatically<00:05:27.340> switch<00:05:27.490> from<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:27.879> iPad

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
will automatically switch from the iPad

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.510 
will automatically switch from the iPad
to<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.389> iPhone<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:29.500> phonecall<00:05:29.979> mode<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.490> that

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
to the iPhone to phonecall mode so that

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.309 
to the iPhone to phonecall mode so that
you<00:05:30.639> can<00:05:30.879> pick<00:05:31.210> up<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.419> call<00:05:31.629> and<00:05:31.870> chat<00:05:32.020> the

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
you can pick up the call and chat the

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.990 
you can pick up the call and chat the
things<00:05:32.500> I<00:05:32.590> don't<00:05:32.800> like<00:05:33.009> is<00:05:33.219> the<00:05:33.250> fact<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.729> the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
things I don't like is the fact that the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.959 
things I don't like is the fact that the
bag<00:05:34.210> is<00:05:34.240> kind<00:05:34.599> of<00:05:34.930> flimsy<00:05:35.919> and<00:05:36.340> this<00:05:36.580> strap<00:05:36.940> is

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
bag is kind of flimsy and this strap is

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.279 
bag is kind of flimsy and this strap is
a<00:05:37.180> bit<00:05:37.360> tight<00:05:37.629> for<00:05:37.659> my<00:05:38.020> arm<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.990> range

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
a bit tight for my arm the range

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.129 
a bit tight for my arm the range
underwater<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.099> limited<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.479> pretty<00:05:44.080> much

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
underwater is limited so you pretty much

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.950 
underwater is limited so you pretty much
have<00:05:44.349> to<00:05:44.379> attach<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.550> glue<00:05:46.419> to<00:05:46.449> your<00:05:46.599> receiver

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
have to attach the glue to your receiver

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.020 
have to attach the glue to your receiver
pretty<00:05:47.379> much<00:05:47.560> close<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.340> phone<00:05:48.580> if<00:05:48.819> you're

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
pretty much close to the phone if you're

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.059 
pretty much close to the phone if you're
underwater<00:05:49.509> so<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.289> other<00:05:50.409> complaint<00:05:50.800> I<00:05:50.889> had

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
underwater so the other complaint I had

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.469 
underwater so the other complaint I had
was<00:05:51.219> when<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.370> was<00:05:51.520> using<00:05:51.669> it<00:05:51.849> underwater<00:05:52.150> the

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
was when I was using it underwater the

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.450 
was when I was using it underwater the
length<00:05:52.719> of<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.080> cord<00:05:53.409> is<00:05:53.680> just<00:05:53.889> not<00:05:54.250> nearly

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
length of the cord is just not nearly

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.600 
length of the cord is just not nearly
long<00:05:54.759> enough<00:05:54.789> if<00:05:55.629> the<00:05:56.500> transmitter<00:05:57.129> has<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.520> be

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
long enough if the transmitter has to be

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.300 
long enough if the transmitter has to be
right<00:05:57.789> next<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.150> phone<00:05:58.650> but<00:05:59.650> that's<00:05:59.860> a

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
right next to the phone but that's a

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.629 
right next to the phone but that's a
relatively<00:06:00.939> small<00:06:01.509> gripe<00:06:01.840> I<00:06:02.250> have<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.279> feeling

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
relatively small gripe I have a feeling
