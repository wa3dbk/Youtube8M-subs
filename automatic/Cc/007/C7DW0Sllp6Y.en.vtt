00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 And it's here that you're welcome to come 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.210
 a video guys this time i'm back 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.210
 better not say the name of the player 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.119
 Claudia reminder guys I was 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 playing this week and I decided 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 do if I keep playing each 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.720
 What happens next week, I'll do the ppi of you. 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.000
 It's good to have spent a bit more 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 one week but come on I'm free and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.770
 19 I'm in the bronze alloy and this is mine. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.030
 City 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 there are several things I discovered 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.300
 playing as for example the most 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 effective you fend off attacks 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.760
 what are you doing a structure that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.090
 walls protecting their guns their 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.879
 resources is what it saves 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.280
 gold and what keeps elixir because these 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.000
 are the ones that usually have more 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.340
 swore from within them understood and then by 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.030
 out you leave all the rest hindering 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.210
 let the enemy put a creature 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.100
 or armies near your base then 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.830
 for him to get here in the cannon he goes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 have to destroy that garbage if it is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.900
 to think the truth I should put 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.189
 one more course, but this stone is bad 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 I was closing 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
 Another thing I did, guys, I 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 I understood this money. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.299
 this crap does not not stand the delay 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.329
 to buy a builder's hut is to 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.280
 consultant's cabin is essential is the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.979
 most important thing you can 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200
 to buy with emeralds at the beginning of the game 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.570
 even when you receive 500 in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 emeralds mano do not spend 500 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.420
 Improved for nothing in this world, you? 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.079
 pick them up and immediately buy one 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.409
 instructor hut do not do the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.020
 able to act lise your buildings 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.180
 your features do not do this will 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 buy portuguese because because how much 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.049
 The more hut you have the faster you 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.299
 will be able to evolve its 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.910
 buildings that each cabin that allows 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.250
 to evolve one thing more at the same time 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.110
 in touch I have two gold mines 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.060
 evolving and two 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580
 two of archers evolving at the same time 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
 time if I had only two 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.790
 consultant 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.680
 I was only able to have two girls 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.310
 gold and can not have it here evolving 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.260
 OK 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.970
 another thing that I found nice in this game 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.600
 and I've seen you playing, you can attack the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.150
 people 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.220
 I'm not even making that single anymore 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.860
 player that is stupid of me to do the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.750
 because there are many players here 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.460
 nice 67 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.740
 only it's worth it a lot more you 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.570
 attack the blacks I already have some 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.110
 Army ready to find someone. 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.230
 It's cool for us to attack. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.239
 every time you attack you win 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.220
 points on your line and you can steal 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.410
 certain features of the person for example 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.320
 here I can steal six thousand goal from 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.350
 7,000 to direct what is good what is 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.980
 really good until you had a goal to 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.620
 This guy is bad, does she have it and does that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.320
 that this cannon is a 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.090
 sack and if he wins he will destroy all 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.220
 my troops mainly in the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.920
 The strategy that I'm doing is to use 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
 these are just the usual little soldiers here 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.170
 There's no way to see if we can 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.920
 You have to separate them here so as not to give 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.920
 bullshit right 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.640
 at the time that would pay if these guys already 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 It's destroyed, it's okay. I'll put it here. 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.100
 for he studied the good golds that I 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.340
 I have enough troops right my my I 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.590
 I want them to destroy archers and then 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.450
 they come very close to the cannon one 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.660
 year can attack them but they do not 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.210
 are very close to the corner attacking him 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.820
 leaving the stoi all at the same time guy is 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.590
 a misfortune here we will hope that 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.780
 they can build this crap 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.910
 but the bastards of my face they 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.860
 never focus on the cannon 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.660
 they will always be all the others 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.340
 resources before you 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.410
 It 's what 's causing the most 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.140
 Damn I do not know why they do it 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.910
 but I think it 's destroying this one 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.320
 We're going to get it, do not look at it. 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.550
 what is over here destroys the cannon 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.020
 bigger first times here I think 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.740
 they will be able to destroy who is what 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.470
 It's good and this one is coming out of range. 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.290
 the great cannon get out of there malek bond 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.670
 stress that is a bastard as soon as I 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.210
 I think if they had the soundtrack 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.490
 direct comes to what is good and sad people 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.840
 Who can kill the rest? 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.080
 their beauty hc also a quantity 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.270
 Army here great to see I spent 60 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.300
 These guys to detonate, I'm going to 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.360
 steal that in 6 thousand downloads 6 thousand of t 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.560
 and I'm going to earn 800 of each as 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.750
 bonus because I'm in the league for 11 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.550
 As your league grows, it goes 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.370
 improving how much of you while 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.680
 because you win bonus there is no one 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.530
 be a strategy I learned in the 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.630
 what will you do if you put unity and 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.490
 will lose points and will lose the 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.470
 battles purposely for you 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.350
 decide to call and get the most guys 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.040
 only weak and evolving good there 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.350
 beauty 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.130
 it was worth to understand the 60 troops of this 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:33.470
 each unit of these elixir 50 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:35.480
 while at 60 and 50 Sunday 25 is 3 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.900
 I spent 3,000 thousand direct deluxe 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.870
 in this attack and that I will have 66 and 7 thousand 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.970
 garbage and 7,000 gold 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.590
 and it was good there what I do I have 3 to 1 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.860
 I have three noises that train 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.660
 troops the barracks and then I let him 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.940
 training at full steam the most 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.580
 it 's because I allow myself 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.850
 training for example and 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.650
 if this girl here she takes 25 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.190
 seconds of training this guy here takes time 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.740
 20 is that the swimsuit is faster to train and 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.320
 This one is very expensive and this guy who is 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.330
 cheaper then it is a strategy that 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.920
 I get doped only for who only I 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.890
 I want several numbers that I always 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.740
 attacking I always building up 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.670
 building a kiss but I still want 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.500
 Income Tips guys she says sainha 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.230
 I 'm not fully developed yet 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.640
 at most I will be fighting for 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:36.190
 get 1,500 gold 150 thousand goal 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.870
 10 to develop the village is because it has 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.430
 several things that I want to evolve more 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.860
 I can not evolve because I need 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.140
 update the village center that is the 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.220
