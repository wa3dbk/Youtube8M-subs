00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's make a selfie stick!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.460
I cut a piece of bamboo from a garden troch

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.760
Then I sawed it in half

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.300
I glued strong neodymium magnets on both sticks

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.460
I applied more glue

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.040
to make sure we have a good bond

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.820
Then I glued and wrapped

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.520
the string around the bamboo

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.340
to make a handle

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.180
I picked up a cheap mobile phone holder for the car

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.280
I took it apart and cut off the ball head

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
I glued it to the stick

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.900
I also picked up a bluetooth shutter release remote

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.460
To keep things simple, I tied it to the handle

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020
When stick is folded

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.700
It's small enough to carry it in your bag

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.860
Or you can carry it with a phone holder already attached

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.900
Magnets and gravity

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.100
will let you open the stick - Just like that!

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300
Even with a mobile phone attached

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.280
you can open the stick with one hand

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340
Bluetooth remote will let you take pictures

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.220
without using the timer

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.540
Oh Yeah!

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.160
If you are in the city

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.520
and you want to take a photo of your full body

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.200
No problems!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.460
Magnets will let you attach the stick

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.420
to almost any lamp post

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.940
What did you think?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.180
