00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
is just how I'm doing my tree I'm not

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
is just how I'm doing my tree I'm not
saying<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> safe<00:00:25.260> way<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.890> it

would say but for everybody I would say

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
would say but for everybody I would say
just<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:33.329> look<00:00:33.540> through<00:00:33.809> instructions<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
just to look through instructions and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
just to look through instructions and
figure<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> safest<00:00:36.930> way

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
figure out how to do it the safest way

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.830 
figure out how to do it the safest way
so<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.579> look<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.120> videos<00:00:39.450> last

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
so if you look through the videos last

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.319 
so if you look through the videos last
year<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> same<00:00:41.370> tree<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
year you can see the same tree and it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.240 
year you can see the same tree and it
wasn't<00:00:42.540> lighting<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.230> certain<00:00:43.590> spots<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
wasn't lighting in certain spots so I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970 
wasn't lighting in certain spots so I
had<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.809> store<00:00:46.110> manager<00:00:46.710> would

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
had to go out the store manager would

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
had to go out the store manager would
not<00:00:47.160> replace<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.239> trees<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.780> ahead<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> walk

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
not replace the trees go ahead and walk

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.360 
not replace the trees go ahead and walk
by<00:00:49.800> light<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.690> air<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.770> light<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
by light the first air was the light I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.260 
by light the first air was the light I
bought<00:00:53.850> white<00:00:54.360> white<00:00:55.140> boards<00:00:56.030> instead<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
bought white white boards instead of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.190 
bought white white boards instead of
green<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> see

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
green so as you can see

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.230 
green so as you can see
I<00:01:00.290> strung<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.160> sections<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:01.910> we're

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
I strung the sections that we're

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.190 
I strung the sections that we're
inviting<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.780> top<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:04.160> middle<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.910> then<00:01:05.840> I

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
inviting the top the middle and then I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440 
inviting the top the middle and then I
decided<00:01:06.770> I'm<00:01:07.220> still<00:01:07.640> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.880> put<00:01:08.030> these<00:01:08.180> on

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
decided I'm still going to put these on

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.290 
decided I'm still going to put these on
towards<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.380> bottom<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:10.490> don't<00:01:11.000> want<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.210> make

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
towards the bottom I don't want to make

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.950 
towards the bottom I don't want to make
this<00:01:11.450> really<00:01:11.750> long<00:01:12.020> video<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:13.750> excuse<00:01:14.750> me

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
this really long video so then excuse me

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.700 
this really long video so then excuse me
and<00:01:15.820> then<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.030> started<00:01:17.270> stuffing<00:01:17.750> batting<00:01:18.530> I

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
and then I started stuffing batting I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.200 
and then I started stuffing batting I
thought<00:01:19.070> what<00:01:19.370> would<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.550> tree<00:01:19.940> in<00:01:20.120> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
thought what would a tree in the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.910 
thought what would a tree in the
wilderness<00:01:20.479> look<00:01:21.050> like<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.560> was<00:01:21.680> just

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
wilderness look like that was just

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.710 
wilderness look like that was just
getting<00:01:22.220> pummeled<00:01:22.460> with<00:01:22.729> snow<00:01:23.150> because

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
getting pummeled with snow because

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.330 
getting pummeled with snow because
that's<00:01:23.930> what<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.140> want<00:01:24.410> my<00:01:24.530> tree<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.950> look<00:01:25.100> like

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's what I want my tree to look like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.940 
that's what I want my tree to look like
so<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.060> started<00:01:26.570> stuffing<00:01:26.930> batting<00:01:27.590> on<00:01:27.800> the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
so I started stuffing batting on the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.640 
so I started stuffing batting on the
inside<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.790> cover<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.300> trunk<00:01:29.720> because<00:01:30.500> there

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
inside to cover the trunk because there

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.730 
inside to cover the trunk because there
was<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.800> lot<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.160> empty<00:01:32.150> like<00:01:32.570> bear<00:01:32.900> room<00:01:33.320> it's

took it sprayed it intersection and I
will<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.670> course<00:03:33.730> have<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.420> lay<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> sheet<00:03:35.590> down

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
will of course have to lay a sheet down

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.729 
will of course have to lay a sheet down
towards<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.489> bottom<00:03:36.670> right<00:03:37.500> now<00:03:38.500> we're
