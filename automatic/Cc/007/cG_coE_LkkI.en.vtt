gun and in this video I will be

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189 
gun and in this video I will be
continuing<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.789> from<00:00:20.939> there<00:00:21.240> by<00:00:21.750> talking<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
continuing on from there by talking to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
continuing on from there by talking to
you<00:00:22.410> about<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.800> utility<00:00:23.369> defense<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you about the utility defense and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.089 
you about the utility defense and
performance<00:00:24.900> slot<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.470> Liberator

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
performance slot for the Liberator

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
performance slot for the Liberator
so<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.570> let's<00:00:28.199> get

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
so with that out of the way let's get

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.669 
so with that out of the way let's get
started<00:00:29.240> first<00:00:30.240> off<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.810> utility<00:00:31.470> which

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
started first off is utility which

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.069 
started first off is utility which
consists<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> four<00:00:32.550> abilities<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.690> decoy

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
consists of four abilities the decoy

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
consists of four abilities the decoy

and<00:00:36.840> afterburner

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and afterburner

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.650 
and afterburner
now<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> bat<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> start

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
now right off the bat I want to start

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
now right off the bat I want to start
off<00:00:39.809> by<00:00:39.840> labeling<00:00:40.440> two<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> these<00:00:40.890> abilities

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
off by labeling two of these abilities

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.760 
off by labeling two of these abilities
as<00:00:41.670> bad<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.360> Liberator<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> decoy

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
as bad for the Liberator the decoy

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.150 
as bad for the Liberator the decoy
flares<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.460> ejection<00:00:45.090> system<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> reason<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
flares and ejection system the reason I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
flares and ejection system the reason I
say<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:47.969> guided<00:00:48.629> Rockets<00:00:49.050> do

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
say this is because guided Rockets do

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.770 
say this is because guided Rockets do
very<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.710> damage<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> liberators<00:00:50.780> roughly

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
very little damage to liberators roughly

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
very little damage to liberators roughly
around<00:00:51.899> nine<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.680> twelve<00:00:52.980> percent<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> their

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
around nine to twelve percent of their

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.270 
around nine to twelve percent of their
maximum<00:00:54.239> health<00:00:54.680> max<00:00:55.680> level<00:00:55.980> fire

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
maximum health max level fire

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
maximum health max level fire
suppression<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.090> heal<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:58.170> much<00:00:58.379> if

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
suppression will heal just as much if

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
suppression will heal just as much if
not<00:00:58.680> more<00:00:58.920> than<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.820> lock-on<00:01:00.329> rocket<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
not more than what one lock-on rocket is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.709 
not more than what one lock-on rocket is
capable<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.440> doing<00:01:02.059> second<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> ejection

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
capable of doing second is the ejection

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
capable of doing second is the ejection
system<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> say<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
system and all I can say about this

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
system and all I can say about this
ability<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.600> basically<00:01:07.110> giving<00:01:07.350> up

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
ability is you're basically giving up

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350 
ability is you're basically giving up
fighting<00:01:07.920> power<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.909> kill<00:01:09.119> death

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
fighting power to make your kill death

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.929 
fighting power to make your kill death
ratio<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:10.080> pretty<00:01:10.640> seriously

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
ratio look pretty seriously

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
ratio look pretty seriously
if<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.350> you're<00:01:13.500> doing<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
if you use this all you're doing is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.289 
if you use this all you're doing is
pissing<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> pilots<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> shoot<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
pissing off the pilots that shoot you

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.660 
pissing off the pilots that shoot you
down<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> looking<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.409> an<00:01:16.590> asshole<00:01:16.770> don't

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
down and looking like an asshole don't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
down and looking like an asshole don't
use<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> leaves<00:01:19.799> us<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> fire

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
use it so that leaves us with the fire

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
use it so that leaves us with the fire
suppression<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> afterburner<00:01:21.990> now

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
suppression in the afterburner now

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
suppression in the afterburner now
personally<00:01:23.310> between<00:01:23.490> these<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:23.970> abilities<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
personally between these two abilities I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
personally between these two abilities I
would<00:01:24.780> pick<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> afterburner<00:01:25.590> simply

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
would pick the afterburner simply

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.490 
would pick the afterburner simply
because<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> has<00:01:26.580> countless<00:01:27.119> uses<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
because it has countless uses if you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.649 
because it has countless uses if you
know<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:28.920> doing<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> however<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
know you're doing with it however if you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
know you're doing with it however if you
don't<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.079> spend<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> certs<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> or

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
don't want to spend the certs on it or

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
don't want to spend the certs on it or
you're<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.759> skilled<00:01:33.090> enough<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you're just not skilled enough with the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
you're just not skilled enough with the
Liberator<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.110> would<00:01:34.380> recommend<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> fire

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
Liberator I would recommend the fire

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
Liberator I would recommend the fire
suppression<00:01:35.400> next<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> defense

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
suppression next we have the defense

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
suppression next we have the defense

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.999 
repair now between the two of them I
would<00:02:09.270> recommend<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> auto<00:02:10.020> repair<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.679> most

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
would recommend the auto repair for most

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.550 
would recommend the auto repair for most
situations<00:02:11.390> however<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.750> compass<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.230> armor

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
situations however the compass in armor
does<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.190> its<00:02:14.430> uses<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.720> right

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
this those situations have become far

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
this those situations have become far
and<00:02:20.730> few<00:02:20.940> between<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.290> probably

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and few between so you're probably

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.089 
and few between so you're probably
better<00:02:22.950> off<00:02:23.099> sticking<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> auto<00:02:24.180> repair

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
better off sticking with the auto repair

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.130 
better off sticking with the auto repair
if<00:02:26.099> on<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> off<00:02:26.880> chance<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.720> want<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.020> use

if on the off chance you do want to use

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.870 
if on the off chance you do want to use
the<00:02:28.319> flak<00:02:28.530> armor<00:02:28.920> though<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:29.400> recommend

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the flak armor though I would recommend

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.729 
the flak armor though I would recommend
running<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> fire<00:02:30.900> suppression<00:02:31.140> for
