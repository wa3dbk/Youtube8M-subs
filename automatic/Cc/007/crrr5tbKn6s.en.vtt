right<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.030> inside<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.019> driver

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
right here on the inside of the driver

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
right here on the inside of the driver
side<00:00:13.769> door<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.700> memory<00:00:14.969> seat<00:00:15.210> controls

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
memory technology comes in handy see if

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
memory technology comes in handy see if
I<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.989> short<00:00:34.170> person<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.100> would

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I was a really short person all I would

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.049 
I was a really short person all I would
have<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.940> first<00:00:36.210> adjust<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.989> seat

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
have to do is first adjust my seat

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.610 
have to do is first adjust my seat
closer<00:00:39.059> maybe<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.989> want<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
closer maybe I would want to have the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
closer maybe I would want to have the
angle<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> seat<00:00:41.809> higher<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
angle of the seat higher like this so it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
angle of the seat higher like this so it
would<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.090> comfortable<00:00:45.680> okay<00:00:46.680> now

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
would be a lot more comfortable okay now

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
would be a lot more comfortable okay now

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
is hold down my memory button I'm using

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.990 
is hold down my memory button I'm using
number<00:01:38.200> one<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.740> it'll<00:01:39.369> take<00:01:39.520> me<00:01:39.549> right<00:01:39.670> back

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
just like so as you can see this is a

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.449 
just like so as you can see this is a
lot<00:01:44.200> more<00:01:44.229> comfortable<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:48.100> looks<00:01:48.130> like

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
lot more comfortable it looks like

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.100 
lot more comfortable it looks like
somebody<00:01:49.179> is<00:01:49.240> messed<00:01:49.600> with<00:01:49.750> my<00:01:50.020> memory<00:01:50.380> seats

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.700 

but<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.190> get<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.460> idea<00:01:54.490> how<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:54.940> works<00:01:55.710> all

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
but you get the idea how it works all

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.810 
but you get the idea how it works all
right<00:01:56.830> so<00:01:56.980> that's<00:01:57.070> how<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.340> adjust<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
right so that's how you adjust the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.750 
right so that's how you adjust the
memory<00:01:57.970> seats<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.380> Audi's<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.010> it's<00:02:00.580> also

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
memory seats in the Audi's and it's also

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.340 
memory seats in the Audi's and it's also
important<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.360> note<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.600> it'll<00:02:02.050> remember

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
important to note that it'll remember
