00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.449
 and in this video he talks about the difference 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.449
 between the Latin version and respect 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.119
 In general, the islands are much more 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.830
 respectful if you go to a concert 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.450
 example and has a numbered seat is 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.160
 they stay in this seat and they do not walk 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.989
 pushing a cause instead the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.650
 Latinas are much crazier they give us what 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.940
 same 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.739
 we try everything counting to get the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.800
 first row the same if they ask you the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.870
 hair squeeze that you stick or paste the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 theme that we have here is to kill or die 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.770
 watch out 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.770
 OK 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 Y 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.080
 then the world goes for the rhymes 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.790
 passion Latinas we are very very very 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.440
 passionate we sing it from 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.300
 Concert status from start to finish 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.170
 over artists are always so 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.250
 impressed 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.250
 they say we are the best july 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 On the other hand, the gringas are their perfumes 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.100
 Super slow because they sing barely 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 move and there is no deal for that reason this point 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.229
 for Latinas and Latinas always 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.119
 they are feeling like real ones 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.560
 rockstar of our artist because 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.689
 when they come we perceive them for all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.689
 parts the airport and in the full hotel 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.729
 instead the Greeks as they are 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.050
 accustomed to having them their country not the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.030
 he's still not going to look for them at the airport 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.340
 from heaven wayne with luck they are going to 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.300
 say hello then this point also goes 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.440
 for us Latinas friendship 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.090
 we Latinas have a lot 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.620
 ease to make friends like 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.330
 we go to the hotel to the airport 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.040
 we arrive obviously from this area 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.239
 we have a lot of time to talk with 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.250
 all the girls are at our 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.670
 around so we become thousands and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.670
 thousands of friends 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.210
 I like floors 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.310
 but it does not have it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.530
 On the other hand, the Incas 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.530
 they take a few minutes 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.270
 we met for that reason 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.420
 then again the point is for the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.420
 latinas 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.140
 know them for much more lines 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.000
 easy in contrast to them since 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.890
 them in their normal life to buy the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.170
 bread but could be found in the market 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.760
 or the starbucks and they there more 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.030
 more relaxed than one can approach and 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.030
 bale 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.270
 instead, in Latin America it is much more 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.370
 hard to meet him because they always have 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.070
 very safely arrive hidden from the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.440
 airport to the hotel and the obligation of 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.480
 see it is maybe they greet each other at the hotel and 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.080
 the concert and how to get to know them 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080
 big step 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.720
 so we 're tied to see 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.130
 that Latinas do not have so much that 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.390
 they lose the clinic because if we 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.940
 we try a little bit that I have a little 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.980
 of luck we will get to know and so 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.140
 our most up bookmark can we 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.550
 win by beating the gringas and good that 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.320
 was our video today I hope that you 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.150

 I like that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.360
 in this sense it has happened to me 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.470
 this day I leave you with a backdrop 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.470
 for the fat 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.729
 ah 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.560
 why 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.350
 and so 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 before

 one last time
