top three to five pick and i think under

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.870 
top three to five pick and i think under
most<00:02:41.530> circumstances<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:42.430> would<00:02:42.550> be<00:02:42.730> an

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
most circumstances that would be an

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.660 
most circumstances that would be an
obvious<00:02:43.570> avenue<00:02:44.320> in<00:02:44.500> which<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.430> know<00:02:45.520> there

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
obvious avenue in which you know there

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.340 
obvious avenue in which you know there
would<00:02:45.760> be<00:02:45.820> very<00:02:45.970> little<00:02:46.330> decision<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.170> make

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
would be very little decision to make

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.860 
would be very little decision to make
but<00:02:47.560> i<00:02:47.650> think<00:02:47.920> joe<00:02:48.160> i'm<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:49.120> i<00:02:49.450> should<00:02:49.510> speak
