 flash videos today in flushing meadows 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:48.719
 we have to wipe our mouths and 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 attack the freezer and then 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:57.260
 then you must think the drink 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.859
 fill two centimeters to the ligna 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:10.380
 subject to yes then we only had to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:12.119
 wait and see here and only stands 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.010
 cooled drinks and the colder the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.729
 drink is the better the result 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.159
 his 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 so now had our red in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.869
 Berlin also in the freezer 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.970
 hour is about and the sa china 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.009
 since this morning at 10 now hammas at 7 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 when we now have nine hours in the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.930
 had freezer and you should not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.720
 light drinks and no unresolved 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.909
 Take drinks for it or I would 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.240
 say you really appreciate that 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.829
 So get out and bottle it 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 pointed to two inches below the edge 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.409
 only be made full that circa 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.530
 220 milliliter so the lid from now 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.530
 screw 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.260
 Now we introduce the one notes 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.850
 So nice c 2 10 meters and on the edge in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.850
 the middle see the better 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.690
 the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.050
 he died 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 clear 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.760
 it's about twice now 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.210
 and where is it about good so now 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.350
 Let's stand this a little bit and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:58.020
 Although a minute after that has the camera 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.770
 Maybe that minute is around now 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.450
 sometimes the lid on it to buy so 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.520
 it was really nice to have it all out 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.020
 button 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.490
 there must be this effort now becomes below 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.810
 how gracious had indeed been just keep 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.810
 and start kneading now 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.080
 it works right if you do not 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:31.250
 You give everything you come quickly 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.250
 they recommend you already 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.610
 it's already done you see how 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.900
 fast that is really short again 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.900
 keep a little bit out of focus and pure 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.950
 my knowledge until just action too 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.950
 Knead a little bit down 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.300
 that's the whole thing now we have 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.790
 Kneaded about two minutes and yes the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.720
 both test first and always if that 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.720
 whole tastes 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:37.120
 how watery that is ours behind the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.120
 ear exactly 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:54.610
 home the browser number the 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:58.320
 consistency of the stuff tastes right 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.320
 this is down on the floor 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:31.600
 refreshing yes at the moment probably also spoon 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.140
 I have to look close again 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.140
 little bit on it 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.850
 okay is a cool thing, it is pointless 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.860
 What does that say refreshing in the summer 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.860
 we are really shepherd 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.880
 So why water ice determines what 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.949
 is cracked or against 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.949
 super fast would not have thought 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:11.550
 So you see the spoons are doing so 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.950
 in the video I have you all the yes 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.840
 ever presented 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.670
 we had two others there and me 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.350
 But we noticed that we two from 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.390
 shield factor have as two 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:29.280
 I'll see if it's any 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:30.900
 difference is there but it is clear there 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.170
 there I guess look 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.030
 I'm curious the tests I will 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:56.360
 then perform because the two then 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:59.190
 drive the holidays and you are okay 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.300
 then yes , I think it's really cool 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.220
 I did not think so 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.930
 Quickly we have the limo 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.390
 reingemacht started to knead and 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.970
 already somehow it's the same 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:15.620
 minute were more like that 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:15.620
 age of us is German only 2 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:27.440
 I now try to equal 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.440
 So that was us first videos
