00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
on a glitch I hopefully the microphone

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.060 
on a glitch I hopefully the microphone
quality<00:00:14.610> will<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:14.969> good<00:00:15.210> because<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.380> had<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.860> lot

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
quality will be good because I had a lot

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.250 
quality will be good because I had a lot
of<00:00:17.099> problems<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.730> getting<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.990> sound

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
of problems with getting the you sound

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.370 
of problems with getting the you sound
bored<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.310> Sun<00:00:20.490> car<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> work<00:00:21.200> as<00:00:22.200> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
bored in the Sun car to work as it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.490 
bored in the Sun car to work as it
should<00:00:22.410> without<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:24.239> was<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.020> a<00:00:25.050> background

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
should without it was like a background

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.350 
should without it was like a background
noise<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.919> it<00:00:26.040> but<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.579> figured<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
noise on it but I figured out the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.510 
noise on it but I figured out the
background<00:00:27.509> noise<00:00:27.750> was<00:00:28.079> like<00:00:28.290> whining<00:00:29.070> from

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
background noise was like whining from

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.960 
background noise was like whining from
the<00:00:29.700> GPU<00:00:30.119> card<00:00:30.619> but<00:00:31.619> i<00:00:31.919> think<00:00:32.460> i<00:00:32.550> fixed<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> now

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
the GPU card but i think i fixed it now

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.120 
the GPU card but i think i fixed it now
so<00:00:33.210> that's<00:00:33.420> why<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.380> our<00:00:34.560> that's<00:00:34.980> why<00:00:35.100> i

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so that's why that was our that's why i

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.920 
so that's why that was our that's why i
didn't<00:00:35.340> record<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> past<00:00:36.899> few<00:00:38.630> days<00:00:39.630> but
