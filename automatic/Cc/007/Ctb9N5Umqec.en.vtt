try to get sympathy for them

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.580 
try to get sympathy for them
particularly<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.910> they're<00:00:30.150> humanoid<00:00:30.750> inform

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.000 

mythology<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> legends<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.790> rather

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
mythology and legends all have rather

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.220 
mythology and legends all have rather
strange<00:00:38.010> creatures<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:39.989> call

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
strange creatures and some people call

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.150 
strange creatures and some people call
monsters<00:00:41.090> but<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:43.590> they<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
monsters but I think they all have a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
monsters but I think they all have a
symbolism<00:00:50.030> well<00:00:51.030> given<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.989> sympathy

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
symbolism well given that the sympathy

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.779 
symbolism well given that the sympathy
that<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> try<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> elicit<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.699> your

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that you try to elicit for your

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.760 
that you try to elicit for your
creatures<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.110> feel<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> they're

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
creatures how do you feel that they're

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.439 
creatures how do you feel that they're
always<00:00:55.920> destroyed<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.820> films<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> at

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
always destroyed in your films and at

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
always destroyed in your films and at
the<00:00:57.539> first<00:00:57.690> reaction<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> creatures<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the first reaction to the creatures is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.549 
the first reaction to the creatures is
to<00:00:59.460> destroy<00:00:59.850> them<00:01:00.030> well<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.410> to

amount of violence but to create a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.630 
amount of violence but to create a
climax<00:01:53.289> language<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:55.080> unfortunately<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:57.490> you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
climax language and unfortunately if you

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.169 
climax language and unfortunately if you
have<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.909> hero<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.770> get<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.369> gut<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.610> let<00:02:00.939> him

win<00:02:01.479> rather<00:02:01.929> than<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.470> creature<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:05.229> do<00:02:05.350> you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
win rather than the creature what do you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.460 
win rather than the creature what do you
think<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:05.740> modern<00:02:06.220> sama<00:02:06.670> creatures<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:08.170> some

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
think of modern sama creatures well some

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.559 
think of modern sama creatures well some
of<00:02:08.500> them<00:02:08.739> are<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.160> extreme<00:02:09.729> bought<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.239> some

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
of them are so extreme bought and some

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.080 
of them are so extreme bought and some
of<00:02:10.720> my<00:02:10.750> creatures<00:02:11.140> are<00:02:11.650> somewhat<00:02:12.489> extreme

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
of my creatures are somewhat extreme

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.530 
of my creatures are somewhat extreme
today<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:14.260> tried<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.709> make<00:02:14.920> ours<00:02:15.190> logical<00:02:16.090> up

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
today we tried to make ours logical up

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.350 
today we tried to make ours logical up
to<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> point<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:19.299> can<00:02:19.569> fancy<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.360> when

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
to a point that you can fancy but when

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.420 
to a point that you can fancy but when
they<00:02:22.540> get<00:02:22.750> too<00:02:22.989> extreme<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.560> think<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.220> lose

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
they get too extreme I think you lose

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.460 
they get too extreme I think you lose
your<00:02:24.760> audience<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:26.560> they<00:02:26.590> they<00:02:27.580> are<00:02:28.470> used

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470

imagination<00:05:06.849> so<00:05:07.849> I<00:05:07.879> think<00:05:08.179> they're<00:05:08.689> they're

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
imagination so I think they're they're

very vile Greek mythology has a great

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.409 
very vile Greek mythology has a great
deal<00:05:14.809> to<00:05:15.169> it<00:05:15.349> more<00:05:15.649> than<00:05:15.889> meets<00:05:16.549> the<00:05:16.729> eye<00:05:16.849> and

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
deal to it more than meets the eye and

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.619 
deal to it more than meets the eye and
we<00:05:18.169> try<00:05:18.469> to<00:05:18.499> inject<00:05:19.159> that<00:05:19.629> type<00:05:20.629> of

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
we try to inject that type of

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.119 
we try to inject that type of
interpretation<00:05:23.629> to<00:05:23.989> our<00:05:24.139> Greek<00:05:24.439> mythology

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
interpretation to our Greek mythology

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.369 
interpretation to our Greek mythology
and<00:05:25.989> we<00:05:26.989> even<00:05:27.189> resorted<00:05:28.189> to<00:05:28.839> science<00:05:29.839> fiction

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
and we even resorted to science fiction

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.049 
and we even resorted to science fiction

with the artist vs of modern sausage I

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.909 
with the artist vs of modern sausage I
worked<00:05:35.059> very<00:05:35.389> closely<00:05:35.479> with<00:05:36.110> groups<00:05:36.679> the

electricity is but it sounds good and

knowing<00:06:11.680> I<00:06:12.009> think<00:06:12.250> one<00:06:12.550> scene<00:06:12.910> where<00:06:13.539> we

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
knowing I think one scene where we

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.330 
knowing I think one scene where we
