00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.170
 this is my shop that is miso good 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.660

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.059
 before they considered it medicinal what 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.390
 happens that the fermentation of soy 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.430
 It helps a lot to the intestinal flora 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.010
 then imagine how good it is for 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.550
 all of us already know that in vietnam 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.160

 It is also not difficult to find 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.700

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.040
