him now we're gonna be jumping on the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.039 
him now we're gonna be jumping on the
Titan<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> increased<00:01:09.720> height

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
Titan here and this is increased height

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.219 
Titan here and this is increased height
lift<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> there's<00:01:11.820> only<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.360> mean<00:01:12.570> Titan<00:01:13.080> has

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

lift and there's only I mean Titan has
the<00:01:13.290> same<00:01:13.470> jump<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.890> either<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> really

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the same jump on either one so it really

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
the same jump on either one so it really
doesn't<00:01:14.880> matter<00:01:15.030> whatever<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.229> points<00:01:16.439> are

the<00:01:17.369> only<00:01:17.580> defender<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.420> 13<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.670> just<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the only defender or 13 down just of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
the only defender or 13 down just of
havoc<00:01:21.420> everywhere<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> cleared<00:01:22.650> Marinko

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
havoc everywhere and it cleared Marinko

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
havoc everywhere and it cleared Marinko
we're<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> same<00:01:24.360> exact<00:01:24.720> thing

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
gonna go take that same under the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.130 
gonna go take that same under the
approach<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.390> guys<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.049> my

approach and so right now guys on my

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.960 
approach and so right now guys on my
stream<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.619> am<00:01:31.649> running<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.460> people<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
stream I am running this for people and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420 
stream I am running this for people and
so<00:01:33.149> this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.140> far<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> easiest<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.220> do

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so this is by far the easiest way to do

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.580 
so this is by far the easiest way to do
bridge<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.180> guy<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.570> over<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.440> can

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
bridge have one guy go over you can

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.840 
bridge have one guy go over you can
easily<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:38.039> this<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.640> matter<00:01:38.759> of
