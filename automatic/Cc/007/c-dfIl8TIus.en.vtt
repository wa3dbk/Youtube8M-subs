00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.600
 well let's perform the sum of these 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.790
 two quotients where they have a 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.099
 denominator different the fact that 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.959
 have a different denominator wants 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.690
 say that we're going to have to use a 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.420
 alternative method to that of a normal sum 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.640
 between conscious that they have the same 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.810
 denominator well for this case what 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.270
 we can do is use the term that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.490
 be closer to these two numbers such 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.900
 that by multiplying them we get to some 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.749
 term that both can be their musicians 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.690
 in this case if I get to 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:41.559
 multiply 5 by 3 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.039
 I would give 15 likewise if I 'm 3 what 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.229
 multiplied by 5 I would give 15 but not 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.829
 let's do that really what we're going 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:54.219
 to do is to use what is known 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.320
 as cross products in this case 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.770
 let's imagine that I have 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.780
 letters instead of numbers we have to 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.180
 about b more I know about b is exactly what 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.160
 same but for this case and for not 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.170
 estimate what in this part of here I what 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.930
 what I am going to do is a multiplication 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.810
 in such a way that I will have the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.380
 terms 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.220
 and they come multiplied which in turn go to 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.430
 have a plus sign below that is 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.310
 they will be affected by py porsche 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.260
 such that in the numerator part 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 I would have aa 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:43.650
 x law and this one that will multiply 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.570
 b x looks for c that's what I would have 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.369
 in the numerator part now in the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.049
 part of the denominator that is what I'm going 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.649
 to contain I will contain the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.920
 multiplication of green in such a way 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.460
 that would have b by d this is what we're going 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.130
 to use to be able to make this sum 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.500
 between two terms that do not have the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.479
 same denominator then if you perform 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.850
 exactly what I just said wants 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.020
 say that I'm going to multiply the 2 by the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.860
 3 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.020
 products crossed two by three and I'm going 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.060
 to put in the part of number two and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.040
 then here I have the plus sign that sign 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.030
 I put it and I will have the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.970
 multiplication of 5 by 8 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.960
 5 x 8 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.760
 and also in the part of the so-called 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.220
 what I'm going to do is multiply the two 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.880
 denominators in such a way that it would have 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.880
 5 by 3 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.350
 5 parts well there I have it then I 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.580
 here I have this and I finished the only thing that 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.460
 lack is to perform operations 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.830
 corresponding but properly the 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.570
 method to be able to make the sum of 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.780
 fractions that do not contain the same 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.090
 called already done well then 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.000
 this is going to be the same as what he did 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.800
 multiplications two times three is six 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.520
 plus five by eight that are 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.590
 mind that's going to be divided by 5 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.140
 for 3 that are 15 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.010
 although it does the sum that I have in the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.110
 part of the number and I have 6 more 40 46 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.860
 on 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.819
 15 that means that the sum 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.709
 two-fifths 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:36.499
 plus eight thirds will be equal to 46 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.409
 between 15 if I wanted to simplify what 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:42.560
 what I need to find are such terms 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.510
 that can be divisible both in the 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.359
 part of the numerator as in the part of the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.030
 denominator in the numerator part I 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.120
 I can divide between 2 such that would give me 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.980
 23 but in the denominator part I 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.950
 I can not divide by 2 because it does not give me 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.769
 a whole term then now we're going to 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.889
 see if I can divide by 3 in the part 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.519
 of the numerator I can not divide between 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.069
 3 because he does not give me a whole number but 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.419
 in the denominator part if I can that 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.579
 it means that I can not either 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.980
 perform then you can no longer 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.250
 further simplify this expression of such 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.199
 so that way we leave it then this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.740
 means that the sum between these two 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.320
 terms gives us as a result 46 between 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.320
 15 using what is known as 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.790
 cross products for a sum between 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.710
 terms that contain different 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.180
 I hope this example was of 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.230
 help and if you have questions please 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.230
 comment thank you
