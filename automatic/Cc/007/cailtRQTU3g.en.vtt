 work the dough if not just the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.819
 egg whites that have just been 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.469

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.329
 and we will not have the texture of 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.289
 sponge cake here it's ready friends what 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.479
 you're going to do it's simply 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.270
 spread the genoa on the paper enough to 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.399
 business we see the cook at 180 degrees 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.950
 in a preheated oven for about 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.049
 11 minutes and after we will cut 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.880
 shapes in it so these are the 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.159
 tonsils genoise and then you now 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.840
 using a cookie cutter or at worst 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.409
 if you do not like to setbacks we're going 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.870
 come size and shape of the pimms 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.520
 only after detailed cookies 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.030
 we're going to come but jam is here 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.220
 the result 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.140
 try to put how they have 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.450
 small rim on the side and now 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.330
 we will melt the chocolate 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.520
 white in the microwave and then we go 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
 simply cover the cookies 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.240
 of chocolate if you ever have a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 jam that is liquid I you 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 advise to spend your disc during 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.760
 an hour in the fridge 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.070
 the story that the age of the east is well 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.020
 hard for me not because I have 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.460
 already which is thick enough so there 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.480
 it's simple we do not come over 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.740

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.110

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.750
 thick and especially look at who is 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.040
