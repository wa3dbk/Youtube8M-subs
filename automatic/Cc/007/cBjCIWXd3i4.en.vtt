it because as you can see by this one
right<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.430> doesn't<00:00:32.759> work<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.090> certain

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
right here it doesn't work in certain

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
right here it doesn't work in certain
places<00:00:33.540> yes<00:00:34.079> yeah<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.829> one's<00:00:35.040> obviously<00:00:35.280> not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
places yes yeah this one's obviously not

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
places yes yeah this one's obviously not
working<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.690> shrub<00:00:36.960> doesn't<00:00:37.350> look<00:00:37.469> too

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
working and the shrub doesn't look too

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
working and the shrub doesn't look too
happy<00:00:38.010> either<00:00:38.300> Sheri<00:00:39.300> we've<00:00:39.510> been<00:00:39.660> walking

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
happy either Sheri we've been walking

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
happy either Sheri we've been walking
for<00:00:40.290> two<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.590> three<00:00:40.770> hundred<00:00:40.829> feet<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
for two or three hundred feet here and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
for two or three hundred feet here and
have<00:00:41.760> them<00:00:41.879> come<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.510> supply<00:00:43.350> point<00:00:43.739> yet

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
have them come to the supply point yet

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.250 
have them come to the supply point yet
where<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.930> over<00:00:46.140> here

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
where where is that it's over here

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.389 
where where is that it's over here
behind<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.710> building<00:00:47.039> I'll<00:00:47.160> show<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
behind the other building I'll show you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.389 
behind the other building I'll show you
okay<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.200> think<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.530> thing<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
okay I think the first thing to do is to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.100 
okay I think the first thing to do is to
check<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.879> pressure<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.780> where<00:00:51.989> your

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
check the pressure right here where your

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.860 
check the pressure right here where your
supply<00:00:52.500> system<00:00:52.949> comes<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:54.480> splitter

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
supply system comes into your splitter

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
supply system comes into your splitter
could<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.500> hold<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> black<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
could you hold that black one out of the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
could you hold that black one out of the
way<00:00:56.850> sure<00:00:57.420> I've<00:00:58.230> got<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.500> handy<00:00:58.859> dandy<00:00:59.039> pressure

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
way sure I've got a handy dandy pressure

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
way sure I've got a handy dandy pressure
gauge<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
gauge here to do that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
gauge here to do that
right<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.100> bought<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.210> in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
right you get that I bought this one in

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.729 
right you get that I bought this one in
an<00:01:03.420> irrigation<00:01:03.690> supply<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> can

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
an irrigation supply but you can

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109 
an irrigation supply but you can
probably<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> home

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
probably get one like it at a home

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.080 
probably get one like it at a home
center<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.750> ten<00:01:07.409> dollars<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.130> what's<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
center for ten dollars or so what's that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640 
center for ten dollars or so what's that
going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> tell<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.630> well<00:01:09.930> we're<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.350> throw

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
going to tell you well we're gonna throw

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920 
going to tell you well we're gonna throw
this<00:01:10.860> little<00:01:11.100> gauge<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.210> looks

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
this little gauge and there we go looks

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.190 
this little gauge and there we go looks
like<00:01:13.020> we've<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.530> well<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:14.939> fifty<00:01:15.270> pounds<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
like we've got well over fifty pounds is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
like we've got well over fifty pounds is
that<00:01:16.350> good<00:01:16.560> yeah<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.430> plenty<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.000> run<00:01:18.210> an

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that good yeah that's plenty to run an

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
that good yeah that's plenty to run an
ordinary<00:01:18.810> drip<00:01:19.049> system<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.460> that's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
ordinary drip system so what that's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
ordinary drip system so what that's
telling<00:01:20.759> us<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.780> problem<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.350> down<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
telling us is the problem is down the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
telling us is the problem is down the
line<00:01:23.040> from<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.810> about

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
line from here and what do you do about

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
line from here and what do you do about
that<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.650> I've<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.100> another<00:01:26.540> pressure

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that well I've got another pressure

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
that well I've got another pressure
gauge<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> use<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.220> connect<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.790> here

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
gauge which I can use to connect in here

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.319 
gauge which I can use to connect in here
at<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.479> emitter<00:01:31.200> connection<00:01:31.770> points

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
at one of your emitter connection points

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.480 
at one of your emitter connection points
now<00:01:33.329> what's<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> tell<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.490> same

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
now what's that going to tell you same

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.710 
now what's that going to tell you same
thing<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> tell<00:01:36.270> us<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.600> much

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
thing it's going to tell us how much

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
thing it's going to tell us how much
pressure<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.350> flowing<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> line<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pressure is flowing down the line to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.749 
pressure is flowing down the line to
each<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.360> emitter<00:01:39.600> point<00:01:39.960> oh<00:01:42.079> yeah<00:01:43.759> what's

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
each it emitter point oh yeah what's

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
each it emitter point oh yeah what's
that<00:01:44.820> mean<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.720> looks<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.079> me<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.740> we've

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that mean it looks to me like what we've

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.940 
that mean it looks to me like what we've
got<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.590> insufficient<00:01:49.590> amount<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
got here is a insufficient amount of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
got here is a insufficient amount of
water<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.399> fill<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.670> line<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.479> completely

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
water to fill the line and completely

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.469 
water to fill the line and completely
pressurize<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> pressure<00:01:54.090> at

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
pressurize it so that the pressure at

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.530 
pressurize it so that the pressure at
each<00:01:54.659> individual<00:01:55.290> emitter<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.969> not<00:01:56.969> enough<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
each individual emitter is not enough to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.929 
each individual emitter is not enough to
operate<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.229> properly<00:01:58.610> what<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> want<00:01:59.880> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
operate it properly what do you want to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.450 
operate it properly what do you want to
do<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:01.070> well<00:02:02.070> there's<00:02:02.310> two

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
do about that well there's two

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510 
do about that well there's two
possibilities<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:04.590> could<00:02:04.770> change<00:02:05.219> out

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
possibilities one is we could change out

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.910 
possibilities one is we could change out
all<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.240> emitters<00:02:06.750> you've<00:02:07.469> got<00:02:07.740> an

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
all of the emitters you've got an

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.460 
all of the emitters you've got an
emitter<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.479> type<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> puts<00:02:10.319> out

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
emitter here of this type that puts out

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.460 
emitter here of this type that puts out
maybe<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:11.069> much<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.520> 10<00:02:11.760> gallons<00:02:12.209> an<00:02:12.330> hour

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
maybe as much as 10 gallons an hour

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
maybe as much as 10 gallons an hour
there's<00:02:14.040> emitters<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.270> have

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
there's emitters like this one I have

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.290 
there's emitters like this one I have
here<00:02:16.110> which<00:02:16.680> puts<00:02:16.950> out<00:02:17.130> only<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:17.850> gallon<00:02:18.270> per

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
here which puts out only one gallon per

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.810 
here which puts out only one gallon per
hour<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.900> quicker<00:02:19.230> solution<00:02:19.470> would<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.580> try

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
hour a quicker solution would be to try

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.090 
hour a quicker solution would be to try
dividing<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> system<00:02:21.960> into<00:02:22.200> two<00:02:22.230> parts<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
dividing the system into two parts and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.610 
dividing the system into two parts and
are<00:02:23.640> immediately<00:02:24.210> cutting<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> demand<00:02:25.350> in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
are immediately cutting the demand in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800 
are immediately cutting the demand in
half<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.280> seeing<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.030> don't<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.510> enough

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
half and seeing if we don't have enough

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.530 
half and seeing if we don't have enough
input<00:02:28.050> pressure<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:29.100> run<00:02:29.310> each<00:02:29.610> half<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
input pressure to run each half of the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.540 
input pressure to run each half of the
system<00:02:30.960> separately<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.980> sounds<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:32.460> you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
system separately that sounds good you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.950 
system separately that sounds good you
want<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> try<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.060> yeah<00:02:33.420> let's<00:02:33.660> try<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
want to try that yeah let's try that

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.490 
want to try that yeah let's try that
okay

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
okay

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.310 
okay
let's<00:02:34.680> give<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.040> try<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.580> think<00:02:36.570> when<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.050> clip

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
let's give it a try I think when we clip

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.040 
let's give it a try I think when we clip
this<00:02:37.530> line<00:02:37.800> here<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.340> shorten<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:39.270> will<00:02:39.510> be

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
this line here and shorten it we will be

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.720 
this line here and shorten it we will be
able<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.320> test<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.770> theory<00:02:43.490> I'm<00:02:44.490> going<00:02:44.670> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
able to test that theory I'm going to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.150 
able to test that theory I'm going to
use<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.170> sealing<00:02:46.170> off<00:02:46.290> device<00:02:46.710> called<00:02:47.040> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
use this sealing off device called a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.660 
use this sealing off device called a
figure<00:02:47.460> eight<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:49.980> slide<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.460> onto

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
figure eight and you just slide it onto

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.260 
figure eight and you just slide it onto
the<00:02:50.850> tube<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.290> that's<00:02:52.530> going<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.770> work<00:02:53.060> yep

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
the tube and that's going to work yep

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.320 
the tube and that's going to work yep
if<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> turn<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.890> water<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.330> we'll

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
if you want to turn the water on we'll

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.220 
if you want to turn the water on we'll
prove<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.650> do<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.540> Roger<00:03:00.840> while

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
prove it I can do that and Roger while

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.500 
prove it I can do that and Roger while
she's<00:03:01.500> doing<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.830> why<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.550> check<00:03:03.360> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
she's doing that why don't we check to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.850 
she's doing that why don't we check to
get<00:03:03.630> ready<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.960> check<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.320> pressure<00:03:04.530> all

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
get ready to check the pressure all

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.560 
get ready to check the pressure all
right<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.040> brought<00:03:05.160> your<00:03:05.550> pressure<00:03:06.030> tech<00:03:06.300> gauge

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
right I brought your pressure tech gauge

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.060 
right I brought your pressure tech gauge
down<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:07.110> gonna<00:03:07.230> do<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> did

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
down I'm gonna do just what you did

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.820 
down I'm gonna do just what you did
before<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.460> pulled<00:03:08.850> out<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> emitter<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
before you pulled out the emitter and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.150 
before you pulled out the emitter and
just<00:03:10.830> slid<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.460> in<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:13.020> now<00:03:13.350> as<00:03:13.710> soon<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:14.040> she

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
just slid it in and now as soon as she

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.560 
just slid it in and now as soon as she
turns<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.640> water<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.270> should<00:03:15.300> get<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
turns on the water we should get a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.530 
turns on the water we should get a
reading<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.050> gauge<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.590> think<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
reading on the gauge I think so and I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.880 
reading on the gauge I think so and I
think<00:03:18.660> it'll<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.170> number<00:03:19.440> we're<00:03:19.590> looking

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
think it'll be the number we're looking

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.030 
think it'll be the number we're looking
for<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.340> sure<00:03:20.700> hope<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:22.580> here<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.700> comes<00:03:23.880> guys

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
for I sure hope so here it comes guys

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.910 
for I sure hope so here it comes guys
no<00:03:26.040> there<00:03:26.190> we<00:03:26.280> go<00:03:26.430> there<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.910> ten<00:03:27.270> fifteen

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
no there we go there it is ten fifteen

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.410 
no there we go there it is ten fifteen
gosh<00:03:28.920> almost<00:03:29.310> twenty<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:29.910> twenty<00:03:30.270> that's

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
gosh almost twenty was twenty that's

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.510 
gosh almost twenty was twenty that's
what<00:03:30.570> we're<00:03:30.660> looking<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.980> look<00:03:32.280> at<00:03:32.370> this

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
what we're looking for and look at this

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.380 
what we're looking for and look at this
Oh<00:03:34.010> perfect<00:03:35.010> good<00:03:35.340> flow<00:03:35.580> all<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.850> way<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
Oh perfect good flow all the way to the
