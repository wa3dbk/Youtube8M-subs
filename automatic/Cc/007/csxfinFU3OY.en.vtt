basically<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:04.890> two<00:01:05.159> ways<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.909> make<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
basically there are two ways to make a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050

thing is you freeze it until like 50

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.899 
thing is you freeze it until like 50
percent<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.740> fish<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.189> is
