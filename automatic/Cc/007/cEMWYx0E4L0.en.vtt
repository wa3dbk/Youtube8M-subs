00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:36.460
 flash file sion script 2.0 accept 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.010
 something like this will open up for us 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.110
 you can add a background what you 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.360
 want ok ok in the first layer 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.230
 let's call her and what's her name 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 ground floor what we call him 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.820
 I acquired here but we will create all the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.090
 soil is good we choose the tool 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 of rectangle or whatever you want 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.190
 I choose this easier 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.080
 well we do something like that and I'll choose another 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.200
 green color 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.280
 I delete these lines that you have here 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 name is called soil ok in accepting this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.730
 now we create a new layer 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.730
 that this stage will be called character 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.010

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.610
 ok since I have it we are going to add the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.970
 next code that is going to be this I will 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.470
 I'm going to leave the video script 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.750

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.500
 we tighten control more center 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.190

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.950
 that's why I gave the error we give on 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.930
 ground 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.770
 window 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.800
 properties but 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.040
 here where it says instance name we're going to 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.790
 put soil 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.120
 and here characters we are going to point out the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.680
 Character properties properties or just 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.040
 tightening control more

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.799
 where exactly where does it say let's put 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.810
 t character 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.120
 and let's go 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.120
 As you can see, it moves 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.230
 moves for the sides 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.440
 right left right left 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.240
 jump 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.210
 and if we know the soil 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:46.349
 we die well well this is a
