00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 geffray 10 companies did that 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 we are specialized in the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 protection and luggage of the motorcycle 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 on these two topics we import 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 the products is precarious for 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.670
 all of france who are 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 German products 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 here allow us to equip a name 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970
 very very important 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.670
 motorcycles the oldest motorcycles the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.250
 most recent wholesale we treat a 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 range of about 800 mo 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.780
 we took as an example today the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 varadero 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 he 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.210
 the top fixing system 16 is 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.010
 extremely simple since we have 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.199
 from a platinum to the rear m like the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.910
 wars which is a platinum that gets 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.500
 fix them systematically on 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.270
 the back of the bike on the fraquet port 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.400
 of the bike and on which we are going 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.840
 find a hoop here on the front of 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 platinum so why all 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.509
 simply because the top-case has 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.030
 in the back of a small of a small 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.320
 overthickness here that comes slipping 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 in a totally natural way under itself 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 submit to those we come next 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.700
 blocked the top 15 with the lock on 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.030
 locks an offer almost perfectly 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.220
 perfectly he knows on the bike all 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.890
 the top box of the rest m kobe caire 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.450
 similarly fix the varadero 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.479
 has like many motorcycles 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.940
 besides supports is like and 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.649
 care which are side supports 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.950
 specific for each of the motorcycles at 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.869
 level of their editing then we have a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.369
 uniformity in the fastenings of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.560
 suitcases read that all the suitcases and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.049
 precarious seconds on all media 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.740
 and kobe caire and extremely 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.649
 simple 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.040
 we actually have the front of the valley that goes 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.500
 slip under the front part of 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.810
 support and the arena will close all 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640
 simply with this system is closed 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.220
 Becker is extremely simple since 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.530
 can put his suitcases he removed his 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.610
 suitcases in seconds a way 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.380
 quite natural since 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.800
 this lock on the back we 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.120
 unlocks it then suffices us 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.540
 to remove the bag as simply 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.490
 of the world 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.180
 coop city and we end up with 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.550
 support brackets one can possibly 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.460
 debunk if we do not have the utility of 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.350
 supports a daily way his 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.760
 suitcases features optional pogner 's 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.930
 support actually on wrists 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.670
 brave simply these are 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.459
 straps that simply allow 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.050
 to take his bags the art of power 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.570
 in the evening go quietly to the hotel 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.720
 without any problem there is an interest 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.550
 important to his suitcases in kobe caire 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 it's the ability to put a 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.870
 full face helmet because we will see a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.000
 mediately since integral helmet that 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.770
 I have to go back simply 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.459
 the suitcase without the slightest is really 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.340
 in trouble 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.350
 good it's an asset it's an interest and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.870
 it is true that it is in great demand by 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.620
 our customers who really need to 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.620
 it 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.300
 and 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.300
 and 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.990
 and 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.020
 we have equipped this thousand varadero 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.840
 with fears carter site in varadero 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.410
 thousand of 2005 the carter baffles having a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.410
 utility 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.940
 we know very well in terms of 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.100
 motorcycle protection in terms of 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.620
 motorcycle side protection in case of 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.900
 juicy drop that are often the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.290
 most of the time when stopped or low 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.090
 speed 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.550
 so that's by carter are caught in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.620
 many times at the level of the bike so 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.960
 a point at the cadres level on the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.060
 back part frozen by carter so on 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.150
 the front part of the engine and we just got 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.740
 then resume at different points 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.980
 behind the fairing 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.420
 in fact what allows in the bike 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.560
 to have a water protection from his 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.570
 important fairing as far as sounded 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.940
 by cartels are positioned would say 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.500
 substantially halfway between the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.380
 lower part of the engine and the part 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.110
 high of the bike so it's a part 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.480
 central that helps protect also 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.750
 well the lower part of the bike that the 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.750
 part 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.770
 but
