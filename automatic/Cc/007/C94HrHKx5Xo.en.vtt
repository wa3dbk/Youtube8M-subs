00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
here over sea flag and is it a map

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.609 
here over sea flag and is it a map
exploit<00:00:25.060> or<00:00:25.330> not<00:00:25.810> I'm<00:00:26.140> not<00:00:26.320> quite<00:00:26.590> sure

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
exploit or not I'm not quite sure

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.529 
exploit or not I'm not quite sure
although<00:00:27.550> there<00:00:27.910> are<00:00:28.030> some<00:00:28.240> things<00:00:28.449> that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
although there are some things that

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.930 
although there are some things that
actually<00:00:28.900> don't<00:00:29.410> function<00:00:29.830> as<00:00:30.039> intended<00:00:30.430> but

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
actually don't function as intended but

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.459 
actually don't function as intended but
we're<00:00:31.090> gonna<00:00:31.180> get<00:00:31.390> into<00:00:31.690> that<00:00:31.720> here<00:00:32.109> and<00:00:32.319> a

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
we're gonna get into that here and a

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.500 
we're gonna get into that here and a
little<00:00:32.739> bit<00:00:32.890> here<00:00:33.219> so<00:00:33.399> let's<00:00:34.120> cut<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.420> the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
little bit here so let's cut to the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.759 
little bit here so let's cut to the
footage<00:00:34.839> and<00:00:35.019> see<00:00:35.079> what<00:00:35.289> it<00:00:35.409> takes<00:00:35.620> to

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
footage and see what it takes to

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.709 
footage and see what it takes to
actually<00:00:35.920> get<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.579> balcony<00:00:36.760> alright<00:00:37.539> so<00:00:37.690> I

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
actually get to the balcony alright so I

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.360 
actually get to the balcony alright so I
decided<00:00:38.109> to<00:00:38.170> head<00:00:38.350> up<00:00:38.469> these<00:00:38.589> stairs<00:00:39.039> here

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
decided to head up these stairs here

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.979 
decided to head up these stairs here
because<00:00:39.640> obviously<00:00:39.879> you<00:00:40.449> need<00:00:40.659> to<00:00:40.780> head<00:00:40.870> up

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
because obviously you need to head up

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.509 
because obviously you need to head up
the<00:00:41.109> stairs<00:00:41.350> in<00:00:41.530> order<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.859> make<00:00:42.010> some<00:00:42.249> sort<00:00:42.429> of

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
the stairs in order to make some sort of

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.939 
the stairs in order to make some sort of
jump<00:00:42.879> not<00:00:43.420> exactly<00:00:43.780> sure<00:00:44.050> at<00:00:44.170> this<00:00:44.260> point<00:00:44.379> what

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
jump not exactly sure at this point what

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.770 
jump not exactly sure at this point what
its<00:00:45.100> gonna<00:00:45.190> take<00:00:45.579> here<00:00:45.850> but<00:00:46.389> you'll<00:00:46.510> notice

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.180 
its gonna take here but you'll notice
here<00:00:46.929> right<00:00:47.170> as<00:00:47.319> I<00:00:47.350> get<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.739> top<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
here right as I get to the top of the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.160 
here right as I get to the top of the
stairs<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.699> see<00:00:48.969> this<00:00:49.120> guy<00:00:49.300> standing<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.870> ledge

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
that is a clear indicator to me that it

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.020 
that is a clear indicator to me that it
takes<00:00:52.479> a<00:00:52.719> skilled<00:00:52.780> jump<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:54.219> kind<00:00:54.429> of<00:00:54.489> line<00:00:54.789> it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
takes a skilled jump to kind of line it

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.759 
takes a skilled jump to kind of line it
up<00:00:55.179> and<00:00:55.389> jump<00:00:55.780> there<00:00:55.929> however<00:00:56.319> if<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.559> just

balcony<00:01:10.810> just<00:01:11.020> kind<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.590> proving<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:11.979> you

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
balcony just kind of proving that you

balcony just kind of proving that you
can<00:01:12.369> get<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.759> lower<00:01:12.969> balcony<00:01:13.360> as<00:01:13.750> well

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
can get to the lower balcony as well

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.620 
can get to the lower balcony as well
alright<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:15.820> now<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:16.000> we're<00:01:16.240> on<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.359> balcony

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
alright so now that we're on a balcony

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.539 
alright so now that we're on a balcony
this<00:01:17.020> does<00:01:17.320> actually<00:01:17.770> open<00:01:18.039> up<00:01:18.130> some<00:01:18.340> pretty

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
this does actually open up some pretty

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.179 
this does actually open up some pretty
good<00:01:18.640> angles<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.990> doorways<00:01:20.380> leading<00:01:20.770> into

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
good angles of the doorways leading into

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.099 
good angles of the doorways leading into
the<00:01:21.310> sea<00:01:21.549> flag<00:01:21.820> here<00:01:22.119> actually<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.930> lower

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
the sea flag here actually the lower

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.289 
the sea flag here actually the lower
balcony<00:01:23.380> might<00:01:24.039> almost<00:01:24.310> be<00:01:24.640> better<00:01:24.850> than<00:01:25.149> the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
balcony might almost be better than the

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.330 
balcony might almost be better than the
upper<00:01:25.600> balcony<00:01:25.780> but<00:01:26.289> that's<00:01:26.560> another<00:01:27.100> thing

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
upper balcony but that's another thing

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.010 
upper balcony but that's another thing
to<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.609> decided<00:01:27.729> whether<00:01:28.359> or<00:01:28.509> not<00:01:28.600> it's<00:01:28.899> gonna

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
to be decided whether or not it's gonna

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.440 
to be decided whether or not it's gonna
be<00:01:29.079> sticking<00:01:29.439> around<00:01:29.579> anyhow<00:01:30.579> there<00:01:31.210> right

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
be sticking around anyhow there right

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
to this balcony let's kind of touch on

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.680 
to this balcony let's kind of touch on
that<00:03:08.160> topic<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:09.030> whether<00:03:09.239> or<00:03:09.360> not<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.660> should

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
that topic of whether or not it should

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.780 
that topic of whether or not it should
be<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> game<00:03:10.530> now<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:10.920> me<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.459> couple<00:03:11.700> of

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
be in the game now for me a couple of

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.910 
be in the game now for me a couple of
things<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.150> do<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.709> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
things I do like I do like that it is a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.190 
things I do like I do like that it is a
nice<00:03:14.459> defensible<00:03:15.180> position<00:03:15.750> you're<00:03:15.959> really

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
nice defensible position you're really

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.780 
nice defensible position you're really
not<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.799> have<00:03:16.920> any<00:03:17.160> offensive

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
not going to have any offensive

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.060 
not going to have any offensive
abilities<00:03:18.239> from<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.959> spot<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.920> I've

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
abilities from this spot and as I've

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.470 
abilities from this spot and as I've
tested<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.640> game<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.940> really<00:03:21.090> don't

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
tested in the game you really don't

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.509 
tested in the game you really don't
necessarily<00:03:22.049> get<00:03:22.170> more<00:03:22.680> points<00:03:22.950> being<00:03:23.310> up

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
necessarily get more points being up

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.910 
necessarily get more points being up
here<00:03:23.760> as<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.120> would<00:03:24.239> do<00:03:24.420> opposed<00:03:24.930> being<00:03:25.290> down

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
here as you would do opposed being down

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.870 
here as you would do opposed being down
somewhere<00:03:26.280> where<00:03:26.430> you're<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.579> little<00:03:26.790> bit

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
somewhere where you're a little bit

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880 
somewhere where you're a little bit
closer<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> action<00:03:27.989> however<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.860> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
closer to the action however it is a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.100 
closer to the action however it is a
good<00:03:29.190> place<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.430> kind<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> back<00:03:30.120> up<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.540> defend

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
good place to kind of back up and defend

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.990 
good place to kind of back up and defend
the<00:03:31.230> C<00:03:31.410> flag<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.040> lot<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.310> people<00:03:32.579> are<00:03:32.760> going

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the C flag if a lot of people are going

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.390 
the C flag if a lot of people are going
to<00:03:33.090> be<00:03:33.299> rushing<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
to be rushing in so I like that it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.180 
to be rushing in so I like that it
exists<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.540> case<00:03:37.079> however<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.040> one

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
exists for that case however the one

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.590 
exists for that case however the one
thing<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.549> don't<00:03:38.610> really<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.090> about<00:03:39.269> this

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
thing I don't really like about this

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.259 
thing I don't really like about this
position<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.320> railing<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.430> feel<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.120> if

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
position is that railing I feel like if

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.729 
position is that railing I feel like if
it's<00:03:42.420> gonna<00:03:42.570> be<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> railing<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.350> can<00:03:43.500> see

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
it's gonna be a railing that you can see

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.140 
it's gonna be a railing that you can see
through<00:03:43.950> then<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.400> should<00:03:44.579> be<00:03:44.730> able<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> be

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
through then it should be able to be

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.759 
through then it should be able to be
shot<00:03:45.420> through<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.170> leads<00:03:46.350> me<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.560> believe

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
shot through so that leads me to believe

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.830 
shot through so that leads me to believe
that<00:03:46.950> at<00:03:47.310> least<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.730> railing<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.329> one<00:03:48.630> thing

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
that at least the railing is one thing

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.460 
that at least the railing is one thing
that<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.110> definite

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
that is definite

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.710 
that is definite
broken<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:49.980> possibly<00:03:50.520> should<00:03:50.820> be<00:03:50.970> fixed<00:03:51.450> now

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
broken and possibly should be fixed now

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.970 
broken and possibly should be fixed now
whether<00:03:51.960> or<00:03:52.080> not<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.380> railing<00:03:52.620> should<00:03:52.890> be

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
whether or not this railing should be

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.680 
whether or not this railing should be
more<00:03:53.220> accessible<00:03:53.550> let's<00:03:53.940> say<00:03:54.120> maybe<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.450> door

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
more accessible let's say maybe a door

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.360 
more accessible let's say maybe a door
that<00:03:54.840> opens<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.590> stairways<00:03:55.980> up<00:03:56.160> there

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
that opens up to the stairways up there

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.950 
that opens up to the stairways up there
I<00:03:56.550> don't<00:03:56.640> really<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.660> it

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
I don't really think so I like that it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.110 
I don't really think so I like that it
takes<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.500> bit<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.710> skill<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.550> kind<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.030> a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
takes a bit of skill and kind of a

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.180 
takes a bit of skill and kind of a
well-timed<00:04:00.720> jump<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.380> end<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.680> where<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.160> are

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
well-timed jump to end up where you are

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.560 
well-timed jump to end up where you are
not<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.910> mention<00:04:03.060> when<00:04:03.300> you're<00:04:03.390> actually

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
not to mention when you're actually

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.940 
not to mention when you're actually
assaulting<00:04:04.320> this<00:04:04.440> flag

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
assaulting this flag

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.740 
assaulting this flag
you<00:04:05.220> really<00:04:05.460> can't<00:04:05.670> jump<00:04:05.940> up<00:04:06.090> here<00:04:06.330> into<00:04:06.570> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you really can't jump up here into the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.330 
you really can't jump up here into the
balcony<00:04:06.930> without<00:04:07.440> somebody<00:04:07.710> seeing<00:04:08.100> you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
balcony without somebody seeing you

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.100 
balcony without somebody seeing you
first<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.030> stairway<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.810> kind<00:04:10.020> of

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
first in the stairway so it kind of

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.420 
first in the stairway so it kind of
protects<00:04:10.590> itself<00:04:10.860> from<00:04:11.100> becoming

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
protects itself from becoming

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.610 
protects itself from becoming
overpowered<00:04:12.270> because<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.870> takes<00:04:13.080> so<00:04:13.230> long<00:04:13.410> to

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
overpowered because it takes so long to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.230 
overpowered because it takes so long to
get<00:04:13.740> you<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.190> that's<00:04:14.370> where<00:04:14.580> I'm<00:04:14.670> at<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:15.060> this

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
get you so that's where I'm at with this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.670 
get you so that's where I'm at with this
I<00:04:15.390> don't<00:04:15.570> really<00:04:15.660> feel<00:04:15.960> like<00:04:16.019> it's<00:04:16.320> complete

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
I don't really feel like it's complete

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.410 
I don't really feel like it's complete
exploit<00:04:17.220> although<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> do<00:04:17.760> feel<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
exploit although I do feel like the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.020 
exploit although I do feel like the
railing<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.900> absolutely<00:04:19.500> broken<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.790> feel

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
railing is absolutely broken and I feel

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.009 
railing is absolutely broken and I feel
like<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.390> should<00:04:21.570> be<00:04:21.660> something<00:04:21.870> that

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
like that should be something that

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.470 
like that should be something that
should<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.410> fixed<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:23.100> if<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.640> are<00:04:23.880> kind<00:04:24.330> of

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
should be fixed so if you are kind of

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.090 
should be fixed so if you are kind of
trying<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.810> attack<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.320> flag<00:04:25.500> here<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.950> they

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
trying to attack the flag here and they

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100 
trying to attack the flag here and they
have<00:04:26.280> defense<00:04:27.030> set<00:04:27.300> up<00:04:27.390> here<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.960> balcony

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
have defense set up here in the balcony

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.770 
have defense set up here in the balcony
you<00:04:28.500> can<00:04:28.650> take<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.980> player<00:04:29.220> out<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:30.240> all<00:04:30.570> in

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
you can take that player out but all in

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.450 
you can take that player out but all in
all<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:31.140> don't<00:04:31.380> feel<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:31.740> it's<00:04:31.920> too<00:04:32.100> big<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.310> an

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
all I don't feel like it's too big of an

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.100

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
exploit and it's definitely not as bad

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.010 
exploit and it's definitely not as bad
as<00:04:34.680> them<00:04:34.980> m320<00:04:35.700> grenade<00:04:35.880> launchers<00:04:36.630> those
