00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.509
 good friends of hdblog important phone 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.309
 important recovery lgg 3 more than most 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.219
 important extended recovery that is 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.440
 turning this this classic video 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 fountain light condition is very much 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 difficult because we have a lot of candle 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.230
 bright and a fairly dark street 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 see if I move as it changes 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 the show that change would say 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.510
 correctly the exposure we try to 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.689
 zoom in on a skyscraper la 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.939
 bottom up, full hd footage 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.540
 this lg treaty of stabilizer 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 optical image this is the zoom 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.520
 maximum 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.790
 let's try to pan fast from now 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.610
 this part they did and now I try 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.040
 to zoom in on these doors 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 garibaldi in milan leaves a written e 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.120
 this is the zoom on the writing us 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.840
 see how it behaves 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.440
 image stabilizer and then 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.410
 usual walk seen from the display not 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 it doesn't seem bad to me 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:05.090
 nothing walking a little hard the door 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.090
 recovered 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.409
 I came out with a feline leap to keep 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.140
 open the door and here in the dark there 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.500
 boxes in the dark we say that it is not there 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.070
 lots of light in the entrance hall but still 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.030
 less there will be inside the elevator 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 obviously this path does it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 just to test all the various 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 conditions of brightness of fire in the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 various phones and I'm lucky g state 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.189
 re not changing these bulbs that less 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.840
 allow me to review the quality 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:48.229
 in the dark of g3 he is now recovering 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.670
 these are written the button panel ours 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.109
 g3 Korean version 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.090
 however we say that the hardware is 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.850
 exactly the same as the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.890
 version that will be released here in Europe from among 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.750
 some days should come out first 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.729
 g3 elites July we wait have faith 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.660
 the doors will be opened soon 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.030
 invaded by so much light and we will understand 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.410
 as if doing well with adaptation to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.880
 lights this g3 ok we have doors ready 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.450
 open 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.860
 here is this is a nice roof 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.980
 backlight 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.260
 now let's do a commissioning test 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.120
 focus of a near point and a point 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.310
 far away even if against the sun does not come 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.700
 just fine for hdblog andrea 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.700
