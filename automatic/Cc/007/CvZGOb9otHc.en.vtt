00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
can be drawing depending on how it's
formulated<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.329> that's<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.629> something<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
formulated so that's just something to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.290 
formulated so that's just something to
keep<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.289> mind<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.800> does<00:00:52.860> um<00:00:53.430> foam<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.120> or

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
keep in mind this does um foam up or

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.170 
keep in mind this does um foam up or
lather<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.230> any<00:00:55.440> traditional<00:00:56.180> shampoo

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

lather just like any traditional shampoo
I<00:00:57.480> find<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> very<00:00:58.289> drying<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.340> use<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I find it very drying if I even use it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
I find it very drying if I even use it
once<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.030> week<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> would<00:01:00.780> keep<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.170> mind<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
once a week so I would keep in mind that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
once a week so I would keep in mind that
if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.430> dry<00:01:02.579> hair<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.539> curly

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
if you have really dry hair as curly

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.410 
if you have really dry hair as curly
hair<00:01:04.199> tends<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:05.159> characterized<00:01:05.820> by<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
hair tends to be characterized by I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.170

would<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> stay<00:01:07.740> away<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.909> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
would kind of stay away from it like I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.530 
would kind of stay away from it like I
would<00:01:09.390> probably<00:01:09.540> use<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> maybe<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
would probably use this maybe as a

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.700 
would probably use this maybe as a
clarifying<00:01:12.540> shampoo<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.350> feel<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
clarifying shampoo because I feel it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
clarifying shampoo because I feel it
does<00:01:14.010> take<00:01:14.760> away<00:01:15.030> quite<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> lot<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> buildup

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
does take away quite a lot of buildup

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
does take away quite a lot of buildup
it's<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.009> enjoyed<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> conditioner

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it's I really enjoyed the conditioner

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
it's I really enjoyed the conditioner
they<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.540> both<00:01:18.659> smell<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> same<00:01:19.229> they

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
they don't they both smell the same they

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
they don't they both smell the same they
have<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> shea<00:01:20.040> butter<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.610> slightly

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
have like that shea butter but slightly

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.039 
have like that shea butter but slightly
fruity<00:01:21.299> scent<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> them

fruity scent to them

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
fruity scent to them
I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.710> left<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.369> hair<00:01:23.610> very

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
I think this left my hair very

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.440 
I think this left my hair very
moisturized<00:01:24.600> however<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.320> found<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
moisturized however I found that I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.700 
moisturized however I found that I
sometimes<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.600> unable<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.049> leave<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.530> my

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sometimes I'm unable to leave it on my

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
sometimes I'm unable to leave it on my
hair<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.009> long<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.310> possible<00:01:29.460> with

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
hair as long as possible with

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
hair as long as possible with
conditioner<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> obviously<00:01:31.140> leave

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
conditioner you want to obviously leave

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.749 
conditioner you want to obviously leave
it<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.710> hair<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.220> long<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.610> possible

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it in your hair as long as possible

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
it in your hair as long as possible
because<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.570> gives<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> sink<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because it gives it more time to sink in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
because it gives it more time to sink in
and<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.100> better<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.549> hair<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and it's better for your hair because I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
and it's better for your hair because I
don't<00:01:36.930> always<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> time<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
run a little bit of water like kind of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.679 
run a little bit of water like kind of
towards<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> ends<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
towards the ends just a little bit of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
towards the ends just a little bit of
dampness<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.979> area<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:50.670> I'll

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
dampness in that area and then I'll

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.609 
dampness in that area and then I'll
apply<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.090> conditioner<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.200> let<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> sit

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
apply some conditioner and let it sit

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.190 
apply some conditioner and let it sit
there<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.130> half<00:01:53.340> hour<00:01:53.520> before<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.570> into

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there like in half hour before I go into

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
there like in half hour before I go into
the<00:01:55.439> shower<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.100> way<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:56.909> helps

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the shower so that way it really helps

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.480 
the shower so that way it really helps
every<00:01:57.869> once<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.259> shower<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
every once I'm in the shower I use the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.590 
every once I'm in the shower I use the
shampoo<00:01:59.790> conditioner<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.509> normally

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
shampoo conditioner like I normally

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.510 
shampoo conditioner like I normally
would<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.890> conditioner<00:02:02.250> had<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
would because the conditioner had a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
would because the conditioner had a
little<00:02:02.700> bit<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> extra<00:02:03.180> time<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.689> hair<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
little bit of extra time in the hair it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.899 
little bit of extra time in the hair it
really<00:02:04.380> makes<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.009> lot<00:02:05.040> more<00:02:05.189> softer<00:02:05.759> than

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
really makes it a lot more softer than

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.730 
really makes it a lot more softer than
if<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.420> use<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> shower<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
if I just use it in the shower so I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.109 
if I just use it in the shower so I
didn't<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.429> conditioner<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
didn't really like this conditioner I

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.850 
didn't really like this conditioner I
will<00:02:09.420> put<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.959> my<00:02:10.050> other<00:02:10.259> favorites

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
will put some of my other favorites

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.160 
will put some of my other favorites
because<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.849> is

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
because I don't think this is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.670 
because I don't think this is
like<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.730> must<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.940> type<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.750> product<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
like I must have type of product and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.320 
like I must have type of product and
this<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:15.980> great<00:02:16.400> if<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.730> don't<00:02:16.880> want<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.180> use

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
this is great if you don't want to use

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.030 
this is great if you don't want to use
like<00:02:17.540> super<00:02:17.930> expensive<00:02:18.140> products<00:02:18.800> every

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
like super expensive products every

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.680 
like super expensive products every
single<00:02:19.069> time<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.640> wash<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.239> cleanse<00:02:20.450> your

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
single time you wash and cleanse your

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.290 
single time you wash and cleanse your
hair<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.200> would<00:02:21.800> pick<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.340> up<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.849> always<00:02:23.150> do

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
hair I would pick this up I always do

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.729 
hair I would pick this up I always do
that<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.690> switch<00:02:23.930> off<00:02:24.140> between<00:02:24.319> really

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
that like I switch off between really

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.710 
that like I switch off between really
expensive<00:02:24.980> products<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:26.060> little<00:02:26.480> bit<00:02:26.569> more

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
expensive products and a little bit more

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
expensive products and a little bit more
affordable<00:02:27.140> products<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.770> way<00:02:27.950> I'm<00:02:28.160> not

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
affordable products so that way I'm not

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.640 
affordable products so that way I'm not
using<00:02:28.940> little<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:29.720> good<00:02:29.930> stuff<00:02:30.170> every

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
using little really good stuff every

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.699 
using little really good stuff every
single<00:02:30.680> time<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.660> makes<00:02:32.660> sense<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> would

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
single time that makes sense so I would

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.430 
single time that makes sense so I would
skip<00:02:33.920> out<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.550> can<00:02:34.880> tune<00:02:35.239> shea<00:02:35.989> butter<00:02:36.230> or

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
skip out on the can tune shea butter or

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380 
skip out on the can tune shea butter or

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
for the conditioner and I really like

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.559 
for the conditioner and I really like
this<00:02:40.370> conditioner<00:02:40.910> when<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> use<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.330> in

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
this conditioner when I use it in

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.080 
this conditioner when I use it in
conjunction<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.590> lush<00:02:42.920> curly<00:02:43.760> wurly

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
conjunction with the lush curly wurly

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.090 
conjunction with the lush curly wurly
shampoo<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.840> might<00:02:45.080> buy<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.920> do<00:02:46.069> a

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
shampoo which I might buy so I can do a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.009 
shampoo which I might buy so I can do a
full<00:02:46.370> review<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.120> absolutely<00:02:47.450> love<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
combination of both of them I think it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.390 
combination of both of them I think it
leaves<00:02:50.030> my<00:02:50.209> curls<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.600> lot<00:02:50.870> more<00:02:51.350> defined<00:02:51.920> but
