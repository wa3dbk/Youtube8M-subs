00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.379
 the park theater is currently in 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.030
 Eindhoven converted into a film set 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.250
 a scene is recorded in the theater 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.530
 between the protagonists theo maassen 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.790
 and you learned of ash treasure or manslaughter 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.710
 is a vibrator 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.910
 in which an ambulance brother played 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.400
 by theo maassen 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.080
 social behavior 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.760
 so the whole film is special 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.470
 in Eindhoven 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.000
 we film 20 days and we think every 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.599
 day another place so one 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.910
 at least 20 real large locations 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.260
 me but there are many more to it 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.570
 but we are there we two three locations 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.780
 we are really tired of it 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.940
 whole center and strijp-s and we are sitting 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.199
 show a lot of the city 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.299
 what is also nice is that a lot of beautiful ones 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.489
 places in Eindhoven well on film 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:51.129
 we are immortalized in the philips village 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.129
 have turned in the street where 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.440
 so that PCs loom behind at home and 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.600
 behind the roof in very nice alleys 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.150
 we renovated that for me now 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.309
 just in time because after a little more 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.650
 creepy is just right for the movie 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.570
 so that is very nice yes also about the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.790
 Eindhoven extras and Eindhoven 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.050
 the film crew is enthusiastic 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.030
 there is not so much rotation here 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.440
 People like that you like the movie 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.880
 comes to make 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.800
 that is a huge difference because if you 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.690
 a person in Amsterdam or Rotterdam 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.070
 is going to do turning 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.080
 yeah that 's kind of this derma here 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.970
 the people just really nice that you come 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.230
 film and that shows enthusiasm 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.750
 from us but also from the people 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.000
 where we are running and that that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.390
 is really a fairly unique experience 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.970
 to tell 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.640
 50 extras had to come in the morning 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.980
 I heard that the attendance rate is 100% 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 was that one has never experienced 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.390
 yes it was very nice yesterday 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.400
 People who sit for 10 hours figure 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.800
 and at the end it is still true 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.409
 fresh and fun and funny and with laughter 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.510
 and so that is half here for here 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.909
 to vibrate from the floor 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.740
 homicide is from January 5 next year 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 to be seen in the Dutch weather shovel
