watertight the lens is flush now and and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
watertight the lens is flush now and and
the<00:00:59.699> unfortunately<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> microphone<00:01:01.230> has

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the unfortunately the microphone has

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.110 
the unfortunately the microphone has
been<00:01:01.469> bulked<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> quality<00:01:02.609> isn't<00:01:02.910> as

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
been bulked up so the quality isn't as

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
been bulked up so the quality isn't as
good<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> other<00:01:03.600> cameras<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.589> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
good as the other cameras and it's not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.500 
good as the other cameras and it's not
great<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> box<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.850> make<00:01:06.030> sure<00:01:06.060> if

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
great out of the box but make sure if

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.390 
great out of the box but make sure if
you<00:01:06.630> install<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> firmware<00:01:07.290> update<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.220> does

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you install the firmware update it does

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130 
you install the firmware update it does
get<00:01:08.640> better<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.119> still<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
get better but I still don't think it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.359 
get better but I still don't think it's
as<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> other<00:01:10.979> contour

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
as good as some of the other contour

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
as good as some of the other contour

it<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.250> labeled<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.939> worry<00:02:06.030> about<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it is labeled so don't worry about that

it is labeled so don't worry about that
too<00:02:06.600> much<00:02:08.030> now<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> size<00:02:10.229> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
too much now because the size is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
know deeper than one meter which is what

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.570 
know deeper than one meter which is what
this<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.840> rated<00:02:20.050> for<00:02:20.410> look<00:02:21.100> at<00:02:21.220> getting<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.550> of

this is rated for look at getting one of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.270 
this is rated for look at getting one of
the<00:02:21.700> other<00:02:21.850> cameras<00:02:22.210> with<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> waterproof<00:02:22.840> case

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the other cameras with a waterproof case

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.060 
the other cameras with a waterproof case
and<00:02:24.280> also<00:02:24.610> because<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.450> trail<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.650> mounting

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
and also because the trail the mounting

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.570 
and also because the trail the mounting
system<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:28.450> slightly<00:02:29.220> different<00:02:30.220> in

system here is slightly different in

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.730 
system here is slightly different in

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
that the the width between here is

that the the width between here is
slightly<00:02:33.010> different<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.880> doesn't<00:02:34.120> work<00:02:34.360> in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
slightly different it doesn't work in

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.940 
slightly different it doesn't work in
the<00:02:34.600> windshield<00:02:35.080> mount<00:02:35.320> because<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.710> bolt

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the windshield mount because the bolt

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.140 
the windshield mount because the bolt
doesn't<00:02:36.220> reach<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.990> casing<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.700> yeah<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:40.060> I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
doesn't reach the casing and yeah like I

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.110 
doesn't reach the casing and yeah like I
said<00:02:40.300> doesn't<00:02:40.510> fit<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.900> any<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:42.120> other

something like 135 degrees so looks a

something like 135 degrees so looks a

something that contour always done

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.570 
something that contour always done
it's<00:03:29.140> like<00:03:29.350> disappointing<00:03:30.100> along<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:30.489> the

it's like disappointing along with the

it's like disappointing along with the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
lack of 60 frames per second but you can

note here the contour cameras which have

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.509 
note here the contour cameras which have
been<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.060> 2<00:03:52.390> 2<00:03:52.930> dot<00:03:53.200> predator<00:03:53.890> sort<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.250> star

been a 2 2 dot predator sort of star
system<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.690> think<00:03:56.350> those<00:03:56.470> lasers<00:03:56.799> were<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.040> bit

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
system I think those lasers were a bit

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.360 
system I think those lasers were a bit
more<00:03:57.640> powerful<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.180> lot<00:03:58.570> easier<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.560> use<00:04:00.160> for<00:04:00.190> a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
more powerful a lot easier to use for a

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.310 
more powerful a lot easier to use for a
longer<00:04:00.610> distances<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.480> don't<00:04:01.930> think<00:04:02.140> this<00:04:02.260> is

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
longer distances I don't think this is

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.560 
longer distances I don't think this is
quite<00:04:02.500> as<00:04:02.980> easy<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.310> use<00:04:03.430> if<00:04:03.850> what<00:04:04.360> you're

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
quite as easy to use if what you're

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.030 
quite as easy to use if what you're
trying<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.959> point<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.320> out<00:04:05.410> is<00:04:05.560> further<00:04:05.830> away

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
trying to point it out is further away

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.160 
trying to point it out is further away
but<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.790> certainly<00:04:07.269> think<00:04:07.420> it's<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.780> lot<00:04:08.019> better

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
but I certainly think it's a lot better

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.130 
but I certainly think it's a lot better
than<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.500> derp<00:04:08.640> trying<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.970> make<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.780> image

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
than a derp trying to make the image

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.610 
than a derp trying to make the image
more<00:04:12.360> level<00:04:13.360> it's<00:04:13.930> definitely<00:04:14.260> easier<00:04:14.560> if

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
more level it's definitely easier if

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.469 
more level it's definitely easier if
what<00:04:14.980> you're<00:04:15.100> pointing<00:04:15.220> at<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.610> closer<00:04:15.910> and

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
what you're pointing at is closer and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.900 
what you're pointing at is closer and
all<00:04:17.019> in<00:04:17.260> all<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.650> think<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.950> contour<00:04:18.400> roam<00:04:18.609> is<00:04:18.880> a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
all in all I think the contour roam is a

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.630 
all in all I think the contour roam is a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
great camera fits in really nicely and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.420 
great camera fits in really nicely and
along<00:04:22.060> with<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.919> auto<00:04:24.130> exposure

quite some time now and it saved me a

quite some time now and it saved me a

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
lot of time in working out with settings

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.240 
lot of time in working out with settings
I<00:04:41.830> need<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:43.090> keeps<00:04:43.390> my<00:04:43.570> video<00:04:43.960> quality

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
I need and it keeps my video quality

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.070 
I need and it keeps my video quality
constantly<00:04:45.250> high<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.090> can't<00:04:46.840> recommend

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
constantly high so I can't recommend

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.370 
constantly high so I can't recommend
this<00:04:47.470> camera<00:04:47.710> highly<00:04:48.130> enough<00:04:48.450> but<00:04:49.450> if<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.990> 60

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
this camera highly enough but if the 60

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.529 
this camera highly enough but if the 60
frames<00:04:50.590> per<00:04:50.650> second<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.250> internal<00:04:52.150> battery

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
frames per second and internal battery

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.960 
frames per second and internal battery
is<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.780> big<00:04:53.560> downer<00:04:53.890> for<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.340> then<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:54.910> know

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
is a big downer for you then you know

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.330 
is a big downer for you then you know
you've<00:04:55.120> got<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.360> other<00:04:55.479> 1080p<00:04:56.349> which<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.220> can

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
you've got the other 1080p which you can

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.490 
you've got the other 1080p which you can
get<00:04:57.430> for<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.640> bargain<00:04:58.090> price<00:04:58.510> now<00:04:58.900> because<00:04:59.140> this

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
get for a bargain price now because this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.490 
get for a bargain price now because this
is<00:04:59.680> essentially<00:05:00.160> replacing<00:05:00.789> it<00:05:00.930> or<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.260> GPS

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
is essentially replacing it or the GPS

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.909 
is essentially replacing it or the GPS
camera<00:05:03.039> both<00:05:03.430> really<00:05:03.970> good<00:05:04.090> cameras<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.740> yeah

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
camera both really good cameras so yeah

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.650 
camera both really good cameras so yeah
I<00:05:05.950> think<00:05:06.099> you<00:05:06.520> know<00:05:06.669> great<00:05:07.030> addition<00:05:07.360> by

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
I think you know great addition by

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.960 
I think you know great addition by
contour<00:05:08.140> and<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.410> hope<00:05:08.800> they<00:05:08.950> take<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.400> things

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
contour and I hope they take on things

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.790 
contour and I hope they take on things
like<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.270> quarter-inch<00:05:10.810> mount<00:05:11.229> across<00:05:11.620> some

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
like the quarter-inch mount across some

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.710 
like the quarter-inch mount across some
of<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.010> other<00:05:12.340> other<00:05:13.180> cameras<00:05:13.570> because

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
of the other other cameras because

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.370 
of the other other cameras because
certainly<00:05:14.229> is<00:05:14.410> very<00:05:15.160> very<00:05:15.490> wanted<00:05:16.229> if<00:05:17.229> you

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
certainly is very very wanted if you

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.110 
certainly is very very wanted if you
don't<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:17.650> some<00:05:17.860> sample<00:05:18.400> videos<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
don't see some sample videos of the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.060 
don't see some sample videos of the
contour<00:05:19.900> roam<00:05:20.110> in<00:05:20.289> action<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.770> can<00:05:20.919> just

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
contour roam in action you can just

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.680 
contour roam in action you can just
check<00:05:21.370> out<00:05:21.550> some<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.880> other<00:05:22.000> videos<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.660> my
