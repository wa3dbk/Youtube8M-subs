controllers<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:29.880> reviewed<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.359> before

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
controllers now I've reviewed one before

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
controllers now I've reviewed one before
it's<00:00:30.990> very<00:00:31.140> similar<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> cool<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.710> expect<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's very similar to cool they expect a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
it's very similar to cool they expect a
drop<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> charge<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.480> uses<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> similar

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
drop and charge which uses a similar

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.170 
drop and charge which uses a similar
wireless<00:00:34.680> thing<00:00:35.219> except<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.700> its<00:00:36.000> not

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
wireless thing except for its not

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
wireless thing except for its not
actually<00:00:36.660> magnetic<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.530> doesn't<00:00:37.770> stick<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
actually magnetic so it doesn't stick to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.650 
actually magnetic so it doesn't stick to
the<00:00:38.760> controller<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.480> they're

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the controller which you'll see they're

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.940 
the controller which you'll see they're
very<00:00:39.690> similar<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.469> go<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.620> sticked<00:00:40.890> on

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
very similar there we go it sticked on

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
very similar there we go it sticked on
there<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.640> you'll<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> review<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.510> I

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
there if you'll see the review of this I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.910 
there if you'll see the review of this I
did<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.899> last<00:00:43.079> J<00:00:43.290> click<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> annotation

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
did this last J click on the annotation

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
did this last J click on the annotation
at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> top<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> screen<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:45.329> check

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
at the top the screen right now go check

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
at the top the screen right now go check
that<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.379> available<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that out as well that's available at a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
that out as well that's available at a
different<00:00:47.309> price<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.450> doesn't<00:00:48.570> come

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
different price and also it doesn't come

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.270 
different price and also it doesn't come
with<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.230> reach<00:00:49.440> idle<00:00:49.710> backtracks<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> only

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
with to reach idle backtracks it only

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.630 
with to reach idle backtracks it only
comes<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.750> back<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> orb<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
comes with one back to the orb so the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.680 
comes with one back to the orb so the
advantages<00:00:53.640> about<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.420> it's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
advantages about this is that it's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
advantages about this is that it's
wireless<00:00:55.170> charging<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.890> literally<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> can

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
wireless charging so literally you can

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
wireless charging so literally you can
just<00:00:56.969> play<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.600> while<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.289> drop

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
just play it for a while and then drop

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
just play it for a while and then drop
it<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.820> about<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> will

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it down and you can get about it it will

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.849 
it down and you can get about it it will
charge<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> light<00:01:01.590> there

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
charge you can see what I light there

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.319 
charge you can see what I light there
but<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.129> charging<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.910> red<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
but it's charging when it's red and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
but it's charging when it's red and
that's<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.369> simple

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that's it it's really really simple

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
that's it it's really really simple
I<00:01:05.939> mean<00:01:06.450> obviously<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.110> downside<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
I mean obviously the downside of this is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
I mean obviously the downside of this is
that<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> can't<00:01:09.090> play<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.540> charge<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.900> same

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that you can't play in charge at same

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
that you can't play in charge at same
time<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> forget<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> put<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.520> here

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
time so if you forget to put it on here

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
time so if you forget to put it on here
and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.090> play<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.299> new<00:01:12.600> battery<00:01:12.990> dies

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and then you play the new battery dies

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200 
and then you play the new battery dies
you<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> put<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> back<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
you then have to put it back on to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
you then have to put it back on to
charge<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.689> which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
charge it which is you know a bit of a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
charge it which is you know a bit of a
pain<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> doesn't<00:01:18.600> mean<00:01:18.659> less<00:01:18.840> time

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
pain but it doesn't mean less time

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.240 
pain but it doesn't mean less time
fiddling<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> wire<00:01:19.710> settlement<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
fiddling with a wire settlement and I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
fiddling with a wire settlement and I
really<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.000> wireless<00:01:21.330> charging<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
really think that wireless charging is a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.649 
really think that wireless charging is a
lot<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.530> fun<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> easy<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.240> said<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> comes

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
lot more fun and easy as I said it comes

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
lot more fun and easy as I said it comes
with<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:24.990> batteries<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.830> straight

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
with two batteries so you can straight

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
with two batteries so you can straight
away<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.729> two<00:01:26.850> controllers<00:01:27.270> whereas

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
away get it into two controllers whereas

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
away get it into two controllers whereas
the<00:01:27.960> expect<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> many<00:01:28.680> others<00:01:28.950> only<00:01:29.070> come

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the expect and many others only come

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
the expect and many others only come
with<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.150> you'd<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> buy<00:01:30.630> an

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
with one so you'd have to buy an

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.270 
with one so you'd have to buy an
additional<00:01:30.840> battery<00:01:31.470> pack<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.220> is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
additional battery pack with it this is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
additional battery pack with it this is
about<00:01:32.460> 424<00:01:33.090> pounds<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.659> way<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:34.049> gaming

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
about 424 pounds by the way from gaming

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
about 424 pounds by the way from gaming

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
below if you want to go check it out

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
below if you want to go check it out
more<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.590> violent<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> really

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
more or violent really good I really

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.460 
more or violent really good I really
recommend<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> especially<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.229> these<00:01:40.320> two

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
recommend it especially with these two

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
recommend it especially with these two
batteries<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.340> means<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> whole

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
batteries it means you know the whole

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.990 
batteries it means you know the whole
package<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.520> light<00:01:44.520> you'll<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
package is in one light you'll see in

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.190 
package is in one light you'll see in
the<00:01:45.060> middle<00:01:45.119> show<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.479> its<00:01:45.600> charge<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.049> it's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the middle show in its charge so it's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.929 
the middle show in its charge so it's
blue<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.860> they're<00:01:47.040> already<00:01:47.159> charged<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
blue when they're already charged as you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.700 
blue when they're already charged as you
can<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.750> they're<00:01:48.869> not<00:01:49.020> charged<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> goes

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
can see when they're not charged it goes

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
can see when they're not charged it goes
red<00:01:49.950> obviously<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.610> take<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
red obviously when you take them off the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
red obviously when you take them off the
light<00:01:51.509> goes<00:01:51.689> off<00:01:51.899> which<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:52.950> really

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
light goes off which is really really

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.940 
light goes off which is really really
nice<00:01:53.520> really<00:01:53.850> simple<00:01:54.290> now<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.439> charged<00:01:55.860> if

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
nice really simple now it's charged if

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
nice really simple now it's charged if
you<00:01:56.040> didn't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.310> via<00:01:56.520> USB<00:01:57.000> though<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.110> only

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you didn't know via USB though it only

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
you didn't know via USB though it only
comes<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.100> USB<00:01:59.490> cable<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.329> you'd<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
comes with a USB cable so you'd have to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.880 
comes with a USB cable so you'd have to
plug<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.930> into<00:02:01.020> either<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.320> computer<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
plug it into either a computer or a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.270 
plug it into either a computer or a
laptop<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:03.450> doesn't<00:02:03.780> come<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.590> USB

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
laptop it doesn't come with like a USB

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.039 
laptop it doesn't come with like a USB
to<00:02:05.490> power<00:02:05.700> adapter<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> plug<00:02:06.750> into<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
to power adapter at all to plug into the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.900 
to power adapter at all to plug into the
wall<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.649> shame<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
wall which is a shame because I like to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
wall which is a shame because I like to
have<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.270> next<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.569> source<00:02:09.899> 360<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
have it right next to my source 360 and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.350 
have it right next to my source 360 and
I<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> use<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.489> USB<00:02:11.790> ports<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
I don't want to use the USB ports of the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.250 
I don't want to use the USB ports of the
360

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
360

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.660 
360
but<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.799> might<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:13.980> different<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.519> that's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
but you might be different so that's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.630 
but you might be different so that's
right<00:02:14.900> obviously<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.430> being

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
right obviously to be with it being

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.509 
right obviously to be with it being
magnetic<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.720> snaps<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.230> batteries<00:02:19.590> into

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
magnetic it snaps the batteries into

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.800 
magnetic it snaps the batteries into
place<00:02:20.760> whether<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> controller<00:02:21.689> or

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
place whether it's on the controller or

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.720 
place whether it's on the controller or
not<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.379> charge<00:02:22.709> them<00:02:22.920> without<00:02:23.280> actually

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
not you can charge them without actually

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.059 
not you can charge them without actually
being<00:02:23.909> on<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.450> controller<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.439> just<00:02:25.950> think

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
being on the controller I just think

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.100 
being on the controller I just think
it's<00:02:26.189> easier<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.489> have<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.819> way<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.930> can

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
it's easier to have it this way you can

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830 
it's easier to have it this way you can
feel<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.500> magnetic<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.280> pull<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.000> you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
feel the magnetic you know pull and you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.300 
feel the magnetic you know pull and you
know<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.200> sort<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.470> keeps<00:02:31.709> them<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.159> you<00:02:32.220> go

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
know it sort of keeps them on if you go

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.500 
know it sort of keeps them on if you go
I<00:02:32.340> mean<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.879> it<00:02:32.970> keeps<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.420> on

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
I mean you can see it keeps it on

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.539 
I mean you can see it keeps it on
whereas<00:02:34.079> with<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.379> drop<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.560> charge<00:02:34.860> it

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
whereas with the drop in charge it

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.660 
whereas with the drop in charge it
doesn't<00:02:35.909> you<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.209> rest<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.569> perfectly<00:02:37.670> so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
doesn't you have to rest on perfectly so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
doesn't you have to rest on perfectly so
yeah<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.180> nice<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.659> they<00:02:39.720> don't<00:02:39.900> slip

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
yeah so that's nice and they don't slip

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.470 
yeah so that's nice and they don't slip
off<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:41.459> only<00:02:41.609> other<00:02:41.760> disadvantage<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.329> can

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
off the only other disadvantage I can

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.000 
off the only other disadvantage I can
really<00:02:42.689> find<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:43.170> your<00:02:43.200> magnetic<00:02:43.739> induction

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
really find with your magnetic induction

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.360 
really find with your magnetic induction
charging<00:02:44.569> thing<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.859> bit<00:02:47.010> plain

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
charging thing is that it's a bit plain

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.819 
charging thing is that it's a bit plain
don't<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.269> see<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.739> as

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
don't you see it it's it's not really as

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.129 
don't you see it it's it's not really as
white<00:02:50.099> as<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.389> box<00:02:51.629> it's<00:02:51.900> very

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
white as it is on the box it's very

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.599 
white as it is on the box it's very
