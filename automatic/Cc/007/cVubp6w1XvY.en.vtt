00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
understand that the subprocess you have

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290 
understand that the subprocess you have
to<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.770> through<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to go through to get that and if you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
to go through to get that and if you
delay<00:00:36.690> starting<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.500> process<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.309> delay

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
delay starting that process or you delay

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.540 
delay starting that process or you delay
during<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.840> process<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.309> come

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
during that process because things come

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.310 
during that process because things come
up<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.910> life<00:00:42.120> does<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> can't<00:00:42.960> keep<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
up as life does and you can't keep on

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
up as life does and you can't keep on
your<00:00:43.500> schedule<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:44.340> you're<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> push

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
your schedule then you're going to push

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
your schedule then you're going to push
that<00:00:44.969> date<00:00:45.390> further<00:00:45.750> back<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> always<00:00:46.950> make

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that date further back so always make

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.150 
that date further back so always make
sure<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.940> allow<00:00:48.239> yourself<00:00:48.420> extra

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
sure that you allow yourself extra

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
sure that you allow yourself extra
leeway<00:00:50.160> extra<00:00:50.879> practice<00:00:51.390> time<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.719> do<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
leeway extra practice time to do it so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
leeway extra practice time to do it so
let's<00:00:52.590> say<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.980> target<00:00:53.399> date<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.610> six<00:00:54.270> months

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
let's say your target date is six months

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.660 
let's say your target date is six months
from<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.899> year<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
from now a year from now then you get a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.479 
from now a year from now then you get a
calendar<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.440> mark<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
calendar out and you mark on the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.150 
calendar out and you mark on the
calendar<00:00:59.969> mother<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> daughter<00:01:01.289> father<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
calendar mother and daughter father and

collision-free driving so remember what
are<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.630> talking<00:01:45.960> about<00:01:46.020> setting<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> target

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

are we talking about setting a target
date<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.570> working<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.320> from<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
date and then working back from that

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
date and then working back from that
date<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.369> make<00:01:50.579> sure<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.149> all

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
date to make sure that you have all

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.080 
date to make sure that you have all
times<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.899> flexible<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.640> approach

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
times and be flexible if as you approach

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.899 
times and be flexible if as you approach
that<00:01:54.360> date<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.020> realize<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:56.009> just

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that date you realize you know I just

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.490 
that date you realize you know I just
I'm<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.299> quite<00:01:57.570> ready<00:01:57.600> yet<00:01:57.899> well<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:58.290> move

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I'm not quite ready yet well then move

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.740 
I'm not quite ready yet well then move
the<00:01:58.680> date<00:01:58.860> back<00:01:59.130> okay<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.270> set<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.600> stone

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
