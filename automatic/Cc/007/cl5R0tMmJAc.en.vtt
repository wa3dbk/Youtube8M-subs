00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hello everyone today on my review 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.920
 thermos japanese company for jo gun 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 a very famous company probably 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.440
 world market bears a few words about 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 the company than she so especially she began 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.289
 Production vacuum thermos flask 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.850
 forty eighth year from '81 she started 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 produce thermos 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 with a steel vacuum flask and for more 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.670
 than 200 five year history of this 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.739
 production 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.309
 she sharpened this art almost to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.040
 ideal 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.230
 that is, the gap in the vacuum steel flask 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.460
 is only one millimeter what 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020
 makes the thermos compact and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.110
 specifically the model that I purchased 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.980
 somewhere around 5 months ago this 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.610
 one and a half liter thermos and what is interesting 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.680
 and all the company thermos for jo gun and their 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.410
 no feature there are such models 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.199
 more days eat less than me 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.729
 one and a half, the first feature I said 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.430
 this is a compact flask 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.090
 and very effective at the same time like me 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.479
 checked 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.380
 its effectiveness of self kill and 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.990
 I entered it was the beginning of the beginning or 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.729
 mid-October poured into a thermos and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.130
 left overnight on the balcony in the balcony 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.550
 that time was night was cool 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 about two degrees + in the morning 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.720
 pulled out a thermos and is busy in the kitchen 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 accordingly, I was about 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.750
 23 degrees opened a thermos from there went 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.720
 by 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.730
 I did not measure the temperature with my finger 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.390
 tried it was very hot 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.150
 so the effectiveness of me is extremely and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.320
 first stood on the street actually 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:57.350
 about 8 hours and it was very 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.470
 hot water is another feature 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.080
 companies for earplugs and and thermos and 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.590
 is the inner heat to cover then 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.959
 there is a flask the rest on the dust he them 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.050
 pleasant to the touch and seemingly plastic 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.440
 which supposedly doesn't keep that smell 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.870
 coffee tea and drinks and food worth succeeded 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 it really is up to smell there but 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.040
 they are significantly 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.019
 pronounced than this happens the rest 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 Thermos this already compared on his experience 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:35.489
 design thermos see it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.769
 mean strap who well who need whom 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.150
 convenient when the circles carry fishing rods 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:45.920
 can always hang on the shoulder and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.760
 convenient to carry it handle to hold 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.829
 pour well and see what 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.159
 the inside is very comfortable 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.159
 design 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.790
 joining cups and jams 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.500
 that is, the thread is fixed in 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.200
 certain position you never 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.849
 twist do not twist and click it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.659
 always fixed in one position 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.150
 Turn off, too, a nice bonus 2 cups 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.239
 you and your partner fishing on the hunt 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.290
 you can always two by one print in 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:27.280
 the other is very convenient and compact 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.739
 valve design valve is also like me 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.840
 say like a cup you do not put it 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.840
 in no other position except 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:42.129
 you need to pour tea no when 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:47.140
 it conveniently opens by simply pressing 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:49.750
 buttons also closes another plus 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.420
 constructions data is something 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.730
 let's say you forgot to close the thermos 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.200
 you pecked fish flew duck opened 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.110

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.890
 while being with this cup closes this 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.069
 valve is very simple very convenient david 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.620
 cup if you forget thrown and and flavor 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.620
 It will always have closed it well 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.760
 one more indisputable convenience of the valve 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.850
 is that completely collapsible 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.100
 side button you yearn to disassemble it 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.050
 2 parts are removed even gaskets all 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.320
 very easy, you can again Kiev point and 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.760
 assemble in one motion all valve assembly 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.760
 he is in working condition 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:43.210
 and of course Teflon coating and 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.810
 the convenience of a wide neck can be quietly 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.400
 climb up 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.990
 wash the thermos inside and it will be clean 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.770
 the thermos weighs a little 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.120
 I highly recommend everyone 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.540
