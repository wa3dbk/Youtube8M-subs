Irons as Lex Luthor I love that dude
he's<00:05:30.530> beast<00:05:30.770> all<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.160> casting<00:05:31.700> has<00:05:31.850> been<00:05:32.060> so

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
he's beast all the casting has been so

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.390 
he's beast all the casting has been so
strange<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:33.170> say<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.530> least<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:34.130> maybe

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
strange to say the least that maybe

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.830 
strange to say the least that maybe
there<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.730> a<00:05:34.760> pattern<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.480> it<00:05:35.630> they're

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
there is a pattern to it they're

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.570 
there is a pattern to it they're
obviously<00:05:36.350> going<00:05:36.710> off<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.040> rails<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:37.430> the

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
obviously going off the rails so the

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.000 
obviously going off the rails so the
entire<00:05:38.000> movie<00:05:38.570> will<00:05:38.750> be<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.200> obscure<00:05:39.710> that<00:05:39.920> it

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
entire movie will be so obscure that it

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.100 
entire movie will be so obscure that it
all<00:05:40.220> fits<00:05:40.250> together<00:05:40.790> in<00:05:41.090> an<00:05:41.360> obscure<00:05:41.840> world

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
all fits together in an obscure world

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.500 
all fits together in an obscure world
and<00:05:42.380> does<00:05:42.560> work<00:05:42.890> in<00:05:43.100> its<00:05:43.250> obscure<00:05:43.700> way<00:05:43.910> or<00:05:44.270> it's

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
and does work in its obscure way or it's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.030 
and does work in its obscure way or it's
all<00:05:44.660> just<00:05:44.870> going<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.230> be<00:05:45.320> terrible<00:05:45.740> which<00:05:45.919> is

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
all just going to be terrible which is

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.500 
all just going to be terrible which is
pretty<00:05:46.250> much<00:05:46.340> what<00:05:46.550> I<00:05:46.580> just<00:05:46.820> said<00:05:46.970> ultimately

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
pretty much what I just said ultimately

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.760 
pretty much what I just said ultimately
