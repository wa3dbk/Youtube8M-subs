will be going for here yes it will be
not<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.710> reactor<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.240> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.450> be

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that reactor barracks opening and we'll

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.760 
that reactor barracks opening and we'll
see<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.360> he<00:02:27.570> gets<00:02:27.720> another<00:02:28.110> barracks<00:02:28.560> right

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
see if he gets another barracks right

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.280 
see if he gets another barracks right
