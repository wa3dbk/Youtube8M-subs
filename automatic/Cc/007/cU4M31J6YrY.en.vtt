00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.490

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.809
 she alina personal your life now true 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.359
 it was being 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.679
 that person who is quite active right now 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.679
 is starting to something I think there is enough communication 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.109
 I'm watching it here 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.669
 percent is the world was temperance to the emperor are letters very 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:48.349
 good 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.349
 what happens that is distended maybe because it does not support a 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.459
 a little some discussion 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.579
 percent 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.779
 the package is affecting enough to do 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.049
 well the unemployment 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.339
 on astro tv like every night 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.729
 This is the protagonist along with you with your problem 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.339
 with your concern 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.499
 with the things that are worrying you right at this time of night 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:17.140
 what is possibly being done is that weary of these awake 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.220
 is because there is something that may not be working for you at that moment in your 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.779
 lifetime 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:25.619
 and here we can greet you in the best way that it demanded but this I do not 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.739
 I know if you have been told possibly 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 that you can be hired again 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.209
 in the work of the one that was previously 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.259
 they commented something yes yes 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.259
 when i looked brian p 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.340
 look at this I think they are already making changes in their work 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.580
 in the work I had before I was doing they have closed a cycle 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.829
 they are going to open another 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.659
 and they are already making changes and moved the good night now hit good night 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.789

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.680
 after completing from Pontevedra then a greeting to Pontevedra 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.189
 and even though three points will have cost 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.929
 I think wintour 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:17.389

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.689

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.699

 in the problems that they provide 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.460
