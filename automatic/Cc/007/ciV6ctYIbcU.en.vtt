00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.439
 very good kids data welcome 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.879
 one more time to my channel if the creever and 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.649
 we are back in the black ops 2 today 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.280
 I bring you a new nuclear in this case 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.840
 using the sml assault rifle 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.220
 semiautomatic that good I think not 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.020
 we have seen in no other call of duty 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.940
 and therefore , it makes me more 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.440
 difficult to get used to this weapon we do not like 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.180
 a fal or something that we have already seen in 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.980
 another in call of duty that good then you 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.080
 it's easier to control the girlfriend than 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.000
 those used in another preserve and well 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.470
 the sml seems to remind me that he has not 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.300
 come out in none touch it tuti so 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.590
 So much is a weapon that the truth has 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.450
 It cost me a little to get used to it 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.880
 but good in the end has come this 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.010
 nuclear pretty good the truth is not 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.260
 very very fast but good has his 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.550
 and in the end he left us several unstoppable 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.290
 that the truth is very well heading and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.210
 I hope you like good guys 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.920
 also I meant that I will 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.809
 spend quick moments like that moments that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.420
 I do not kill and such that it gets a little 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.280
 more short the video I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.860
 soon when it rises to prestige 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.270
 teacher I plan to do several things 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.399
 among them, you have asked me much 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.219
 I upload my stats my medals 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.899
 the game modes the victories the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.050
 proportion all that you have asked me 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.910
 very many and well, I'll upload it when 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.640
 to prestige teacher when I have arrived 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.890
 to the maximum and I will show you my statistics 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.840
 and all that I also wanted to do when 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.140
 there was a guide to the prestige teacher 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.550
 for good to teach you a little more to give 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.280
 the tips did not teach us to play 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.620
 because I really can not tell you then 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.980
 look take the control in this way and that 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 no but I can teach you tactical guides 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.180
 of tips for example how to 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.970
 play to get you a nuclear that 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.130
 streaks carry what weapon to use what 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.410
 strategy to follow in the middle of the game 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.150
 the spams all that where you have 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.040
 what to put and where not all that type 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.740
 of advice I think you can help 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.450
 quite and whoever is a player not very 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.370
 very experienced because I think that 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.530
 will quite obviously help if you are 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.880
 a player already semi professional and such that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.250
 you've been in call of many years 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.650
 duty like me well these tips good 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.320
 some can serve you and such but so 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.930
 you already have to know why 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 much of all that kind of stuff since 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 game mode play if you go alone and you 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.690
 wants to take nuclear only where 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 get in if you go with equipment and everything 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.440
 that also gives us advice for the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.180
 whole team for example if you go 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.940
 a team play really worth putting a 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.680
 example and 6-3 people because the guide does not 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.900
 would go only for one but wanted for the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 whole team for example as well already 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.020
 sabeis one has to put ua vee 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.050
 orbital response of the other one has to 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.460
 put an uve orbital and pm and so it goes 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.230
 varying so that the game is done 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.150
 much easier and quite more enjoyable 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.710
 and you get to make them the three the nuclear 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.200
 that what we have been looking for 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.790
 lately my colleagues and I at the end 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.670
 only nuclear doubles have come out since 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.230
 Well, it's hard not to accept a 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.520
 triple nuclear team does not depend on 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.070
 you but also depends on your 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.590
 companions and well then for one thing or 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.640
 on the other end it does not end up coming out 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.250
 obviously it will come out I think that if 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.440
 many people have uploaded it and such and such 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.060
 many people in quotation marks and well 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.770
 it's a matter of luck not of what guardianship 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.900
 gas and your other two companions also 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.460
 so nothing just wanted to wait and now 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.410
 will come out not I am going to do my 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.790
 nuclear and little by little then look if it 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.530
 align the stars and my other two 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.810
 comrades take it out then perfect 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.730
 as you see we have all the time he is an actor 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.410
 I 've already told you a thousand times 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.570
 You can do better with stripes 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.280
 help to get the nuclear because 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.840
 do you have 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.040
 You have a view of the entire map in Aden 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.110
 every moment therefore it is done 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.790
 pretty easy here you have the nuclear 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.770
 after the average orbital jump jump 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.480
 the medal is there and now I start with 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.790
 the unstoppable ones I get to do my 10 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 unstoppable since very happy so 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.690
 nothing guys leave me in the comments 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.310
 what do you think about the idea of the guide and what 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.170
 I'm watching I do not know what could help 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.510
 pretty and good it does not matter to make it or 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.280
 much less besides, I think of a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.110
 little more classes and so on 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.120
 think it also for myself to 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.040
 pose to me that it can be the best and such 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.440
 and Well let me comments 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.970
 I think if you think I have a good idea 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.950
 already received a couple of comments in 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.269
 twitter that they do not like much the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.040
 idea but good I do not know why the truth 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.019
 so nothing this has been all guys 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.209
 now let's go through the part of the 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.170
 medals and nothing see you tomorrow in the 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.450
 daily video 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.769
 remember to like to the video all that 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.690
 to help all who want it 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.069
 support some attempt to youtube and 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.900
 help me grow so leave a good 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.190
 etcetera so nothing this has been 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 I hope you liked it there 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.519
 the unstoppable greetings to all and up 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.519
 the next 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.519
 goodbye
