00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
with the pictures online I don't think

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.270

justice<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.490> the<00:00:48.900> helmet<00:00:49.900> is<00:00:50.020> one<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.320> those

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
justice and the helmet is one of those

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.950 
justice and the helmet is one of those
things<00:00:50.770> in<00:00:51.010> my<00:00:51.340> opinion<00:00:51.760> if<00:00:52.000> you're<00:00:52.810> going<00:00:52.900> to

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
things in my opinion if you're going to

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.140 
things in my opinion if you're going to
buy<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.170> without<00:00:54.100> having<00:00:54.730> had<00:00:54.970> the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
buy it without having had the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.080 
buy it without having had the
opportunity<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.750> put<00:00:55.990> your<00:00:56.110> hands<00:00:56.470> on<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:57.090> you

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
opportunity to put your hands on it you

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.150 
opportunity to put your hands on it you
need<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.480> have<00:00:58.630> as<00:00:58.930> much<00:00:59.140> information<00:00:59.620> as

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
need to have as much information as

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.530 
need to have as much information as
possible<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.240> had<00:01:01.480> as<00:01:01.750> closer<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.440> look<00:01:02.680> as

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
possible and had as closer to look as

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.719 
possible and had as closer to look as
possible<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.460> here<00:01:06.640> we<00:01:06.759> are<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.369> is<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.579> cool
