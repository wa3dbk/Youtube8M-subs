00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
built under the mix marks an overview

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.979 
built under the mix marks an overview
this<00:00:49.519> is<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.850> burning<00:00:50.090> chamber<00:00:50.449> of<00:00:50.720> course

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
this is the burning chamber of course

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.000 
this is the burning chamber of course
you<00:00:51.170> know<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.440> over<00:00:52.370> there<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.620> heat<00:00:54.620> was<00:00:54.769> more

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
you know it over there and heat was more

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.210 
you know it over there and heat was more
than<00:00:55.160> enough<00:00:55.340> when<00:00:56.090> I<00:00:56.120> was<00:00:56.239> testing<00:00:56.780> the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
than enough when I was testing the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.590 
than enough when I was testing the
heater<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:59.089> build<00:00:59.360> an<00:00:59.600> oven<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:01.420> did<00:01:02.420> buy

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
heater to build an oven so I did buy

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.950 
heater to build an oven so I did buy
some<00:01:02.739> steel<00:01:03.739> plate<00:01:04.460> about<00:01:05.449> three<00:01:05.750> millimeters

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
some steel plate about three millimeters

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.190 
some steel plate about three millimeters
thick<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:08.259> make<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.500> little<00:01:09.770> box

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
thick and I make a little box

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.180 
thick and I make a little box
now<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:12.470> welding<00:01:13.399> it<00:01:13.670> under<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.860> mix<00:01:15.860> marks

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
now I'm welding it under the mix marks

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.109 
now I'm welding it under the mix marks
and<00:01:17.090> after<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.930> we<00:01:18.229> make<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.369> little<00:01:19.520> door<00:01:19.910> in

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
and after that we make a little door in

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.469 
and after that we make a little door in
it<00:01:20.270> on<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.020> front<00:01:21.490> also<00:01:22.490> from<00:01:22.970> steel

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
it on the front also from steel

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.980 
it on the front also from steel
I<00:01:23.509> like<00:01:23.840> steel<00:01:24.580> why<00:01:25.580> not<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.740> then<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.280> have<00:01:28.990> to

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
I like steel why not and then we have to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.460 
I like steel why not and then we have to
make<00:01:30.140> Lakes<00:01:30.530> under<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.970> then<00:01:32.300> he<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.570> about

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
make Lakes under it and then he is about

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.940 
make Lakes under it and then he is about
ready<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.810> put<00:01:35.810> them<00:01:35.929> in<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.259> in<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.590> man<00:01:36.709> cave

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
starting to rain did test fire number

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.690 
starting to rain did test fire number
three<00:03:21.600> he<00:03:22.600> was<00:03:22.750> burning<00:03:22.989> almost<00:03:23.650> directly<00:03:24.430> and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
three he was burning almost directly and

three he was burning almost directly and
it<00:03:25.390> was<00:03:25.510> good<00:03:25.720> burning<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:27.340> are<00:03:27.489> sticks<00:03:27.760> in

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970

now<00:03:28.260> 50<00:03:29.260> centimetres<00:03:29.920> long<00:03:30.160> so<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.709> have<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.830> go

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
now 50 centimetres long so I have to go

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.690 
now 50 centimetres long so I have to go
inside

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
inside

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.810

I<00:03:36.330> did<00:03:37.330> try<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.630> measure<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.650> oven<00:03:38.980> but<00:03:39.400> I

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
I did try to measure in the oven but I

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.800 
I did try to measure in the oven but I
think<00:03:40.269> because<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.500> rain<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.830> have<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.130> stop

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
think because of the rain I have to stop

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.690 
think because of the rain I have to stop
the<00:03:43.810> air<00:03:43.989> opening<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.620> bigger<00:03:44.860> is<00:03:45.160> burning<00:03:45.549> now

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the air opening is bigger is burning now
