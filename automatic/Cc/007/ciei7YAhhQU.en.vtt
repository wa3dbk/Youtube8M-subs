found<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.920> too<00:02:29.099> difficult<00:02:29.130> they<00:02:29.730> didn't<00:02:30.090> blow

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
found it too difficult they didn't blow

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.960 
found it too difficult they didn't blow
down<00:02:30.599> my<00:02:30.810> brush<00:02:31.019> willfully<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.430> took<00:02:32.609> far

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
down my brush willfully and it took far

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.110 
down my brush willfully and it took far
too<00:02:33.000> much<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.540> even<00:02:33.810> show<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.200> little<00:02:34.320> bit<00:02:35.120> in

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
too much to even show up a little bit in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120 
too much to even show up a little bit in
the<00:02:36.329> first<00:02:36.570> few<00:02:36.840> swatches<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
the first few swatches you can see the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.490 
the first few swatches you can see the
neutral<00:02:38.609> tones<00:02:38.840> these<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.109> ones<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.380> was

neutral tones these are the ones I was

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.080 
neutral tones these are the ones I was
less<00:02:40.709> interested<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.220> anyway<00:02:41.579> because<00:02:41.820> I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
less interested in anyway because I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.770 
less interested in anyway because I
already<00:02:42.329> have<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.590> lot<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.910> neutral<00:02:45.420> palettes

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.039 
I would say that from a drugstore makeup
perspective<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:30.609> one<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.420> good<00:03:31.659> palates

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
perspective it's one of the good palates

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.640 
perspective it's one of the good palates

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
kind of a cherry pink

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.250 
kind of a cherry pink
it<00:03:48.189> does<00:03:48.340> depend<00:03:48.459> I've<00:03:48.879> laid<00:03:49.209> up<00:03:49.540> quite<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.959> bit

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
it does depend I've laid up quite a bit

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.710 
it does depend I've laid up quite a bit
so<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.620> looks<00:03:50.650> more<00:03:50.980> red<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:52.120> in<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.420> swatch

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
so it looks more red but in the swatch

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.349 
so it looks more red but in the swatch
you'll<00:03:53.049> see<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.379> looked<00:03:53.590> quite<00:03:53.799> pink

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
you'll see it looked quite pink

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.629 
you'll see it looked quite pink
I<00:03:55.389> wasn't<00:03:56.049> massively<00:03:56.620> impressed<00:03:57.069> with<00:03:57.220> 100%

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
I wasn't massively impressed with 100%

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.819 
I wasn't massively impressed with 100%
ban<00:03:58.120> because<00:03:58.629> it<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.260> very<00:03:59.560> very<00:04:00.250> dark<00:04:00.760> purple

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
ban because it is very very dark purple

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.379 
ban because it is very very dark purple
I'm<00:04:02.829> thinking<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.519> think<00:04:03.639> it'll<00:04:03.940> grow<00:04:04.120> on<00:04:04.150> me

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
I'm thinking I think it'll grow on me

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.420 
I'm thinking I think it'll grow on me
but<00:04:04.540> even<00:04:04.660> if<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> doesn't<00:04:05.139> these<00:04:05.709> are<00:04:05.919> only<00:04:06.129> 1

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
but even if it doesn't these are only 1

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.909 
but even if it doesn't these are only 1
pound<00:04:06.669> each<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.900> perfect<00:04:08.139> start<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.680> get

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
pound each so the perfect start to get

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.399 
pound each so the perfect start to get
into<00:04:09.220> makeup<00:04:10.139> about<00:04:11.139> packaging<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.129> quite

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
into makeup about packaging it's quite

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.219 
into makeup about packaging it's quite
flimsy<00:04:14.409> I<00:04:14.769> don't<00:04:14.980> feel<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:15.780> stays<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:16.959> now

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
flimsy I don't feel that it stays on now

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.319 
flimsy I don't feel that it stays on now
for<00:04:17.289> me<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:17.769> it's<00:04:17.919> not<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.220> kind<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.579> lipstick

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
for me so it's not the kind of lipstick

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.759 
for me so it's not the kind of lipstick
that<00:04:19.449> I<00:04:19.539> would<00:04:19.720> chuck<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.019> my<00:04:20.109> bag<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.470> forget

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
that I would chuck in my bag and forget

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.339 
that I would chuck in my bag and forget
about<00:04:20.859> because<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.489> would<00:04:21.810> open<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.139> get<00:04:23.229> all

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
pamphlet is quite Brown but as when you

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.589 
pamphlet is quite Brown but as when you
put<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:46.900> on<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.199> quite<00:04:47.710> dark<00:04:48.190> purple

and so you don't need a lot of it for

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.820 
and so you don't need a lot of it for
that<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:51.999> show<00:04:52.149> in<00:04:52.990> terms<00:04:53.199> of<00:04:53.349> how<00:04:53.469> it<00:04:53.589> feels

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.559 
that to show in terms of how it feels
and<00:04:54.219> how<00:04:54.399> it<00:04:54.520> looks<00:04:54.699> everything<00:04:54.969> I'm<00:04:55.389> quite

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
and how it looks everything I'm quite

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.350 
and how it looks everything I'm quite
happy<00:04:55.719> with<00:04:56.020> how<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.319> looks<00:04:56.939> how<00:04:57.939> it<00:04:58.089> feels

happy with how it looks how it feels

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.049

it's<00:04:58.599> nice<00:04:58.749> and<00:04:59.309> stocky<00:05:00.309> and<00:05:00.339> smooth<00:05:00.759> when<00:05:00.939> it

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:01.059 
it's nice and stocky and smooth when it

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.600 
it's nice and stocky and smooth when it
goes<00:05:01.209> on<00:05:01.449> but<00:05:02.229> I<00:05:02.259> find<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.249> smudges

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
goes on but I find that it smudges

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.850 
goes on but I find that it smudges
really<00:05:04.179> easily<00:05:04.659> it<00:05:04.809> doesn't<00:05:04.959> kind<00:05:05.259> of<00:05:05.409> scent

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
really easily it doesn't kind of scent

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.540 
really easily it doesn't kind of scent
like<00:05:06.490> some<00:05:06.819> other<00:05:06.969> little<00:05:07.209> lip<00:05:07.479> singers<00:05:07.779> do<00:05:08.550> so

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
like some other little lip singers do so

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.429 
like some other little lip singers do so
it's<00:05:09.879> not<00:05:09.969> something<00:05:10.629> that<00:05:10.659> I<00:05:10.990> would<00:05:11.229> wear

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439 
it's not something that I would wear

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.070 
it's not something that I would wear
every<00:05:11.770> day<00:05:12.129> I<00:05:12.399> don't<00:05:12.610> think<00:05:12.969> that's<00:05:13.629> it<00:05:13.869> for<00:05:14.020> me

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080
