 little has been seen progress in it 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.650
 from this work people already already occupy 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.680
 the dumpsters worry about collecting their 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.759
 junk worries about not throwing the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.500
 trash to the beaches the attention to whom 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.660
 crabs are taking great care and are 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.740
 also taking care of their garbage cans 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.060
 we invite everyone that their trash 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.060

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.030
 you do not have to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 We are contributing to the environment 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.829
 environment and talking about pollution 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 Every Monday what we do is with 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.610
 all your mates clean the beach 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.730
 because on Saturdays and Sundays 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.829
 people leave two contaminated with 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.939
 plastic bottles and what we do 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.939
 we are picking 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.680

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.980

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.379
 clean that will do now clean 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.599
 here it is noted that there is a part effort 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.849
 the crab community to keep 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.720
 to try to keep this beach 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.310
 clean 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.379
 obviously they have to fight like 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.989
 holiday makers who do not have the same 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.129
 culture with the same interest but 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.460
 definitely have to follow 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.360
 working and not losing it 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.360
 to the penalty 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.830
 as we have seen the campaign is of 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.420
 Beach cleaning must also be seen 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.220

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.440
 it's the caverns we have the rocky part 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.519
