person next to a double they don't
quadruple<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.549> guess<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.790> did<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.000> for

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
quadruple and I guess it did that for

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.400 
quadruple and I guess it did that for
gameplay<00:02:33.360> purposes<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.170> thought<00:02:34.319> that's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
gameplay purposes but I thought that's

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.009 
gameplay purposes but I thought that's
kind<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.650> lame<00:02:34.830> yeah<00:02:35.459> III<00:02:36.209> thought<00:02:36.870> it'd<00:02:36.989> be

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
kind of lame yeah III thought it'd be

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.330 
kind of lame yeah III thought it'd be
neat<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.349> know<00:02:37.379> if<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.620> could<00:02:37.739> quadruple<00:02:38.310> or

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
neat you know if you could quadruple or

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
neat you know if you could quadruple or
quintuple<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.510> if<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> could<00:02:39.930> pull<00:02:40.140> off

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
quintuple you know if you could pull off

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
quintuple you know if you could pull off
the<00:02:40.440> right<00:02:40.590> combo<00:02:41.040> right<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.879> there<00:02:42.000> were

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the right combo right because there were

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.850 
the right combo right because there were
some<00:02:42.239> times<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.690> game<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.680> game

buys it or not then we look at the
second<00:03:50.970> number<00:03:51.150> that's<00:03:51.329> how<00:03:51.450> much<00:03:51.599> you're

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the course of the game and I might

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.340 
the course of the game and I might
mention<00:04:47.730> that<00:04:47.910> they<00:04:48.150> did<00:04:48.570> not<00:04:48.720> include<00:04:48.930> enough

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
mention that they did not include enough

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.170 
mention that they did not include enough
money<00:04:49.560> in<00:04:49.680> my<00:04:49.770> opinion<00:04:49.860> we<00:04:50.820> had<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.030> make

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
money in my opinion we had to make

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.830 
money in my opinion we had to make
change<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.720> whole<00:04:51.960> game<00:04:52.550> too<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:54.570> get<00:04:54.720> enough

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
change the whole game too to get enough

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.150 
change the whole game too to get enough
coins<00:04:55.110> back<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.680> was<00:04:55.770> only<00:04:55.920> in<00:04:56.100> a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
coins back and that was only in a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.230 
coins back and that was only in a
three-player<00:04:56.490> game<00:04:56.550> too

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
three-player game too

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.080 
three-player game too
so<00:04:58.220> they<00:04:59.220> should<00:04:59.400> have<00:04:59.490> put<00:04:59.580> more<00:04:59.730> money<00:04:59.910> in

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
so they should have put more money in

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.360 
so they should have put more money in
not<00:05:00.930> not<00:05:01.260> not<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.620> making<00:05:01.890> change<00:05:02.070> this<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.310> a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
not not not to making change this is a

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.180 
not not not to making change this is a
big<00:05:02.520> deal<00:05:02.670> but<00:05:02.940> know<00:05:03.780> what<00:05:04.200> I<00:05:04.230> mean<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.890> don't

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
big deal but know what I mean I don't

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.380 
big deal but know what I mean I don't
know<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.520> would<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.790> put<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.060> lot<00:05:06.180> more

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
know I would have put in a lot more

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.320 
know I would have put in a lot more
fives<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:07.350> drop<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.400> 50s<00:05:08.790> because<00:05:09.030> we<00:05:09.150> didn't

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
fives and drop the 50s because we didn't

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.840 
fives and drop the 50s because we didn't
even<00:05:09.450> need<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.630> 50s<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.950> that's<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.670> what

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
even need the 50s so that's it what

whereas most money is the winner there
you<00:05:13.590> go<00:05:13.740> it's<00:05:14.600> it's<00:05:15.600> thematic<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:16.440> can

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
you go it's it's thematic I can

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.260 
you go it's it's thematic I can
understand<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.370> guests<00:05:17.640> coming<00:05:17.910> back<00:05:18.090> and

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
understand the guests coming back and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.050 
understand the guests coming back and
forth<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:18.750> paying<00:05:18.990> money<00:05:19.200> and<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:20.310> makes<00:05:20.610> a

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
forth and paying money and it makes a

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.040 
forth and paying money and it makes a
very<00:05:21.210> strong<00:05:21.570> euro<00:05:22.290> game<00:05:22.980> I<00:05:23.370> guess<00:05:24.050> because

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
very strong euro game I guess because

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.920 
very strong euro game I guess because
there's<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.890> doubling<00:05:26.490> there's<00:05:26.850> extra<00:05:27.660> rooms

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
there's the doubling there's extra rooms

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.710 
there's the doubling there's extra rooms
to<00:05:28.260> put<00:05:28.440> people<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.970> people<00:05:30.360> leaving

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
to put people the people leaving

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.680 
to put people the people leaving
incoming<00:05:31.790> different<00:05:32.790> kinds<00:05:33.030> of<00:05:33.120> people<00:05:33.390> money

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
incoming different kinds of people money

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.440 
incoming different kinds of people money
playing<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.620> card<00:05:34.890> face<00:05:35.100> that<00:05:35.340> same<00:05:35.610> time<00:05:35.910> but<00:05:36.420> I

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
playing a card face that same time but I

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.550 
playing a card face that same time but I
mean<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:36.690> does<00:05:36.810> make<00:05:36.840> sense<00:05:37.230> where<00:05:37.380> we're<00:05:37.500> off

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
mean it does make sense where we're off

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.900 
mean it does make sense where we're off
to<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.740> cheapest<00:05:38.070> price<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.670> what<00:05:38.790> people

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
to the cheapest price that's what people

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.550 
to the cheapest price that's what people
go<00:05:39.120> first<00:05:39.360> right<00:05:39.750> although<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.500> think

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
go first right although you think

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.990 
go first right although you think
richest<00:05:41.010> people<00:05:41.100> would<00:05:41.340> go<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.790> more

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
richest people would go to the more

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.090 
richest people would go to the more
expensive<00:05:42.450> ones<00:05:42.630> they<00:05:42.810> would<00:05:43.050> but<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:43.950> know<00:05:44.040> I

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
expensive ones they would but you know I

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.310 
expensive ones they would but you know I
mean<00:05:44.250> it's<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.270> cool<00:05:45.420> game<00:05:45.570> from<00:05:45.750> what<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:45.960> was<00:05:46.110> I

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
enjoyed playing it the only the only

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.780 
enjoyed playing it the only the only
problems<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.220> have<00:05:50.370> with<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.580> or<00:05:50.760> just

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
problems that I have with it or just

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.910 
problems that I have with it or just
fiddly<00:05:51.450> issues<00:05:51.720> I<00:05:51.930> mean<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.470> fact<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.770> they

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
fiddly issues I mean the fact that they

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.340 
fiddly issues I mean the fact that they
did<00:05:53.010> include<00:05:53.190> American<00:05:53.640> flags<00:05:53.880> if<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:54.720> really

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
did include American flags if I really

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.780 
did include American flags if I really
want<00:06:00.980> we'll<00:06:01.980> leave<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:02.340> alone<00:06:02.400> for<00:06:02.760> right

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
want we'll leave that alone for right

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.710 
want we'll leave that alone for right
now<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.570> game<00:06:03.840> is<00:06:04.340> decent<00:06:05.340> it's<00:06:05.670> not<00:06:05.970> deeply

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
now the game is decent it's not deeply

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.520 
now the game is decent it's not deeply
strategic<00:06:07.470> but<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:08.190> can<00:06:08.550> be<00:06:09.020> so<00:06:10.020> maybe<00:06:10.230> the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
strategic but it can be so maybe the

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.440 
strategic but it can be so maybe the
analysis<00:06:11.400> paralysis<00:06:11.640> people<00:06:12.120> want<00:06:12.270> to<00:06:12.330> stay

analysis paralysis people want to stay

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.870 
analysis paralysis people want to stay
away<00:06:12.630> from<00:06:12.690> it<00:06:12.960> but<00:06:13.140> I<00:06:13.490> liked<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:14.610> it's
