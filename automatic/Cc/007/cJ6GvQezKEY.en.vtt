00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
how's it going guys done about here Tim

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.880 
how's it going guys done about here Tim
bringing<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.909> discussion<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.990> infinite

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
bringing you a discussion on infinite

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.820 
bringing you a discussion on infinite
worlds<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.430> biomes<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.270> 0.9<00:00:07.020> point<00:00:07.290> zero<00:00:07.560> and

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
worlds and biomes in 0.9 point zero and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.440 
worlds and biomes in 0.9 point zero and
this<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.000> centered<00:00:09.360> around

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this is going to be centered around

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.799 
this is going to be centered around
jungle<00:00:10.080> biomes<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:11.280> um<00:00:11.429> anyway<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.719> all

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
jungle biomes but um anyway this is all

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.330 
jungle biomes but um anyway this is all
coming<00:00:13.019> from<00:00:13.110> Tomas<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.590> reddit<00:00:13.920> feed<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
coming from Tomas was reddit feed and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.980 
coming from Tomas was reddit feed and
the<00:00:15.030> first<00:00:15.299> topic<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.910> johan

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
the first topic is about on johan

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.210 
the first topic is about on johan
stating<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.109> there's<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.770> new

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
stating that there's going to be new

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.330 
stating that there's going to be new
biomes<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> 0.9<00:00:21.300> update<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.160> this<00:00:23.160> guy

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
biomes in the 0.9 update and this guy

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.740 
biomes in the 0.9 update and this guy
was<00:00:23.490> asking<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:23.970> everybody<00:00:24.330> thinks<00:00:24.480> about

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
was asking what everybody thinks about

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.589 
was asking what everybody thinks about
and<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.680> guy<00:00:25.800> over<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.279> says<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:27.180> guessing

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and one guy over here says just guessing

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
and one guy over here says just guessing
but<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.930> probably<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:28.980> all

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
but it's probably going to be like all

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.609 
but it's probably going to be like all
the<00:00:29.400> original<00:00:29.760> biomes<00:00:30.449> except<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.170> jungles

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the original biomes except for jungles

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.760 
the original biomes except for jungles
and<00:00:32.930> he<00:00:33.930> says<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.290> while<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.590> may<00:00:34.620> see

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and he says that while we may see

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370 
and he says that while we may see
jungles<00:00:35.430> there<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.239> apparently<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> lot

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
jungles there are apparently like a lot

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.220 
jungles there are apparently like a lot
of<00:00:37.500> hardware<00:00:37.920> problems<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
of hardware problems with them and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.990 
of hardware problems with them and
pretty<00:00:40.230> much<00:00:40.290> anything<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.790> like

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pretty much anything that would be like

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
pretty much anything that would be like
normal<00:00:42.270> biomes<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> plains<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
normal biomes like the plains the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.299 
normal biomes like the plains the
extreme<00:00:44.550> Hills<00:00:44.910> Tyga<00:00:45.719> deserts<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> forests

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
extreme Hills Tyga deserts and forests

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
extreme Hills Tyga deserts and forests
are<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.690> available<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.289> Tom

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
are all going to be available and Tom

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.639 
are all going to be available and Tom
responses<00:00:50.579> saying<00:00:50.910> exactly<00:00:51.449> we're<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
responses saying exactly we're going to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910 
responses saying exactly we're going to
see<00:00:53.010> most<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.180> new<00:00:54.420> biomes<00:00:54.920> excluding

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
see most of the new biomes excluding

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
see most of the new biomes excluding
jungles<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.430> roof<00:00:56.610> forests<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.899> there's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
jungles and roof forests because there's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
jungles and roof forests because there's
a<00:00:58.770> problem<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.750> transparency<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
a problem with transparency and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.700 
a problem with transparency and
basically<00:01:02.070> any<00:01:02.629> block<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.840> transparency

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
basically any block that's transparency

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
basically any block that's transparency
in<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.040> leaves<00:01:05.510> jungles<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
in it like leaves jungles have a lot of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.460 
in it like leaves jungles have a lot of
leaves<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.909> we<00:01:08.909> use<00:01:09.150> our<00:01:09.390> transparent<00:01:10.170> blocks

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
leaves and we use our transparent blocks

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.690 
leaves and we use our transparent blocks
and<00:01:11.210> they<00:01:12.210> cause<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> lag<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.490> more

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and they cause a lot of lag and the more

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
and they cause a lot of lag and the more
leaves<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.900> lag<00:01:16.080> year<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> game

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
leaves there are the lag year the game

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.480 
leaves there are the lag year the game
is<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.840> pretty<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.560> aren't<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
is so pretty much they aren't going to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
is so pretty much they aren't going to
be<00:01:20.580> able<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.060> jungle<00:01:21.810> biomes<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
be able to do jungle biomes because of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.940 
be able to do jungle biomes because of
the<00:01:23.280> high<00:01:23.549> density<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> leaves<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> he<00:01:25.770> says

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the high density of leaves and he says

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.280 
the high density of leaves and he says
pretty<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.420> new<00:01:27.810> biomes

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
pretty much you can see all new biomes

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
pretty much you can see all new biomes
with<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> exception<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.070> jungles<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.670> roof

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
with the exception of jungles and roof

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.410 
with the exception of jungles and roof
force<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.740> leaf<00:01:31.979> problem<00:01:32.490> also

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
force because of that leaf problem also

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.170 
force because of that leaf problem also
the<00:01:33.720> world<00:01:33.990> height<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> stay<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.340> 128

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the world height is going to stay at 128

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
the world height is going to stay at 128
blocks<00:01:36.479> I'm<00:01:36.810> assuming<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:38.009> they

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
blocks I'm assuming it's because they

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
blocks I'm assuming it's because they
don't<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.700> any<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.210> blocks<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.810> generating

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
don't want any more blocks in generating

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.789 
don't want any more blocks in generating
than<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.100> already<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.409> not<00:01:43.409> only<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
than there already are and not only that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.580 
than there already are and not only that
but<00:01:44.250> um<00:01:44.689> population<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.780> still<00:01:45.869> supported<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
but um population is still supported by

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.999 
but um population is still supported by
slower<00:01:47.009> devices<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:49.439> more<00:01:49.710> blocks

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
slower devices so on with more blocks

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
slower devices so on with more blocks
generating<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> cause<00:01:51.360> more

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
generating it's just going to cause more

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
generating it's just going to cause more
lag<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> create<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
lag and they don't want to create that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.990 
lag and they don't want to create that
problem<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.869> generally<00:01:55.619> tom<00:01:56.189> says<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.790> they

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
problem but generally tom says that they

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.109 
problem but generally tom says that they
have<00:01:57.299> no<00:01:57.630> problem<00:01:58.369> incorporating<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
have no problem incorporating all of the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
have no problem incorporating all of the
other<00:02:00.329> biomes<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.530> means<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:01.979> going

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.110 
want that option and you're going to
have<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.010> create<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> new<00:02:38.460> world<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.910> want

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
those new terrain generation options so

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.350 
those new terrain generation options so
if<00:02:42.030> say<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:42.990> want<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.890> continue<00:02:44.280> expanding<00:02:45.000> my

so this next reddit post is kind of like

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.370 
so this next reddit post is kind of like
a<00:03:31.110> complaint<00:03:31.620> form<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.420> somebody<00:03:33.420> made<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
post saying that the only thing that you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.120 
post saying that the only thing that you
is<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.239> looking<00:03:36.360> forward<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.350> 0.9

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
is really looking forward to in 0.9

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.240 
is really looking forward to in 0.9
point<00:03:38.400> zero<00:03:38.670> was<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.930> jungle<00:03:40.320> biomes<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.920> why

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
point zero was the jungle biomes and why

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.430 
point zero was the jungle biomes and why
can't<00:03:41.730> they<00:03:41.850> add<00:03:42.060> them<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.540> Tom<00:03:43.080> pretty<00:03:43.320> much

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
can't they add them and Tom pretty much

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.520 
can't they add them and Tom pretty much
explains<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.160> again<00:03:44.459> how<00:03:45.200> there's<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.320> problem

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
explains it again how there's a problem

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.009 
explains it again how there's a problem
or<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.370> only<00:03:47.700> problem<00:03:48.030> with<00:03:48.180> jungles<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
or the only problem with jungles is the

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.050 
or the only problem with jungles is the
fact<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.440> there's<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> transparent<00:03:50.730> leaves

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
fact that there's the transparent leaves

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.370 
fact that there's the transparent leaves
and<00:03:51.920> jungles<00:03:52.920> don't<00:03:53.160> run<00:03:53.519> very<00:03:53.550> well<00:03:54.000> on<00:03:54.450> any

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
and jungles don't run very well on any

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.070

how<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.250> going<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.550> work<00:04:08.670> when<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.120> join

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
how is this going to work when you join

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.050 
how is this going to work when you join
realms<00:04:09.750> because<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.530> realm<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.489> like<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> shared

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
realms because a realm is like a shared

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.910 
realms because a realm is like a shared
server<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.750> not<00:04:12.930> everybody<00:04:13.350> who<00:04:13.530> plays<00:04:13.739> on

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
server and not everybody who plays on

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.610 
server and not everybody who plays on
realms<00:04:14.250> has<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.549> cutting-edge<00:04:15.090> device<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.380> um

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
realms has a cutting-edge device so um

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.680 
realms has a cutting-edge device so um
if<00:04:16.890> some<00:04:17.100> people<00:04:17.400> have<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:17.729> tumbled<00:04:18.239> on<00:04:18.359> some

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
if some people have that tumbled on some

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.390 
if some people have that tumbled on some
people<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.140> toggled<00:04:19.680> off<00:04:19.769> it'll<00:04:20.130> create

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
people have it toggled off it'll create

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.390 
people have it toggled off it'll create
problems<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.690> they're<00:04:22.350> mainly<00:04:22.830> leaving<00:04:23.310> it

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
problems so they're mainly leaving it

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.600 
problems so they're mainly leaving it
out<00:04:23.610> because<00:04:23.880> on<00:04:24.860> they<00:04:25.860> just<00:04:26.070> want<00:04:26.310> everybody

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
out because on they just want everybody

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.740 
out because on they just want everybody
to<00:04:26.850> be<00:04:26.970> able<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.479> same

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
to be able to have the same

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.080 
to be able to have the same
gameplay<00:04:28.080> experience<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:29.490> toggle

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
gameplay experience and that toggle

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.080 
gameplay experience and that toggle
switch<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.630> something<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.200> they<00:04:31.380> consider

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
switch is something that they consider

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.950 
switch is something that they consider
but<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.870> would<00:04:34.110> cause<00:04:34.350> problems<00:04:34.500> for<00:04:35.040> servers

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
but it would cause problems for servers

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.690 
but it would cause problems for servers
he<00:04:36.960> also<00:04:37.170> says<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.710> they<00:04:38.040> could<00:04:38.280> add<00:04:38.490> an

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
he also says that they could add an

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.500 
he also says that they could add an
option<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.570> make<00:04:40.460> jungle<00:04:41.460> trees<00:04:41.730> by<00:04:42.060> default

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
option to make jungle trees by default

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.290

and infinite worlds tom says that there
is<00:05:18.720> going<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.080> be<00:05:19.110> something<00:05:19.550> exclusive<00:05:20.550> and

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
is going to be something exclusive and

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.150 
is going to be something exclusive and
one<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.750> going<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.110> make<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.440> world<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.860> end<00:05:22.980> a

bit more awesome so I'm thinking that if
you<00:05:25.440> don't<00:05:25.590> have<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.100> infinite<00:05:26.820> worlds

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
you don't have the infinite worlds

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.680 
you don't have the infinite worlds
option<00:05:28.620> toggled<00:05:29.340> there's<00:05:29.940> going<00:05:30.390> they're

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
going to make the world like finish off

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.680 
going to make the world like finish off
some<00:05:33.750> sort<00:05:34.290> of<00:05:34.350> epic<00:05:34.710> way<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.479> there's<00:05:36.479> going

ones already in PC minecraft the other
is<00:05:42.210> going<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.690> be<00:05:42.840> really<00:05:43.080> cool<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:44.220> will

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
is going to be really cool and it will

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.150 
is going to be really cool and it will
all<00:05:44.640> make<00:05:44.669> sense<00:05:44.910> later<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:46.590> he's<00:05:46.950> being

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
all make sense later so he's being

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.130 
all make sense later so he's being
really<00:05:47.340> vague<00:05:47.430> about<00:05:47.910> these<00:05:48.140> exclusive

really vague about these exclusive
features<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:50.810> hopefully<00:05:51.810> he'll<00:05:52.410> shed<00:05:52.680> some

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
features and hopefully he'll shed some

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.520 
features and hopefully he'll shed some
light<00:05:53.160> on<00:05:53.310> that<00:05:53.490> in<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.760> future<00:05:53.970> but<00:05:54.900> as<00:05:55.080> for

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
light on that in the future but as for

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.490 
light on that in the future but as for
now<00:05:55.560> we<00:05:56.280> don't<00:05:56.400> know<00:05:56.550> what<00:05:56.850> they<00:05:56.970> are<00:05:57.110> all<00:05:58.110> we

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.480 
now we don't know what they are all we
do<00:05:58.680> know<00:05:58.950> is<00:05:59.220> that<00:06:01.250> will<00:06:02.250> pretty<00:06:02.370> much

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
do know is that will pretty much

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.510 
do know is that will pretty much
anything<00:06:02.790> that<00:06:02.940> I<00:06:03.060> discussed<00:06:03.540> on<00:06:03.870> old<00:06:04.740> worlds

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
anything that I discussed on old worlds

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.260 
anything that I discussed on old worlds
like<00:06:05.850> 0.8<00:06:06.600> point<00:06:06.840> 0<00:06:07.110> and<00:06:07.290> prior<00:06:07.560> will<00:06:08.280> use<00:06:08.640> the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
like 0.8 point 0 and prior will use the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.870 
like 0.8 point 0 and prior will use the
old<00:06:09.540> terrain<00:06:10.080> generation<00:06:10.320> and<00:06:10.950> you<00:06:11.640> can

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
old terrain generation and you can

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.270 
old terrain generation and you can
toggle<00:06:12.450> whether<00:06:12.960> you<00:06:13.200> want<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:13.650> expand

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
toggle whether you want it to expand

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.550 
toggle whether you want it to expand
infinitely<00:06:14.700> or<00:06:15.240> if<00:06:15.750> you<00:06:15.870> want<00:06:16.050> to<00:06:16.140> keep<00:06:16.320> it<00:06:16.470> the

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
infinitely or if you want to keep it the

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.390 
infinitely or if you want to keep it the
same<00:06:16.590> size<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.460> same<00:06:18.419> thing<00:06:18.930> applies<00:06:19.350> for<00:06:19.800> 0.9

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
same size the same thing applies for 0.9

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.400 
same size the same thing applies for 0.9
point<00:06:20.669> 0<00:06:20.940> worlds<00:06:21.360> but<00:06:21.479> they<00:06:21.630> will<00:06:21.780> use<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.260> new

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
point 0 worlds but they will use the new

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.430 
point 0 worlds but they will use the new
terrain<00:06:22.650> generator<00:06:23.250> and<00:06:23.840> they<00:06:24.840> will<00:06:25.050> also

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
terrain generator and they will also

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.080 
terrain generator and they will also
include<00:06:25.770> every<00:06:26.250> new<00:06:26.430> biome<00:06:26.820> with<00:06:26.970> the

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
include every new biome with the

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.510 
include every new biome with the
exception<00:06:27.660> of<00:06:27.840> jungle<00:06:28.500> leave<00:06:28.710> with<00:06:29.430> the

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
exception of jungle leave with the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.060 
exception of jungle leave with the
exception<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.880> jungles<00:06:30.360> roof<00:06:31.200> forests<00:06:31.890> and

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
exception of jungles roof forests and

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.300 
exception of jungles roof forests and
amplified<00:06:32.790> biomes<00:06:33.680> also<00:06:34.680> they're<00:06:34.919> thinking

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
amplified biomes also they're thinking

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.430 
amplified biomes also they're thinking
how<00:06:35.760> they<00:06:36.000> can<00:06:36.240> implement<00:06:36.630> jungle<00:06:37.110> biomes

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
how they can implement jungle biomes

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.650 
how they can implement jungle biomes
without<00:06:37.950> literally<00:06:38.490> ruining<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.210> game<00:06:39.360> for

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
without literally ruining the game for

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.320 
without literally ruining the game for
everybody

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
everybody

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.850

there's also going to be exclusive

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.469 
there's also going to be exclusive
features<00:06:42.430> but<00:06:42.610> we<00:06:42.819> don't<00:06:43.030> know<00:06:43.180> what<00:06:43.360> those

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 
features but we don't know what those

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.320 
features but we don't know what those
are<00:06:43.539> going<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:43.900> be<00:06:44.430> anyway<00:06:45.430> this<00:06:45.759> is<00:06:46.090> the<00:06:46.300> end

was<00:06:48.759> discussion<00:06:49.479> about<00:06:49.539> infinite<00:06:50.080> worlds<00:06:50.469> and

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
was discussion about infinite worlds and

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.249 
was discussion about infinite worlds and
biomes<00:06:51.909> which<00:06:52.180> is<00:06:52.330> always<00:06:52.689> going<00:06:52.870> to<00:06:52.960> be<00:06:53.080> long

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
biomes which is always going to be long

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.520 
biomes which is always going to be long
but<00:06:53.469> it's<00:06:53.710> really<00:06:54.539> rather<00:06:55.539> informative<00:06:56.229> and<00:06:56.469> I
