help with different things for instance

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
help with different things for instance
bacteria<00:01:47.520> versus<00:01:47.939> healing<00:01:48.390> versus<00:01:48.930> fat<00:01:49.170> loss

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
bacteria versus healing versus fat loss

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
bacteria versus healing versus fat loss
and<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.340> reason<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> different<00:01:51.479> colors

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and the reason that the different colors

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780 
and the reason that the different colors
do<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:52.829> each<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.610> color

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
do that is because each different color

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
do that is because each different color
has<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> different<00:01:54.270> wavelength<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:56.009> back

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
has a different wavelength if we go back

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
has a different wavelength if we go back
into<00:01:56.490> science<00:01:56.670> class<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.270> learned<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.600> each

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
into science class we learned that each

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.039 
into science class we learned that each
color<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.469> different<00:01:58.619> wave<00:01:59.280> of<00:02:00.049> basically

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
color has a different wave of basically

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.300 
color has a different wave of basically
has<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> different<00:02:01.590> wavelength<00:02:01.950> than<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
has a different wavelength than when it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.459 
has a different wavelength than when it
bounces<00:02:02.790> off<00:02:02.939> something<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.259> see

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
bounces off something that's what we see

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
bounces off something that's what we see
is<00:02:04.590> light<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.520> things<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:06.030> different

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
is light so things that have different

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
is light so things that have different
wavelengths<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.350> makes<00:02:07.710> us<00:02:07.890> see

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
wavelengths is what makes us see

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.749 
wavelengths is what makes us see
different<00:02:08.459> colors<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:08.940> instance<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.360> look

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
different colors for instance if we look

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.190 
different colors for instance if we look
something<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.149> it's<00:02:10.269> red<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.689> bounces<00:02:11.110> off

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
something and it's red it bounces off

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
something and it's red it bounces off
red<00:02:11.470> because<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.980> wavelength<00:02:12.400> or<00:02:12.670> white

with<00:02:31.060> acne<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.470> why<00:02:32.650> these<00:02:32.709> home

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
with acne so that is why these home

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.399 
with acne so that is why these home
systems<00:02:33.610> are<00:02:33.730> very<00:02:33.909> popular<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.720> because<00:02:35.230> it's

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
systems are very popular is because it's

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.559 
systems are very popular is because it's
like<00:02:35.560> oh<00:02:35.709> well<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> idea<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.819> we

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
like oh well this is the idea that we

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.860 
like oh well this is the idea that we
should<00:02:37.780> put<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.170> blue<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:38.799> red<00:02:39.269> LED<00:02:40.269> lights<00:02:40.540> at

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
should put the blue or red LED lights at

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.690 
should put the blue or red LED lights at
home<00:02:41.109> and<00:02:41.349> you<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.769> people<00:02:42.159> can<00:02:42.310> use<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.579> at

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
home and you know people can use it at

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.430 
home and you know people can use it at
home<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:43.090> six<00:02:43.629> years<00:02:43.840> ago<00:02:44.049> when<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.260> bought

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
home and six years ago when I bought

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.830 
home and six years ago when I bought
this<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.739> think<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.010> was<00:02:45.159> 150<00:02:45.879> or<00:02:45.940> 170<00:02:46.659> and<00:02:46.780> I

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
this I think it was 150 or 170 and I

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.030 
this I think it was 150 or 170 and I
thought<00:02:47.019> oh<00:02:47.109> my<00:02:47.260> god<00:02:47.440> that's<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.739> great<00:02:47.859> idea

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
thought oh my god that's a great idea

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.800 
thought oh my god that's a great idea
I've<00:02:48.760> been<00:02:49.000> doing<00:02:49.180> these<00:02:49.299> treatments<00:02:49.690> at<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
I've been doing these treatments at the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.569 
I've been doing these treatments at the
dermatologist<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.829> really<00:02:51.099> like<00:02:51.310> them<00:02:51.549> they're

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
dermatologist I really like them they're

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.430 
dermatologist I really like them they're
very<00:02:52.000> expensive<00:02:52.389> at<00:02:52.659> the<00:02:52.690> dermatologist

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
very expensive at the dermatologist

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
very expensive at the dermatologist
because<00:02:53.560> insurance<00:02:53.889> back<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:54.609> didn't<00:02:54.879> cover

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
because insurance back then didn't cover

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.379 
because insurance back then didn't cover
it<00:02:55.239> for<00:02:55.389> me<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.609> I<00:02:57.670> ended<00:02:57.879> up<00:02:57.970> buying<00:02:58.150> this

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
it for me and so I ended up buying this

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.879 
it for me and so I ended up buying this
at<00:02:58.540> home<00:02:58.720> now

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
at home now

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.890 
at home now
as<00:03:00.010> mentioned<00:03:00.879> I<00:03:01.090> probably<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.870> been

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
as mentioned I probably have been

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.379 
as mentioned I probably have been
sitting<00:03:02.349> on<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.739> for<00:03:02.799> five<00:03:03.280> six<00:03:03.609> seven<00:03:03.790> years

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
sitting on this for five six seven years

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.500 
sitting on this for five six seven years
I<00:03:04.720> think<00:03:05.409> I<00:03:05.709> used<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.099> for<00:03:06.250> about<00:03:06.510> probably

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
I think I used it for about probably

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.050 
I think I used it for about probably
eight<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.989> ten<00:03:08.260> months<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.549> was<00:03:09.760> honestly

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
eight to ten months and I was honestly

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.000 
eight to ten months and I was honestly
very<00:03:10.120> disappointed<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:11.019> this<00:03:11.170> now<00:03:11.650> that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
very disappointed with this now that

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.939 
very disappointed with this now that
being<00:03:12.250> said<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.579> is<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.819> only<00:03:12.849> LED<00:03:13.720> lamp<00:03:14.560> or

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
being said this is the only LED lamp or

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.559 
being said this is the only LED lamp or
thing<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.430> I've<00:03:15.519> used<00:03:15.730> outside<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.449> the

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
thing that I've used outside of the

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.360 
thing that I've used outside of the
dermatology<00:03:17.169> offices<00:03:17.620> there<00:03:17.859> are<00:03:17.980> others

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
dermatology offices there are others

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.220 
dermatology offices there are others
that<00:03:18.400> are<00:03:18.699> different<00:03:19.000> brands<00:03:19.299> there<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:19.989> that

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
that are different brands there is that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.599 
that are different brands there is that
you<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.470> actually<00:03:20.769> hold<00:03:20.949> up<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.310> your<00:03:21.400> face

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
you can actually hold up to your face

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.009 
you can actually hold up to your face

and kind of skim the light over your
face<00:03:23.379> I<00:03:23.620> don't<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.370> what<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.549> can't<00:03:24.849> test<00:03:25.180> for

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
face I don't know what I can't test for

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.170 
face I don't know what I can't test for
the<00:03:26.099> effectiveness<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.280> those<00:03:27.519> just<00:03:27.940> because

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
the effectiveness of those just because

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.300 
the effectiveness of those just because
I<00:03:28.269> haven't<00:03:28.449> tried<00:03:28.629> them<00:03:28.840> but<00:03:29.379> for<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.709> out<00:03:30.040> of

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I haven't tried them but for this out of

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.129 
I haven't tried them but for this out of
ten<00:03:30.549> months<00:03:30.699> it<00:03:31.000> did<00:03:31.269> not<00:03:31.389> work<00:03:31.569> for<00:03:31.599> me<00:03:31.840> and

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
ten months it did not work for me and

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.020 
ten months it did not work for me and
basically<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.010> way<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.310> works<00:03:33.609> I'll<00:03:33.819> plug

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
basically the way this works I'll plug

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.150 
basically the way this works I'll plug
it<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.269> for<00:03:34.449> you<00:03:34.629> plug<00:03:35.379> it<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.709> plug<00:03:36.099> it<00:03:36.340> in

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
it in for you plug it in plug it in

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.550 
it in for you plug it in plug it in
basically<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.400> plug<00:03:39.669> this<00:03:39.879> in<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:41.109> put

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
basically you plug this in and you put

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.740 
basically you plug this in and you put
it<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.489> sit<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:42.910> front<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.299> for<00:03:43.329> 30

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it on and you sit in front of it for 30

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.809 
it on and you sit in front of it for 30
minutes<00:03:44.049> or<00:03:44.199> 45<00:03:44.530> minutes<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.099> day<00:03:45.280> or<00:03:45.310> whatever

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
minutes or 45 minutes a day or whatever

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.180 
minutes or 45 minutes a day or whatever
and<00:03:46.629> it's<00:03:46.750> supposed<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.199> kind<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.560> kind<00:03:48.069> of

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
and it's supposed to kind of kind of

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.800 
and it's supposed to kind of kind of
treat<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.579> light<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:49.000> your<00:03:49.180> skin<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.720> they

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
treat the light in your skin and they

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.360 
treat the light in your skin and they
actually<00:03:50.260> give<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.530> little<00:03:50.680> goggles<00:03:51.190> to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
actually give you a little goggles to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.089 
actually give you a little goggles to
wear<00:03:51.569> but<00:03:52.569> somewhere<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.079> read<00:03:53.440> or<00:03:53.739> somewhere<00:03:54.069> I

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
wear but somewhere I read or somewhere I

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.860 
wear but somewhere I read or somewhere I
was<00:03:54.280> told<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.699> you<00:03:54.790> didn't<00:03:55.120> actually<00:03:55.359> need

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
was told that you didn't actually need

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.449 
was told that you didn't actually need
to<00:03:56.109> wear<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.440> little<00:03:56.560> goggles<00:03:57.069> even<00:03:57.370> though

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
to wear the little goggles even though

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.949 
to wear the little goggles even though
they<00:03:57.549> are<00:03:57.699> probably<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> good<00:03:58.359> idea<00:03:58.419> cuz<00:03:58.810> these

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
they are probably a good idea cuz these

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.229 
they are probably a good idea cuz these
are<00:03:59.109> bright<00:03:59.319> lights<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.069> it's<00:04:00.760> supposed<00:04:01.120> to

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
are bright lights and it's supposed to

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.149 
are bright lights and it's supposed to

this<00:04:03.609> was<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.879> total<00:04:04.329> joke<00:04:04.599> it<00:04:04.840> did<00:04:04.989> not<00:04:05.139> shoot

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
this was a total joke it did not shoot

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.530 
this was a total joke it did not shoot
anything<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.949> not<00:04:06.159> help<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.489> my<00:04:06.609> acne<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.359> did

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
anything it not help out my acne it did

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.969 
anything it not help out my acne it did
not<00:04:07.720> make<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> difference<00:04:08.379> in<00:04:08.500> my<00:04:08.620> skin<00:04:08.949> I

not make a difference in my skin I
didn't<00:04:09.340> see<00:04:09.489> more<00:04:09.669> drying<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.299> didn't<00:04:10.540> see<00:04:10.690> more

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
didn't see more drying I didn't see more

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.219 
didn't see more drying I didn't see more
healing<00:04:11.379> any<00:04:11.979> of<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.549> back<00:04:12.879> then<00:04:13.120> my<00:04:13.840> acne

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
healing any of that back then my acne

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.319 
healing any of that back then my acne
was<00:04:14.409> much<00:04:14.739> more<00:04:14.979> severe<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.669> had<00:04:15.909> lots<00:04:16.180> of

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
was much more severe I had lots of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.180 
was much more severe I had lots of
cystic<00:04:16.780> acne<00:04:16.930> especially<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:17.859> believe

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
cystic acne especially that I believe

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.560 
cystic acne especially that I believe
was

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
was

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.100 
was
induced<00:04:19.430> lots<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.580> pustules<00:04:21.270> even<00:04:21.840> lots<00:04:21.990> of

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
induced lots of pustules even lots of

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.720 
induced lots of pustules even lots of
closed<00:04:22.320> Tacoma<00:04:22.620> domes<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.010> even<00:04:23.220> some<00:04:23.400> Melia

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
closed Tacoma domes and even some Melia

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.970 
closed Tacoma domes and even some Melia
and<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.420> absolutely<00:04:24.930> did<00:04:25.140> nothing<00:04:25.620> for<00:04:25.650> me

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
and it absolutely did nothing for me

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.530 
and it absolutely did nothing for me
that<00:04:26.490> being<00:04:26.730> said<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> treatments<00:04:27.390> that<00:04:27.450> I

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
that being said the treatments that I

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.090 
that being said the treatments that I
did<00:04:27.720> at<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> dermatologists<00:04:28.710> were<00:04:28.890> very

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
did at the dermatologists were very

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.980 
did at the dermatologists were very
affect<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.580> later<00:04:29.880> on<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.360> did<00:04:30.570> get<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.780> bit

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
affect it so later on I did get a bit

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.990 
affect it so later on I did get a bit
curious<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.710> was<00:04:31.860> wondering<00:04:32.340> why<00:04:32.580> didn't

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
curious and I was wondering why didn't

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.230 
curious and I was wondering why didn't
this<00:04:33.180> work<00:04:33.860> versus<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.100> other<00:04:35.280> ones<00:04:35.610> at<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
this work versus the other ones at the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.060 
this work versus the other ones at the
dermatology<00:04:36.930> office<00:04:37.320> or<00:04:37.530> some<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.920> other

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
dermatology office or some of the other

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.770 
dermatology office or some of the other
handheld<00:04:38.550> devices<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.120> people<00:04:39.270> claimed

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
handheld devices that people claimed

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.080 
handheld devices that people claimed
work<00:04:40.050> really<00:04:40.320> well<00:04:40.590> did<00:04:40.830> they<00:04:40.950> use<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.850> I

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
work really well did they use and I

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.850 
work really well did they use and I
found<00:04:42.390> out<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.840> sometimes<00:04:43.440> when<00:04:43.710> you

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
found out that sometimes when you

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.830 
found out that sometimes when you
purchase<00:04:44.280> these<00:04:44.400> at<00:04:44.580> home<00:04:44.850> machines<00:04:45.330> the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
purchase these at home machines the

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.720 
purchase these at home machines the
actual<00:04:46.230> difference<00:04:46.590> is<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.920> LED<00:04:47.220> bulbs

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
actual difference is in the LED bulbs

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.150 
actual difference is in the LED bulbs
and<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.000> wavelength<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.870> like<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:49.950> mentioned

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
and the wavelength so like we mentioned

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.250 
and the wavelength so like we mentioned
there<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.640> a<00:04:50.670> certain<00:04:51.060> wavelength<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:52.050> makes

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
there is a certain wavelength that makes

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.080 
there is a certain wavelength that makes
up<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.530> color<00:04:52.740> red<00:04:53.070> which<00:04:53.640> helps<00:04:54.000> it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
up the color red which helps it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.480 
up the color red which helps it
penetrate<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.690> skin<00:04:54.960> correctly<00:04:55.410> well<00:04:56.220> if

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
penetrate the skin correctly well if

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.430 
penetrate the skin correctly well if
that<00:04:56.670> wavelength<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.420> not<00:04:57.630> powerful<00:04:58.110> enough

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
that wavelength is not powerful enough

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.860 
that wavelength is not powerful enough
or<00:04:58.920> if<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.280> not<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.640> right<00:04:59.940> wavelength<00:05:00.390> of

be more pink Reds there could be more

some other home systems that are

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
actually real they do have the right

actually real they do have the right
wavelength<00:05:35.220> of<00:05:35.670> red<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.180> actually<00:05:36.510> penetrate

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
wavelength of red and actually penetrate

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.200 
wavelength of red and actually penetrate
the<00:05:37.050> skin<00:05:37.320> so<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:38.400> reason<00:05:38.730> that<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.880> believe<00:05:39.090> a

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
the skin so the reason that I believe a

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.120 
the skin so the reason that I believe a
lot<00:05:39.420> of<00:05:39.540> these<00:05:39.660> are<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:39.990> scam<00:05:40.410> is<00:05:40.590> because<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.890> lot

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
lot of these are a scam is because a lot

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.890 
lot of these are a scam is because a lot
of<00:05:41.190> them<00:05:41.430> that<00:05:41.550> I've<00:05:41.670> looked<00:05:41.850> at<00:05:42.090> don't<00:05:42.690> seem

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
of them that I've looked at don't seem

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.690

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
this is the clear wave I personally

of my personal use and also if you look
at<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.850> clinical<00:06:09.210> trials<00:06:09.540> they're<00:06:09.660> like<00:06:09.780> oh

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
at the clinical trials they're like oh

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.810 
at the clinical trials they're like oh
