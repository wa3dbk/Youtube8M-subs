00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
get some rain or start watering and it

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
really green up the lawn and then you

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.340 
really green up the lawn and then you
can<00:01:06.399> get<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.550> good<00:01:06.789> handle<00:01:07.119> on<00:01:07.479> how<00:01:07.929> much<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.170> the

go<00:01:22.330> into<00:01:22.600> how<00:01:22.720> well<00:01:22.960> your<00:01:23.140> lawn<00:01:23.320> has<00:01:23.440> survived

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
go into how well your lawn has survived

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.160 
go into how well your lawn has survived
and<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.700> there's<00:01:25.090> only<00:01:25.210> one<00:01:25.330> good<00:01:25.690> way<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.869> tell

and so there's only one good way to tell

and so there's only one good way to tell
how<00:01:26.259> your<00:01:26.409> lawn<00:01:26.530> survived<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.070> that's<00:01:27.190> why

how your lawn survived and that's why

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.370 
how your lawn survived and that's why
start<00:01:27.610> by<00:01:28.000> start<00:01:28.479> irrigating<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.200> and

start by start irrigating it and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.979 
start by start irrigating it and
bringing<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.130> back<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.479> once<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.780> get<00:01:31.869> the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:31.989 
bringing it back so once you get the

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:33.889 
bringing it back so once you get the
lawn<00:01:32.140> back<00:01:32.410> green<00:01:32.739> as<00:01:33.039> best<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.369> can

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
lawn back green as best you can

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.919 
lawn back green as best you can
there's<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:34.989> decision<00:01:35.590> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.880> have<00:01:37.239> very<00:01:37.690> very

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
there's a decision if you have very very

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.380 
there's a decision if you have very very
few<00:01:38.349> thin<00:01:38.830> areas<00:01:39.310> then<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:39.970> can<00:01:40.209> probably

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
few thin areas then you can probably

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.120 
few thin areas then you can probably
