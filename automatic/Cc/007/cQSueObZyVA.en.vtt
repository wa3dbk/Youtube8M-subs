here slides in here on the hinge pin and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
here slides in here on the hinge pin and
there's<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> pre-existing<00:00:34.530> hole<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.340> there

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
there's a pre-existing hole right there

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.930 
there's a pre-existing hole right there
that<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> line<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.670> it<00:00:38.670> comes

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that you want to line up for it it comes

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.610 
that you want to line up for it it comes
with<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> screw<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.809> nut<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.559> there

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
with a screw and nut to put it on there

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
with a screw and nut to put it on there
blew<00:00:43.620> through<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> nut<00:00:45.300> on

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
blew through there and then the nut on

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:59.100 
blew through there and then the nut on
the<00:00:45.629> top<00:00:45.719> side

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.810 

down<00:01:00.110> you'll<00:01:00.350> be<00:01:00.440> set<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.770> go<00:01:00.800> okay<00:01:01.340> once<00:01:01.700> we

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
down you'll be set to go okay once we

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.069 
down you'll be set to go okay once we
clean<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.180> plate<00:01:02.390> we're<00:01:02.660> going<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:02.870> attach

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
clean the plate we're going to attach

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.079 
clean the plate we're going to attach
the<00:01:03.110> sensor<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.489> goes<00:01:04.699> right<00:01:04.850> up<00:01:04.970> it

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
the sensor to it it goes right up it

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.940 
the sensor to it it goes right up it
gives<00:01:05.239> this<00:01:05.390> edge<00:01:05.630> here<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.680> your<00:01:06.800> arm

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
gives this edge here with your arm

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.040 
gives this edge here with your arm
folded<00:01:07.280> forward<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.000> it'll<00:01:08.240> move<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.930> you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
folded forward so it'll move and you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.270 
folded forward so it'll move and you
need<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.260> be<00:01:09.380> sure<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.620> get<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:09.920> under<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
need to be sure to get it under the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:25.230 
need to be sure to get it under the
wires

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.910 

okay<00:01:26.240> once<00:01:26.630> we've<00:01:26.780> got<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:26.990> installed<00:01:27.470> we're

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
okay once we've got that installed we're

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.470 
okay once we've got that installed we're
going<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.130> run<00:01:28.250> our<00:01:28.370> wire<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.850> hook<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.240> up<00:01:29.330> to

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
going to run our wire and hook it up to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.620 
going to run our wire and hook it up to

then all we need to do is bundle up our
wires<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.290> mount<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> transducer<00:02:33.130> itself

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
wires and mount the transducer itself

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.190 
wires and mount the transducer itself
we've<00:02:33.550> got<00:02:33.640> all<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> wires<00:02:34.090> around<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:35.170> need

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
we've got all the wires around we need

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.770 
we've got all the wires around we need
to<00:02:35.380> hook<00:02:35.470> up<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.940> transducer<00:02:36.940> side<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.510> then

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to hook up the transducer side and then

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.510 
to hook up the transducer side and then
our<00:02:37.870> structure<00:02:38.260> scan<00:02:38.350> connector<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.340> we're

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
our structure scan connector and we're

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.340 
our structure scan connector and we're
all<00:02:39.610> set<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.880> put<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.210> back<00:02:40.330> together<00:02:40.480> when

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
all set to put it all back together when

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.720 
all set to put it all back together when
we<00:02:41.410> mount<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.740> transducer<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.460> got<00:02:42.580> these

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
we mount the transducer it's got these

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.460 
we mount the transducer it's got these
two<00:02:42.910> notches<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.050> you've<00:02:44.170> got<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.320> make

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
two notches on it and you've got to make

tomorrow in the water calibration once
we've<00:02:57.550> updated<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.000> unit<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> current

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
we've updated the unit to the current

select the correct correct transducer in

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.360 
select the correct correct transducer in
this<00:04:00.850> case<00:04:01.120> we<00:04:01.900> need<00:04:02.140> one<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.950> HDI

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
this case we need one of the HDI

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.760 
this case we need one of the HDI
transducers<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.290> we've<00:04:05.410> got<00:04:05.560> down
