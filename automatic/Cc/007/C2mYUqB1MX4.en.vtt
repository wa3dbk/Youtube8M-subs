the air conditioning kicks on in the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.560 
the air conditioning kicks on in the
house<00:00:57.489> causes<00:00:58.489> some<00:00:58.609> drafts<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.480> was

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
house causes some drafts and I was

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.410 
house causes some drafts and I was
having<00:00:59.809> some<00:00:59.929> problems<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:00.620> for<00:01:01.219> right<00:01:01.309> now

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
having some problems so for right now

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.030 
having some problems so for right now
that<00:01:02.420> seems<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:02.780> help<00:01:02.929> in<00:01:03.260> fact<00:01:03.440> it<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:03.679> helping

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
that seems to help in fact it is helping

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.399 
that seems to help in fact it is helping
and<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.210> what's<00:01:05.360> going<00:01:05.600> on<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.170> there's

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
and so what's going on here is there's

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.300 
and so what's going on here is there's
two<00:01:07.780> extruders<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:09.470> can<00:01:09.650> see<00:01:09.799> there's<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.100> left

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
two extruders you can see there's a left

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.090 
two extruders you can see there's a left
and<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.490> right<00:01:10.520> each<00:01:10.939> as<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.270> fan<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.890> each<00:01:12.890> one

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
and a right each as a fan and each one

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.020 
and a right each as a fan and each one
has<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.250> feed<00:01:13.549> tube<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.900> thinner<00:01:15.380> black<00:01:16.030> line

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
has a feed tube is a thinner black line

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.600 
has a feed tube is a thinner black line
there's<00:01:17.329> one<00:01:17.600> there<00:01:17.840> on<00:01:18.500> here<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.430> middle

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
there's one there on here in the middle

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.639 
there's one there on here in the middle
the<00:01:19.880> thicker<00:01:20.090> cable<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.079> bundle<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.530> wires

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
the thicker cable is a bundle of wires

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.429 
the thicker cable is a bundle of wires
that<00:01:22.070> goes<00:01:22.310> down<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:23.930> can<00:01:24.049> see<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.290> wires

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
that goes down you can see the wires

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.270 
that goes down you can see the wires
coming<00:01:24.770> out<00:01:24.920> there<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.000> there's<00:01:26.270> two<00:01:27.280> feed

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
coming out there so there's two feed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.160 
coming out there so there's two feed
tubes<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.759> are<00:01:28.820> feeding<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.270> extruders<00:01:29.780> and

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
tubes that are feeding the extruders and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.039 
tubes that are feeding the extruders and
those<00:01:30.829> run<00:01:31.100> around<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.640> back<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
those run around to the back and in the

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.270 
those run around to the back and in the
back<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.469> where<00:01:33.619> we<00:01:33.710> have<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.040> plastic

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
back is where we have the plastic

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.240 
back is where we have the plastic
filament<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.090> there's<00:01:35.450> two<00:01:35.659> spools<00:01:36.250> right

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
filament and there's two spools right

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.590 
filament and there's two spools right
now<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.430> have<00:01:37.579> a<00:01:37.729> yellow<00:01:37.939> one<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.390> black<00:01:38.540> one

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
now I have a yellow one and a black one

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.350 
now I have a yellow one and a black one
loaded<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:40.130> right<00:01:40.700> now<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.909> black<00:01:41.180> is

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
loaded and right now the black is

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.490 
loaded and right now the black is
printing<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.649> can<00:01:42.860> see<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.219> black

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
printing and so you can see this black

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.929 
printing and so you can see this black
objects<00:01:45.500> being<00:01:45.680> made<00:01:45.890> there<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.820> that's

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
objects being made there and that's

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.510 
objects being made there and that's
coming<00:01:47.240> off<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.509> left<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.950> left<00:01:48.979> extruder

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
coming off the left the left extruder

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520 
coming off the left the left extruder
right<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.420> when<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:50.719> run<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> software<00:01:51.229> i

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
right now and when I run the software i

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.760 
right now and when I run the software i
tell<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.860> which<00:01:51.950> extruder<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.520> use<00:01:53.740> right<00:01:54.740> now

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
tell it which extruder to use right now

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.130 
tell it which extruder to use right now
I'm<00:01:54.950> building<00:01:55.310> some<00:01:56.060> parts<00:01:56.360> for<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.539> kit<00:01:56.899> to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
I'm building some parts for a kit to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.099 
I'm building some parts for a kit to

but<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.900> can<00:02:54.020> make<00:02:54.140> functional<00:02:54.380> items<00:02:54.920> as

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
but you can make functional items as

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.740 
but you can make functional items as
well<00:02:55.130> as<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.520> little<00:02:55.730> little<00:02:56.090> toy<00:02:56.240> type<00:02:56.510> thing
