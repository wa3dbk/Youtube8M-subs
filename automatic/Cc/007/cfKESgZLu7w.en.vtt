00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
look it's kind of ruddy it went from a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.550 
look it's kind of ruddy it went from a
131<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.670> pro<00:00:35.910> practice<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> 137

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
131 in the first pro practice to a 137

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.680 
131 in the first pro practice to a 137
in<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.770> second<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.310> so<00:00:38.970> every<00:00:39.270> guy<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.630> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
in the second one so every guy that I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.300 
in the second one so every guy that I
talked<00:00:39.990> to<00:00:40.020> said<00:00:40.380> it's<00:00:40.410> getting<00:00:40.740> rougher<00:00:41.130> and

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
talked to said it's getting rougher and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.490 
talked to said it's getting rougher and
rougher<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.030> tougher<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.570> tougher<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:43.110> think

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
rougher and tougher and tougher I think

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
rougher and tougher and tougher I think
the<00:00:43.590> ruts<00:00:43.800> should<00:00:44.070> maybe<00:00:44.250> make<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> check<00:00:44.850> up

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the ruts should maybe make the check up

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
the ruts should maybe make the check up
faster<00:00:45.450> no<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.380> there's<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:46.800> off

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
faster no because there's some off

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.700 
faster no because there's some off
cameras<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.400> there<00:00:47.430> no

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710

ago<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.200> he<00:01:12.290> was<00:01:12.320> old<00:01:12.560> then<00:01:12.710> tell<00:01:13.430> me<00:01:13.460> about<00:01:13.580> he

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
ago and he was old then tell me about he

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.100 
ago and he was old then tell me about he
was<00:01:13.909> here<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.210> first<00:01:14.420> time<00:01:14.570> they<00:01:14.720> raced<00:01:14.899> here

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
was here the first time they raced here

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.760 
was here the first time they raced here
and<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:17.060> was<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:17.930> grass<00:01:18.140> field<00:01:18.350> that's<00:01:18.590> all

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
and it was just a grass field that's all

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.840 
and it was just a grass field that's all
the<00:01:18.830> work<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.100> they<00:01:19.220> read<00:01:19.399> through<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.700> grass

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
the work and they read through the grass

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.130 
the work and they read through the grass
that's<00:01:20.060> how<00:01:20.149> they<00:01:20.300> designed<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.659> track<00:01:20.869> yep

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
that's how they designed the track yep

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.340 
that's how they designed the track yep
so<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.190> guess<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:23.330> just<00:01:23.360> went<00:01:23.600> back<00:01:23.720> 40<00:01:24.110> years<00:01:24.289> in

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
so I guess we just went back 40 years in

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.499 
so I guess we just went back 40 years in
