00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
of quick tips and tricks I do think it's

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.400 
of quick tips and tricks I do think it's
pretty<00:05:38.979> easy<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.520> find<00:05:40.150> your<00:05:40.419> style<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:41.139> might

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
pretty easy to find your style it might

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.260 
pretty easy to find your style it might
be<00:05:41.650> processed<00:05:42.220> so<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.490> might<00:05:42.639> take<00:05:42.669> you<00:05:43.090> awhile

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
be processed so it might take you awhile

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.540 
be processed so it might take you awhile
but<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.080> really<00:05:44.530> think<00:05:44.710> if<00:05:44.889> you<00:05:44.979> start<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.400> look

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
but I really think if you start to look

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.210 
but I really think if you start to look
at<00:05:45.729> what<00:05:46.060> around<00:05:46.539> you<00:05:46.840> is<00:05:47.050> inspiring<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.919> the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
at what around you is inspiring you the

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.010 
at what around you is inspiring you the
things<00:05:48.520> that<00:05:48.729> you<00:05:48.849> buy<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.509> decorate<00:05:49.870> your
