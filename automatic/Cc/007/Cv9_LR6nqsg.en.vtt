today<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.050> want<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.530> speak<00:00:01.829> briefly<00:00:02.070> on<00:00:02.970> the

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
today I want to speak briefly on the

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.940 
today I want to speak briefly on the
topic<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.130> fingering<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:06.710> when<00:00:07.710> we're

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
topic of fingering and when we're

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.870 
topic of fingering and when we're
playing<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.460> seven<00:00:08.849> notes<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.050> scale<00:00:10.880> we

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
playing the seven notes of the scale we

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.169 
playing the seven notes of the scale we
divide<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.420> into<00:00:12.630> four<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.290> three<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
divide it into four and three that is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.740 
divide it into four and three that is
four<00:00:15.809> fingers<00:00:16.730> play<00:00:17.730> four<00:00:18.029> notes<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.630> then

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
four fingers play four notes and then

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.529 
four fingers play four notes and then
three<00:00:19.080> play<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> others<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> case<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
three play the others now in the case of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.130 
three play the others now in the case of
the<00:00:21.689> C<00:00:22.050> major<00:00:22.289> scale<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.449> not<00:00:24.449> really

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the C major scale it's not really

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.490 
the C major scale it's not really
critical<00:00:26.180> whether<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.420> place<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> four

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
critical whether you place the four

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.930 
critical whether you place the four
first<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.179> three<00:00:30.510> first<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.679> example<00:00:32.369> let

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
first or the three first for example let

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.910 
first or the three first for example let
us<00:00:33.120> place<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.960> three<00:00:34.230> first<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:35.840> C<00:00:36.840> D<00:00:37.559> E

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
us place the three first we go C D E

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.030 
us place the three first we go C D E
then<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.090> bring<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.660> thumb<00:00:39.989> underneath<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
then we bring the thumb underneath and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
then we bring the thumb underneath and
we<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.879> F<00:00:42.500> G<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.969> B<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.140> we've<00:00:46.350> used

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
we go F G a B so we see that we've used

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.330 
we go F G a B so we see that we've used
four<00:00:47.039> fingers<00:00:47.520> F<00:00:47.730> G<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> B<00:00:48.710> after<00:00:49.710> we've<00:00:50.010> used

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
four fingers F G a B after we've used

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.529 
four fingers F G a B after we've used
the<00:00:51.030> first<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:51.870> four<00:00:52.680> C<00:00:53.100> D<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.370> E<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.420> we

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the first three four C D and E but we

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.560 
the first three four C D and E but we
could<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.260> four<00:00:55.680> first<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.760> three<00:00:57.059> after

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
could also do four first and three after

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.990 
could also do four first and three after
because<00:00:57.960> where<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.190> dealing<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.579> all

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
because where we are dealing with all

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.349 
because where we are dealing with all
white<00:01:00.359> notes<00:01:00.980> spacing<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> problem<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
white notes spacing is not a problem so

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.280 
white notes spacing is not a problem so
I<00:01:03.390> could<00:01:03.809> go<00:01:04.019> c<00:01:04.500> d<00:01:04.949> e<00:01:05.280> f<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.659> bring<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I could go c d e f and then bring the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.820 
I could go c d e f and then bring the
thumb<00:01:07.590> underneath<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:09.420> G<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.140> B<00:01:10.799> C<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:12.439> G<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> B

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
thumb underneath and go G a B C or G a B

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
thumb underneath and go G a B C or G a B
actually<00:01:14.070> cos<00:01:14.520> C<00:01:14.700> repeats<00:01:15.119> okay<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.500> we're

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
actually cos C repeats okay so we're

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
actually cos C repeats okay so we're
always<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.909> bring<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> thumb

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
always going to have to bring the thumb

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.350 
always going to have to bring the thumb
underneath<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.650> tattoos<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
underneath this tattoos to go up to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.070 
underneath this tattoos to go up to
another<00:01:21.479> octave<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.159> example<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.970> would<00:01:24.540> go

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
another octave so for example I would go

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
another octave so for example I would go

like<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.900> ok<00:02:04.640> now<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:06.270> happens<00:02:06.689> when<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.049> move

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
like so ok now what happens when we move

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.620 
like so ok now what happens when we move
to<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.830> skills<00:02:08.959> involving<00:02:09.959> black<00:02:10.770> notes<00:02:11.160> is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
to the skills involving black notes is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.630 
to the skills involving black notes is
that<00:02:12.860> because<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> spacing<00:02:14.670> between<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that because the spacing between the the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.100 
that because the spacing between the the
arrangement<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.360> keyboard<00:02:18.720> shows<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
arrangement of the keyboard shows that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.660 
arrangement of the keyboard shows that
you<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.380> spacing<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.100> 3<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.520> then<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
you have a spacing of 3 and then a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.809 
you have a spacing of 3 and then a
spacing<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.360> 2<00:02:21.569> with<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> wider<00:02:22.050> space<00:02:22.470> hair<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
spacing of 2 with a wider space hair the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.720 
spacing of 2 with a wider space hair the
fingering<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.959> pretty<00:02:25.200> much

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
fingering is going to be pretty much

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.890 
fingering is going to be pretty much
determined<00:02:26.730> by<00:02:26.970> what<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.569> accomplish

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
determined by what you can accomplish

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.550 
determined by what you can accomplish
with<00:02:28.350> your<00:02:28.560> hand<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.250> therefore<00:02:30.209> it's<00:02:30.900> not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
with your hand and therefore it's not
