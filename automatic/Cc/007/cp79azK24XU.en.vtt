00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169 
d100 which I've been using for a few
years<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.529> let's<00:00:28.710> break<00:00:28.859> into<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.490> box

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
years so let's break into this thing box

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
years so let's break into this thing box
is<00:00:30.420> fairly<00:00:30.689> simple<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> whole<00:00:32.040> lot<00:00:32.250> going

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is fairly simple and a whole lot going

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
is fairly simple and a whole lot going
on<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.540> does<00:00:33.750> point<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
on here that does point out that it is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.940 
on here that does point out that it is
bluetooth<00:00:34.950> version<00:00:35.219> 3<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.120> has<00:00:36.600> super<00:00:37.290> bass<00:00:37.469> a

bluetooth version 3 it has super bass a
microphone<00:00:38.730> built-in<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> guess<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> could

apparently you can't use this as a
speakerphone<00:02:14.810> right<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.200> hadn't

read<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.710> box<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.160> probably<00:02:17.400> would<00:02:17.610> have

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
read the box I probably would have

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.900 
read the box I probably would have
missed<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.950> because<00:02:19.950> besides<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.580> user's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
missed this because besides the user's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.940 
missed this because besides the user's

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
non-slip pads so non-slip it's hard to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.820 
non-slip pads so non-slip it's hard to
get<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.020> plastic<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.560> grabbing

go
fancy<00:02:38.790> let's<00:02:39.660> try<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:40.070> all<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.340> I've

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
fancy let's try it out all right so I've

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.950 
fancy let's try it out all right so I've
got<00:02:41.460> some<00:02:41.700> music<00:02:41.850> cued<00:02:42.240> up<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:42.810> iPad

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
got some music cued up here on my iPad

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.980 
got some music cued up here on my iPad
and<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:43.860> paired<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.640> what<00:02:45.270> I'm<00:02:45.360> gonna<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.780> is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
and it is paired so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.860 
and it is paired so what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:02:46.170> point<00:02:46.920> my<00:02:47.370> lavalier<00:02:47.880> mic<00:02:48.120> towards

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
actually point my lavalier mic towards

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.320 
actually point my lavalier mic towards
this<00:02:49.050> device<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.670> two<00:02:51.000> feet<00:02:51.210> away

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
this device but you know two feet away

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.760 
this device but you know two feet away
from<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.690> about<00:02:51.930> how<00:02:52.080> far<00:02:52.290> I'm<00:02:52.410> sitting<00:02:52.650> now

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
from it about how far I'm sitting now

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.920 
from it about how far I'm sitting now
and<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.190> play<00:02:53.940> some<00:02:54.180> music<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.810> get

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
and just play some music so you can get

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.630 
and just play some music so you can get
an<00:02:54.990> idea<00:02:55.230> how<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.500> sounds<00:02:55.830> at<00:02:55.920> full<00:02:56.100> volume<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
an idea how it sounds at full volume and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.490 
an idea how it sounds at full volume and
then<00:02:57.360> we'll<00:02:57.480> compare<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> creative

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
then we'll compare it to the creative

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:22.470 
then we'll compare it to the creative
d100<00:02:59.100> which<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> much<00:02:59.730> much<00:03:00.090> larger

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.670 

all<00:03:23.480> right<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.870> was<00:03:23.960> about<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.290> know<00:03:24.350> 20

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
all right so that was about you know 20

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.990 
all right so that was about you know 20
seconds<00:03:24.980> were<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.130> audio<00:03:25.370> there<00:03:25.580> on<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:25.940> a

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
seconds were the audio there on just a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.900 
seconds were the audio there on just a
nice<00:03:26.710> instrumental<00:03:27.710> heavy<00:03:28.040> guitar<00:03:28.460> kind<00:03:28.820> of

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
nice instrumental heavy guitar kind of

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.750 
nice instrumental heavy guitar kind of
track<00:03:29.150> their<00:03:29.830> acoustical<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.040> could<00:03:31.190> say<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
track their acoustical you could say and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.790 
track their acoustical you could say and
now<00:03:32.270> let's<00:03:32.570> change<00:03:32.990> things<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.560> bit<00:03:33.590> get

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
now let's change things up a bit get

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:56.710 
now let's change things up a bit get
something<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.100> little<00:03:34.280> more<00:03:34.310> bass<00:03:34.670> heavy

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.670 

all<00:03:57.720> right<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.020> as<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.170> can<00:03:58.260> hear<00:03:58.470> they're

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
all right so as you can hear they're

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.220 
all right so as you can hear they're
definitely<00:03:59.580> pumping<00:04:00.360> out<00:04:00.480> some<00:04:00.630> sound<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.170> as

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
definitely pumping out some sound for as

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.800 
definitely pumping out some sound for as
small<00:04:01.470> as<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.830> not<00:04:02.310> quite<00:04:02.819> as<00:04:03.000> loud<00:04:03.209> as<00:04:03.540> you

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
small as it is not quite as loud as you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.290

something that I've seen a lot of other
Bluetooth<00:04:09.990> little<00:04:10.680> capsule<00:04:11.900> speakers<00:04:12.900> not<00:04:13.290> do

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
Bluetooth little capsule speakers not do

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.410 
Bluetooth little capsule speakers not do
well<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.550> is<00:04:14.670> they<00:04:14.820> allow<00:04:15.000> them<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.300> get

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
well and that is they allow them to get

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.240 
well and that is they allow them to get
too<00:04:15.630> loud<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.169> they<00:04:16.230> need<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.530> store<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.070> this

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
too loud and they need to store it this

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.710 
too loud and they need to store it this
one<00:04:17.430> seems<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.820> cut<00:04:17.970> off<00:04:18.120> before<00:04:18.510> it's<00:04:18.600> gonna

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
one seems to cut off before it's gonna

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.900 
one seems to cut off before it's gonna
do<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.440> that's<00:04:19.980> something<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.340> can't<00:04:20.640> say

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
do that and that's something I can't say

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.670 
do that and that's something I can't say
about<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.269> creative<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.750> does<00:04:21.989> distort<00:04:22.440> from

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
about the creative it does distort from

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.230 
about the creative it does distort from
time<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.950> time<00:04:22.980> so<00:04:23.340> speaking<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.880> creative

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
time to time so speaking of the creative

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.420 
time to time so speaking of the creative
let's<00:04:24.900> do<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.200> same<00:04:25.350> test<00:04:25.650> again<00:04:25.919> on<00:04:26.130> that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
let's do the same test again on that

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.040 
let's do the same test again on that
alright<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.120> I've<00:04:27.270> got<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.480> creative<00:04:27.870> hooked

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
alright so I've got the creative hooked

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.590 
alright so I've got the creative hooked
up<00:04:28.230> now<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:28.830> synced<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.460> it's<00:04:29.880> time<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.360> do

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
up now it is synced and it's time to do

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.090 
up now it is synced and it's time to do
a<00:04:30.630> comparison<00:04:31.050> now<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.410> see<00:04:31.590> here

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
a comparison now you can see here

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.270 
a comparison now you can see here
size-wise<00:04:32.700> huge<00:04:33.690> difference<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.650> of<00:04:35.220> course

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
size-wise huge difference and of course

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.159 
size-wise huge difference and of course
there's<00:04:35.760> gonna<00:04:36.000> be<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> big<00:04:36.720> difference<00:04:36.900> in

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
there's gonna be a big difference in

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.330 
there's gonna be a big difference in
sound<00:04:37.380> as<00:04:37.500> well<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.800> I'll<00:04:37.890> go<00:04:38.010> ahead<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.250> play

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
sound as well so I'll go ahead and play

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.040 
sound as well so I'll go ahead and play
the<00:04:38.520> same<00:04:38.700> two<00:04:38.940> tracks<00:04:39.270> royalty-free<00:04:39.750> of

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the same two tracks royalty-free of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.560 
the same two tracks royalty-free of
course<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.500> then<00:04:41.100> I'll<00:04:41.640> do<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.880> comparison

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
course and then I'll do a comparison

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.120 
course and then I'll do a comparison
with<00:04:42.630> them<00:04:42.780> side-by-side<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.710> really<00:04:43.950> help

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
with them side-by-side to really help

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.280 
with them side-by-side to really help
you<00:04:44.190> get<00:04:44.310> an<00:04:44.430> idea<00:04:44.520> same<00:04:45.360> test<00:04:45.660> microphone<00:04:46.200> in

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
you get an idea same test microphone in

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.860 
you get an idea same test microphone in
the<00:04:46.350> same<00:04:46.530> position<00:04:47.090> everything<00:04:48.090> volume<00:04:48.660> at

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
the same position everything volume at

00:04:48.870 --> 00:05:10.920 
the same position everything volume at
max

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.719 

all<00:05:11.710> right<00:05:11.830> soon<00:05:12.009> as<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:12.130> get<00:05:12.220> here<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:12.430> was

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
all right soon as you get here that was

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.909 
all right soon as you get here that was
definitely<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.300> lot<00:05:13.660> louder<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.350> there<00:05:14.800> was<00:05:14.889> a

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
definitely a lot louder and there was a

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.620 
definitely a lot louder and there was a
lot<00:05:15.160> more<00:05:15.190> bass<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:15.789> of<00:05:16.000> course<00:05:16.330> there<00:05:16.509> was

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
lot more bass but of course there was

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:40.090 
lot more bass but of course there was
it's<00:05:16.870> bigger<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.199> now<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.889> Basie<00:05:18.190> track

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.710 

all<00:05:41.100> right<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:41.730> as<00:05:41.820> you<00:05:41.970> could<00:05:42.150> hear<00:05:42.450> there's

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
all right so as you could hear there's

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.750 
all right so as you could hear there's
definitely<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.320> big<00:05:43.830> sound<00:05:44.190> difference<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:44.730> I

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
definitely a big sound difference and I

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.920 
definitely a big sound difference and I
don't<00:05:44.850> know<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.270> carry<00:05:45.450> through<00:05:45.690> as<00:05:45.780> well

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
don't know if it carry through as well

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.080 
don't know if it carry through as well
into<00:05:46.140> the<00:05:46.230> mic<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.650> did<00:05:46.920> is<00:05:47.190> in<00:05:47.370> real<00:05:47.550> life<00:05:47.610> but

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
into the mic so did is in real life but

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.060 
into the mic so did is in real life but
it<00:05:48.240> was<00:05:48.270> huge<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:49.260> creative<00:05:49.530> puts<00:05:49.710> out<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.860> lot

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
it was huge the creative puts out a lot

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.670 
it was huge the creative puts out a lot
deeper<00:05:50.400> sound<00:05:50.850> and<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.990> lot<00:05:52.200> more<00:05:52.470> sound

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
deeper sound and a lot more sound

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.620 
deeper sound and a lot more sound
however<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.100> will<00:05:53.340> say<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.790> sound<00:05:54.060> isn't<00:05:54.360> is

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
however I will say the sound isn't is

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.440 
however I will say the sound isn't is
clear<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.890> audio<00:05:56.370> quality<00:05:56.670> coming<00:05:57.330> out<00:05:57.390> of

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
clear the audio quality coming out of

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.180 
clear the audio quality coming out of
the<00:05:57.600> air<00:05:57.720> capsule<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.380> actually<00:05:58.800> better

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
the air capsule is actually better

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.790 
the air capsule is actually better
overall<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:00.180> more<00:06:00.390> well<00:06:00.570> rounded<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.260> it

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
overall it's more well rounded and it

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.040 
overall it's more well rounded and it
has<00:06:02.010> better<00:06:02.310> mids<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:02.910> highs<00:06:03.000> than<00:06:03.570> the

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
has better mids and highs than the

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.580 
has better mids and highs than the
creative<00:06:04.380> is<00:06:04.500> really<00:06:04.980> heavy<00:06:05.370> in<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.670> mids<00:06:06.000> and

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
creative is really heavy in the mids and

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.720 
creative is really heavy in the mids and
muddles<00:06:07.590> out<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.740> little<00:06:07.950> bit<00:06:08.040> on<00:06:08.160> the<00:06:08.250> bass<00:06:08.430> and

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
muddles out a little bit on the bass and

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.400 
muddles out a little bit on the bass and
really<00:06:09.120> kind<00:06:09.360> of<00:06:09.450> fails<00:06:09.720> in<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:10.020> highs<00:06:10.170> it's

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
really kind of fails in the highs it's

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.260 
really kind of fails in the highs it's
not<00:06:10.590> nearly<00:06:10.830> as<00:06:10.950> good<00:06:11.160> whereas<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.150> air

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
not nearly as good whereas the air

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.690 
not nearly as good whereas the air
capsule<00:06:12.780> has<00:06:12.930> an<00:06:13.080> all-around<00:06:13.620> pretty<00:06:14.070> even

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
capsule has an all-around pretty even

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.210 
capsule has an all-around pretty even
sound<00:06:15.060> so<00:06:15.420> for<00:06:16.020> as<00:06:16.110> small<00:06:16.290> as<00:06:16.680> this<00:06:16.830> little<00:06:17.070> guy

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
sound so for as small as this little guy

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.030 
sound so for as small as this little guy
is<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:18.110> mean<00:06:19.110> you<00:06:19.260> can<00:06:19.380> just<00:06:19.410> chill<00:06:19.710> right<00:06:19.860> up

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
is I mean you can just chill right up

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.760 
is I mean you can just chill right up
there<00:06:20.250> if<00:06:20.460> you<00:06:20.880> have<00:06:21.570> a<00:06:21.600> space<00:06:22.080> restriction

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
there if you have a space restriction

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.030 
there if you have a space restriction
you<00:06:23.100> really<00:06:23.940> can't<00:06:24.330> go<00:06:24.510> wrong<00:06:24.540> for<00:06:25.260> I<00:06:25.320> think<00:06:25.890> I

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
you really can't go wrong for I think I
