00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
[MUSIC]

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.120
My name is Nikki Jean.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.012
I'm a professional
singer/songwriter and

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.960
currently based out
of Los Angeles.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.882
The reality about
getting worse and

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.788
worse at the thing you're
trying to be best at.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.409
Is that, ultimately, you're not
gonna be able to do it anymore.

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:29.369
And for me, I'd spend my whole
life pursuing a career in music.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.735
And I had gotten to this place
where there were major recording

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:36.426
contracts, there were national
tours, there were international

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:39.460
tours, there were all
these things going on.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.576
And none of them were
gonna be possible anymore,

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.324
because I couldn't sing.

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.487
In 2008 I was coming
back on a flight and

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:48.240
I noticed I had
a lump in my throat.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.606
And I went to the doctor,
got it all tested,

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.304
it was determined that I
had nodules in my thyroid.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.308
I had a fine needle aspiration
biopsy that said it was benign

00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:59.600
and I didn't need
to worry about it.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.079
Four years later,

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.895
I was having a really difficult
time swallowing and singing.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:09.300
I was initially diagnosed by an
Endocrinologist in Philadelphia,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.089
who said, oh,
you can leave it in,

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:13.557
you can take it out,
it doesn't really matter.

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:17.012
And I was trying to express to
him the urgency that I felt

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:20.859
not being able to sing, and
me being a professional singer.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.774
I found one woman who was
a professional opera singer and

00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:26.327
she used to say,
you gotta find the best doctor.

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:28.068
And then I found Dr. Tufano

00:01:28.068 --> 00:01:33.966
[MUSIC]

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.365
&gt;&gt; Thyroidectomy is removal
of the thyroid gland, but

00:01:37.365 --> 00:01:39.250
it is much more than that.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.060
Once we get in to
where the thyroid is,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.500
we're concerned about nerves.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.581
Those nerves are the recurrent
laryngeal nerves which control

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:49.967
the focal folds, and

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:53.747
usually are responsible for
your conversational voice.

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:56.870
But there are also smaller
nerves that are on top

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.852
of the thyroid that run along
the superior pole of the thyroid

00:02:00.852 --> 00:02:04.696
that control the vocal folds
elongating and shortening.

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:08.050
And therefore, they control
the pitch of your voice.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.170
Now, that's incredibly
important for singers or

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.760
professional voice users who
rely on pitch changes and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.420
inflection in the voice.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.115
&gt;&gt; I had done so much research
before my appointment.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:22.418
I had kind of a laser beam focus
on this idea of the external

00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:26.429
branch of the superior laryngeal
nerve, because that's the nerve

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.490
that controls your power and
your range.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.362
And I went in, and as I was
talking to Dr. Tufano, I was

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:35.800
like, do you know if they make,
maybe something that can protect

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.198
this nerve too, because I'm very
concerned about this nerve.

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:41.019
And his face kinda lit up.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.208
He said,
that's a really good question.

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:47.580
Turns out Dr. Tufano had been
doing research at that time for

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.302
this brand new sensor.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.170
And so, I was one of the first
people to get to use it.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.810
It's sole purpose is to protect
that third nerve that I was so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.070
concerned about.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.753
And you know, that's just one
of the benefits of going to

00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:05.151
somebody who's at the cutting
edge of their field.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.259
&gt;&gt; There's a lecture that I give
nationally and internationally

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.025
that talks about this nerve
being the forgotten nerve.

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:14.813
In every case, what we do
differently than I think anybody

00:03:14.813 --> 00:03:18.988
else, is look for that nerve,
stimulate that nerve and protect

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:23.109
that nerve, while we are working
on the superior pole vessel.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.020
&gt;&gt; The day the surgery,
they were all awesome.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.520
Coz I was scared out of my mind.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.174
I remember the wonderful nurse
anesthetist that helped me just

00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:38.492
kinda calmed my nerves and
stayed with me before I went in.

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:40.988
And when I came out
the nurses were amazing.

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.859
It's such a team of people
that you constantly feel like

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.090
you're in good hands.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.869
&gt;&gt; I remember coming to see
Nicole in the recovery room

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.472
after surgery and I let her know
that everything went very well.

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:57.402
And that all of those nerves
that we were concerned

00:03:57.402 --> 00:03:58.868
about were preserved and

00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:01.650
working beautifully at
the end of the case.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.480
&gt;&gt; Laying on the table, barely
opening my eyes and him saying,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.737
give me a note, and
me being like [SOUND].

00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:11.729
And it was maybe the ugliest
note that I have ever made, but

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.410
the one I'm most grateful for.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.154
Because I knew at that moment,
that very fuzzy moment,

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.552
that everything
was gonna be okay.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.687
You travel from Philly,
you travel from Minnesota,

00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:25.917
you travel from
wherever to Hopkins,

00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:28.017
because Hopkins is
the best place.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:31.314
It's gonna give you the best
chance to get your best

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:33.543
prognosis and your best outcome.

00:04:33.543 --> 00:04:37.571
Within six months, that's when
they said it would be my full,

00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.173
I'd be all the way back.

00:04:39.173 --> 00:04:41.112
It's like a brand new voice.

00:04:41.112 --> 00:04:46.066
I can sing stronger than I've
maybe ever been able to sing

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:50.097
in my life, and
it's brought such a joy back.

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:54.452
And he is just
a little yellow pill.
