municipal water supply go ahead and turn

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.569 
municipal water supply go ahead and turn
it<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:30.439> alright<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.979> turned<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it on alright so we just turned on the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.210 
it on alright so we just turned on the
water<00:01:32.880> inside<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> house<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.159> now<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
water inside the house and now the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.950 
water inside the house and now the
system<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.700> always<00:01:35.850> pressurized<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
system is always pressurized so it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.020 
system is always pressurized so it's
always<00:01:37.079> ready<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> go

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
always ready to go

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
always ready to go
pretty<00:01:39.030> soon<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.450> pressure<00:01:39.659> pump<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.409> kick

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
pretty soon the pressure pump will kick

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.319 
pretty soon the pressure pump will kick
back<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> draw<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.119> water

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
back on because there is a draw of water

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
back on because there is a draw of water
and<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> will<00:01:43.200> reap<00:01:43.439> rescher<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.920> tank<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and it will reap rescher the tank and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.609 
and it will reap rescher the tank and
that<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.640> cycle<00:01:45.030> through<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.259> right<00:01:46.439> now

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
that little cycle through so right now

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.960 
that little cycle through so right now
the<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.820> got<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> good<00:01:48.180> stream<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.630> there

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
the the you got a good stream in there

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
the the you got a good stream in there
so<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.060> got<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> full<00:01:51.450> stream<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.899> water<00:01:52.079> going

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so we got a full stream of water going

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679

can<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.420> there's<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> kitchen<00:02:07.619> sink

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
can see there's we have the kitchen sink

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.460 
can see there's we have the kitchen sink
open<00:02:08.340> full<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.840> running<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
open full and it's running and the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.330 
open full and it's running and the
system<00:02:10.830> has

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
system has

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.160 
system has
turn<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> pressure<00:02:11.910> pump<00:02:12.269> on<00:02:12.450> yet<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
turn the pressure pump on yet but it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.580 
turn the pressure pump on yet but it
will<00:02:13.319> any<00:02:13.980> second<00:02:14.400> now<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.390> system<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.930> very

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
will any second now the system is very

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.160 
will any second now the system is very
simplistic<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.849> its<00:02:18.060> operation<00:02:18.690> there's<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
simplistic in its operation there's the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.420 
simplistic in its operation there's the
pump<00:02:19.730> pump<00:02:20.730> comes<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.709> refresh<00:02:22.709> arises<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
pump pump comes on refresh arises the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.360 
pump pump comes on refresh arises the
tank<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:25.200> soon<00:02:25.379> as<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.620> gets<00:02:25.680> back<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.129> pressure

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
tank as soon as it gets back to pressure

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
tank as soon as it gets back to pressure
it<00:02:26.970> shuts<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.360> down<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.930> use<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
it shuts it down so you can use that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.940 
it shuts it down so you can use that
sink<00:02:29.040> source<00:02:29.340> without<00:02:29.879> having<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.450> pressure

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
sink source without having that pressure

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.020 
sink source without having that pressure
constantly<00:02:31.950> being<00:02:32.099> generated<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.790> pump

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
constantly being generated in the pump

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.770 
constantly being generated in the pump
okay<00:02:33.629> shut<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.200> down<00:02:35.599> alright

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
okay shut it down alright

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.699 
okay shut it down alright
so<00:02:36.930> real<00:02:37.769> simple<00:02:38.220> water<00:02:38.849> water<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.450> 40<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.319> in

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
so real simple water water for 40 and in

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.229 
so real simple water water for 40 and in
our<00:02:40.830> next<00:02:40.980> demonstration<00:02:41.250> I'll<00:02:41.819> show<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.030> how

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
our next demonstration I'll show you how

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.150 
our next demonstration I'll show you how
to<00:02:42.330> fill<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.930> cycle<00:02:43.560> which<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
to fill and cycle which is one of the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160 
to fill and cycle which is one of the
biggest<00:02:44.489> problems<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.209> any<00:02:45.510> water<00:02:45.780> supply

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
biggest problems with any water supply

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830 
biggest problems with any water supply
is<00:02:46.829> being<00:02:46.860> able<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.489> rotate<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.090> simply<00:02:48.480> thank

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
is being able to rotate it simply thank

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.260 
is being able to rotate it simply thank
you<00:02:48.959> very<00:02:49.110> much
