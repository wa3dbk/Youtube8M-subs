fine<00:00:18.960> pan<00:00:19.230> will<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.590> try<00:00:20.279> not<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> wok

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
fine pan will do try not to use a wok

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
fine pan will do try not to use a wok
because<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.449> wok<00:00:21.600> has<00:00:21.810> high<00:00:22.050> sides<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
because the wok has high sides and the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.290 
because the wok has high sides and the
rice<00:00:23.220> will<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.609> look<00:00:23.760> properly

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
rice will not look properly

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.210 
rice will not look properly

medium grain rice will that will do now

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.340 
medium grain rice will that will do now
I've<00:01:18.310> got<00:01:18.490> two<00:01:18.670> cups<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.119> rice<00:01:19.270> here<00:01:19.660> and<00:01:19.930> that

will provide me then with four cups of
cooked<00:01:25.390> rice<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.649> I'm<00:01:26.740> just<00:01:26.920> mixing<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.490> up

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610

cooked rice so I'm just mixing it up
here<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.750> idea<00:01:29.080> is<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> leave<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.800> rice

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
here and the idea is to leave the rice

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.330 
here and the idea is to leave the rice
cooking<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.670> tiny<00:01:31.330> bit<00:01:31.720> so<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:33.039> grains

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
cooking a tiny bit so that the grains

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.270 
cooking a tiny bit so that the grains
actually<00:01:33.789> open<00:01:34.539> up<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.780> little<00:01:34.990> bit<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.320> assist

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
actually open up a little bit and assist

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.969 
actually open up a little bit and assist
in<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> cooking<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.210> that's<00:01:37.390> all<00:01:37.600> I've<00:01:37.750> done

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
in the cooking so that's all I've done

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450 
in the cooking so that's all I've done
now<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.039> see<00:01:39.520> me<00:01:39.700> stir<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> rice<00:01:40.300> now<00:01:40.690> but<00:01:41.560> one

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
now you see me stir the rice now but one

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.859 
now you see me stir the rice now but one
of<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.640> important<00:01:43.030> things<00:01:43.210> about<00:01:43.450> cooking<00:01:43.630> a

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
of the important things about cooking a

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.050 
of the important things about cooking a
pea<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.800> once<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.250> rice<00:01:45.430> starts<00:01:45.580> cooking

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
pea is that once the rice starts cooking

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.420 
pea is that once the rice starts cooking
is<00:01:46.660> not<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.050> stir<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:48.070> that<00:01:48.220> might<00:01:48.399> be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
is not to stir it and that might be

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.300 
is not to stir it and that might be
different<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.000> other<00:01:49.149> rice<00:01:49.360> dishes<00:01:50.310> but

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
different to other rice dishes but

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.240 
different to other rice dishes but
that's<00:01:51.520> what<00:01:51.700> we<00:01:51.850> want<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.210> avoid<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.650> now<00:01:54.159> that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that's what we want to avoid so now that

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.490 
that's what we want to avoid so now that
I've<00:01:54.490> sort<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:54.970> stirred<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> rice<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
I've sort of stirred the rice see and

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.780 
I've sort of stirred the rice see and
I'm<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.799> going<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.070> flatten<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.580> out<00:01:57.729> a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
I'm just going to flatten it out a

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.929 
I'm just going to flatten it out a
little<00:01:57.970> bit<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:59.140> get<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> nice<00:01:59.619> even<00:01:59.950> amount

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
little bit so I get a nice even amount

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.920 
little bit so I get a nice even amount
across<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.990> bottom<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.439> dish<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:03.280> first

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
across the bottom of the dish the first

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.630 
across the bottom of the dish the first
thing<00:02:04.930> I'm<00:02:05.080> going<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.650> put<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.100> one<00:02:06.610> cup

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
thing I'm going to do is put in one cup

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.509 
thing I'm going to do is put in one cup
of<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.930> stock<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.380> I've<00:02:08.679> made<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.429> way

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
of a stock that I've made and the way

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
that I've made the stock is simply by

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.910 
that I've made the stock is simply by
boiling<00:02:12.160> some<00:02:12.760> prawn<00:02:13.030> heads<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:14.470> for<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.739> few

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
boiling some prawn heads just for a few

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.430 
boiling some prawn heads just for a few
minutes<00:02:15.220> I'm<00:02:15.370> only<00:02:15.579> putting<00:02:15.880> one<00:02:16.329> cup<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
minutes I'm only putting one cup of the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.130 
minutes I'm only putting one cup of the
stock<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:19.410> now<00:02:21.180> three<00:02:22.180> cups<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.690> just

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
stock in and now three cups of just

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.100 
stock in and now three cups of just
normal<00:02:23.590> water<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.700> I'm<00:02:24.850> doing<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.329> simply

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
normal water and I'm doing that simply

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.990 
normal water and I'm doing that simply
because<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.410> don't<00:02:26.680> want<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.549> prawn<00:02:28.329> flavor<00:02:28.780> to

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
because I don't want the prawn flavor to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620 
because I don't want the prawn flavor to
just<00:02:31.000> dominate<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.920> pea<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.790> now<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.390> see

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
just dominate the pea so now as you see

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.509 
just dominate the pea so now as you see
we<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.049> bit<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.530> floating<00:02:35.890> mess<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
we have a bit of a floating mess and

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.600

that's<00:02:36.610> usually<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:38.410> scary<00:02:38.890> part<00:02:39.220> because

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that's usually the scary part because

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.759 
that's usually the scary part because

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
okay so I'll bangali our clams are

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.490 
okay so I'll bangali our clams are
started<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.090> open<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.900> what<00:05:16.080> I'm<00:05:16.200> noticing

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
started to open and what I'm noticing

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.270 
started to open and what I'm noticing
now<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:18.680> prawns<00:05:19.680> are<00:05:19.800> starting<00:05:20.160> to

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
now is that the prawns are starting to

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.060 
now is that the prawns are starting to
turn<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.850> nice<00:05:21.420> little<00:05:21.750> pink<00:05:21.990> once<00:05:22.710> that

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
turn a nice little pink once that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.650 
turn a nice little pink once that
happens<00:05:23.490> what<00:05:23.700> you<00:05:23.820> have<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.150> do<00:05:24.270> really<00:05:24.540> is

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
happens what you have to do really is

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.890 
happens what you have to do really is
gently<00:05:25.350> turn<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.070> prawn<00:05:26.430> around<00:05:26.870> face<00:05:27.870> the

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
gently turn the prawn around face the

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.200 
gently turn the prawn around face the
other<00:05:28.170> way<00:05:28.350> so<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.740> starts<00:05:29.130> to<00:05:29.370> cook<00:05:29.970> on<00:05:30.180> both

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
other way so it starts to cook on both

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.320 
other way so it starts to cook on both
sides<00:05:30.690> okay<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.140> gently<00:05:31.590> basically<00:05:32.310> just<00:05:33.030> turn

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
sides okay so gently basically just turn

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.100 
sides okay so gently basically just turn
your<00:05:33.510> prawn<00:05:33.720> around<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:36.480> that<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.780> starts<00:05:36.960> to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
your prawn around so that it starts to

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.440 
your prawn around so that it starts to
cook<00:05:37.320> on<00:05:37.530> both<00:05:37.710> sides<00:05:37.980> what<00:05:38.670> we've<00:05:38.820> got<00:05:39.000> now<00:05:39.180> is

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
cook on both sides what we've got now is

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.510 
cook on both sides what we've got now is
the<00:05:39.630> pay<00:05:39.780> is<00:05:39.900> cooking<00:05:40.260> nicely<00:05:40.410> but<00:05:41.340> you'll

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
the pay is cooking nicely but you'll

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.120 
the pay is cooking nicely but you'll
notice<00:05:41.700> that<00:05:41.880> some<00:05:42.300> areas<00:05:43.170> of<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.680> dish<00:05:43.890> have

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
notice that some areas of the dish have

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.290 
notice that some areas of the dish have
liquid<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.640> others<00:05:44.910> don't

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
liquid and others don't

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.150 
liquid and others don't
so<00:05:45.810> rather<00:05:46.170> than<00:05:46.320> stirring<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.890> what<00:05:47.040> I'm

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
so rather than stirring it what I'm

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.860 
so rather than stirring it what I'm
going<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.460> do<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.760> simply<00:05:48.120> with<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.300> spoon<00:05:48.690> as

going to do is simply with a spoon as
I'm<00:05:48.990> going<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.200> make<00:05:49.350> some<00:05:49.560> channels<00:05:50.090> just

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
I'm going to make some channels just

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.660 
I'm going to make some channels just
make<00:05:51.420> some<00:05:51.600> little<00:05:51.720> channels<00:05:52.200> so<00:05:53.160> I<00:05:53.190> can<00:05:53.460> just

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
make some little channels so I can just

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.260 
make some little channels so I can just
let<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:53.910> water<00:05:54.090> run<00:05:54.510> in<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.950> it<00:05:56.700> looks<00:05:56.970> almost

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270
