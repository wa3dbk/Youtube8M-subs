ronaldinho repeatedly kicking the ball
off<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.610> crossbar<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.090> mean<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.330> has<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
off the crossbar I mean this has got to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.570 
off the crossbar I mean this has got to
be<00:02:18.870> fake<00:02:19.260> hasn't<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.770> there's<00:02:19.920> no<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.220> that

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
be fake hasn't it there's no way that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.190 
be fake hasn't it there's no way that
you<00:02:20.670> could<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.680> watch<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:24.200> fantastic

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
you could do this watch this fantastic

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080 
you could do this watch this fantastic
this<00:02:25.320> isn't<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.830> think<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> first<00:02:26.850> time<00:02:26.970> you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
this isn't it I think the first time you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.730 
this isn't it I think the first time you
watch<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> first<00:02:27.810> time<00:02:28.230> he<00:02:28.350> hits<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
watch for the first time he hits you you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.040 
watch for the first time he hits you you
kind<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.950> go<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.450> think<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.570> could<00:02:30.720> be<00:02:30.780> real

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
kind of go I think that could be real

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.600 
kind of go I think that could be real
but<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.890> watch<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.490> over

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
but then you watch it over and over

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.850 
but then you watch it over and over
again<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.090> go<00:02:33.210> actually<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.560> got<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.830> be

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
again you go actually there's got to be

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.520 
again you go actually there's got to be
some<00:02:35.100> bits<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.610> magic<00:02:35.910> happening<00:02:36.240> here<00:02:36.530> let's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
some bits of magic happening here let's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.140 
some bits of magic happening here let's
go<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.950> back<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> Roger<00:02:38.760> Federer

stuff I mean there is a serious point to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.810 
stuff I mean there is a serious point to
this<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.680> talking<00:02:41.160> about<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.700> is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
this we are talking about this this is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.940

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
really interesting is that the same kind

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
really interesting is that the same kind

the ball may not hit exactly where it
does<00:03:24.750> hit<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.739> might<00:03:25.890> paint<00:03:26.160> out<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.370> ball

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
does hit so you might paint out the ball

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.670 
does hit so you might paint out the ball
that's<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.239> replace<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
little wire or a string to pull the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.699 
little wire or a string to pull the

canister off the top of his head that

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.990 
canister off the top of his head that
might<00:03:37.890> need<00:03:38.070> painting<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.430> later<00:03:38.640> as<00:03:38.850> well

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
