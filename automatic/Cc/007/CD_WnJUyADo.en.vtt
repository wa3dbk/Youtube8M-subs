00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:19.400
 if people had a ladder 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.250
 because really the cost of the river 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.930
 Mapocho is very, very willing to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.810
 daily life 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.399
 but they were on the edge something 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 Russian language and that people get 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.520
 a ladder but apparently he did not die 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.690
 this call risked his life 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.110
 definitely went down to the river alhama 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.110
 the cars 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 quite 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.820
 we are with one of the people who 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820
 as well 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.360
 they are human lives but you do not know that 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.130
 animals also breathe and are the same 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.520
 that one so we have to equal 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.520
 as well 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.200
 congratulate him because you show the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.360
 where are they but I want to be 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.670
 he stood out and he's practically floating 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.190
 Jorge is the sector where the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.800
 there was one who scratched a barking 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.630
 this wall this retaining wall what 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.180
 only he wanted with his brick with his 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.640
 genius was that he was rescued by 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.890
 the street dogs that could 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 having attacked him would have reacted by 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.640
 fear is that there we realize that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.980
 they also have life you breathe like 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.170
 us and that the important thing is to help him 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.790
 to them too and see the matter of the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.819
 stray animals see it is something 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.650
 important to the community where 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.120
 we are standing are going to see animals 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.280
 karen how amazing because we 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.440
 we arrived we met the people and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.630
 we started to see how people and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.310
 we recorded immediately they got 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.880
 a stairs with masters of a work 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.380
 under construction and also themselves 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.360
 risking his life look at the water was 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.459
 completely already reaching the shore 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.380
 these dogs all they wanted was 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.090
 leave the people they obviously 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.100
 they share many times under the bridge 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.540
 of Ã¡lava with people who are in 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.160
 street situation I imagine that those 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.450
 people are also in 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.400
 hostels that are enabled in 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.290
 courses extended for 24 hours 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.120
 but there is the image I think it is 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.310
 an image of the day the image that 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.860
 We are showing below is a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.200
 image the day of solidarity of the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.209
 generosity of people who risking 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.970
 their lives because really now already the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.099
 curious river is that these people 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.260
 rescuing these animals and they achieve them 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.769
 take out four puppies that are already 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.689
 were 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.459
 they were playing on fruits like that 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.049
 they embraced the dogs jumped a flood 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.420
 of course there are people who were giving 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.150
 food after we rescued them and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.450
 they are animals and you have to take them 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.209
 as repeated is at work his 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.349
 house that I was doing around here to 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.239
 I am a traveling merchant and I came to 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.310
 buy for water and I came across this 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.430
 situation 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.069
 because we are human beings we can 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.959
 focus on 2 frozen because it 's because 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.810
 want the exact thing of this person that 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.989
 you, sir, together with three others 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.000
 pedestrians none knew nobody ever 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.280
 he had talked with one another and 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.319
 They decided to look help each other 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.139
 to save the life of four 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.470
 animals really I saw the image 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.630
 we achieve 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.800
 Record 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.250
 as one of the images of the day 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:32.350
 boys with this rescue was a 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:36.060
 point of dying so very briefly 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.060
 that the Rioblanco school knows
