as the inlay tile in this steps in

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.320 
as the inlay tile in this steps in
certain<00:03:38.050> action<00:03:38.380> areas<00:03:38.650> inside<00:03:38.980> your<00:03:39.130> pool<00:03:39.340> to

certain action areas inside your pool to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.570 
certain action areas inside your pool to

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
gives it depth it gives it more of a 3d

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.560 
gives it depth it gives it more of a 3d
dimension<00:03:45.640> than<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.910> does<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:46.270> you're<00:03:46.420> just

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570

I<00:04:13.050> think<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.140> biggest<00:04:14.320> mistake<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.800> lot<00:04:14.980> of

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
I think the biggest mistake a lot of

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.349 
I think the biggest mistake a lot of
people<00:04:15.130> make<00:04:15.550> is<00:04:15.730> when<00:04:15.940> they<00:04:16.000> get<00:04:16.120> ready<00:04:16.299> to

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
people make is when they get ready to

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.750 
people make is when they get ready to
put<00:04:16.480> a<00:04:16.510> pool<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:16.980> they<00:04:17.980> don't<00:04:18.160> allow<00:04:18.400> for<00:04:18.430> that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760
