00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hello, my name is via the bouquet 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.620
 things i'm technical advisor 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.240
 national to the French Federation of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.769
 mountain and climbed and I'm going 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 explain how making a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.719
 French machart beforehand to create 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 this french machart I advise you to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.720
 do a capstan actually on the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 safety carabiner what you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 allows you to let go of the rope 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.480
 here she will always be held she is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.010
 captive and beforehand also it takes 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410
 have done before to close this 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 rope a double fishermen so there 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.199
 introduce you to the cord with the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 carabiner security nearest 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.960
 possible rope and there you go 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 turn the rope around the rope 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 here are the most laps 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 possible for that blocks a maximum 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.660
 here and there I go their foam 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.660
 locked on safety snap hooks 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.730
 so the French walker is a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.739
 self-locking with a cord that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.949
 actually allows to hang on a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.949
 rope 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.159
 so this self blockers is fine 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 because it loosens easily so 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 it also hangs very very well but 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 he can loosen even when he is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 blocked with a very important weight 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.850
 just push it up 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.740
 down and defer it and he goes up 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.850
 on the rope so the self-locking one goes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.290
 to tighten up here he is going to pass the rope 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.200
 here and if I want to loosen it actually 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 just put a little bit of lighten 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.360
 the weight on the knot is to push or 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.850
 up or down and the not 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.740
 looses lo and when I want it 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 block it just put a 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.759
 little weight above leave begins 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.890
 in place and it blocks on the rope so 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.930
 this self locking rope cord 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 when I want to remove it in fact it 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.439
 simply as tasks and here I turn 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 that's it and it's captive because it 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.310
 stay all the time attached to us this 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.750
 that your opinion with the capstan for 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.369
 make aminches to rethink it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.930
 must use ropes of a diameter 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.130
 6 mm 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.229
 and now you know how to make a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.790
 match to rethink is an ideal for 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.469
 to self-insure when one goes down in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.799
 reminder and to go back on ropes 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.799
 fixed
