00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
know he was really close there but he

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.979 
know he was really close there but he
hesitated<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.359> I'm<00:03:29.420> playing<00:03:29.660> him<00:03:29.810> good

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
hesitated so I'm playing him good

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.089 
hesitated so I'm playing him good
defense<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.500> know<00:03:30.560> that's<00:03:30.739> what<00:03:30.799> basically

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
defense you know that's what basically

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.770 
defense you know that's what basically
what's<00:03:31.340> going<00:03:31.549> on<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.910> he<00:03:32.150> comes<00:03:32.419> right<00:03:32.540> here

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
what's going on and he comes right here

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.930 
what's going on and he comes right here
he<00:03:33.019> almost<00:03:33.560> saw<00:03:33.709> her<00:03:33.829> returns<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.400> back<00:03:34.639> and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
that was ridiculous I can't believe I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.220

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
first down and here we go this is the

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.310

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
bunch I was telling you guys about it is

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.170 
bunch I was telling you guys about it is
real<00:04:18.530> glitchy<00:04:18.889> routes<00:04:19.310> all<00:04:19.639> over<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.940> place

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
real glitchy routes all over the place

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.939 
real glitchy routes all over the place
especially<00:04:20.840> with<00:04:21.289> a<00:04:21.320> tight<00:04:21.560> end<00:04:21.739> right<00:04:21.919> there

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
especially with a tight end right there

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.469 
especially with a tight end right there
gets<00:04:22.340> wide<00:04:22.520> open<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:22.880> then<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.060> switch<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.389> up

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
gets wide open and then I switch it up

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.580 
gets wide open and then I switch it up
to<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:24.039> QB<00:04:25.039> wrap<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:26.060> those<00:04:26.660> QB<00:04:27.050> rise<00:04:27.229> from<00:04:27.410> the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
to a QB wrap so those QB rise from the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.110 
to a QB wrap so those QB rise from the
