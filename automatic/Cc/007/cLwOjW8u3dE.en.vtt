00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.090

 with her bag and her suitcase 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.179
 I assumed he was crying 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.179
 but he did not turn around 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.589

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.159

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:35.969

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.969
 beautiful story 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.710
 by the river 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 I do not intend to try badly 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 I did not know 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.799

 who went to see paul mccartney 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.820
 foreign the only place here I 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.260
 I also 10 hours without power 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.930
 air neither eat nor trade is not 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.720
 a complicated thing everything is for sir 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.390
 Paul McCartney is more I am able to do 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.850
 something that 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.320
 that if I'm going to sit on a covers this 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.320
 night of 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.140
 good 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.620
 this is affirmed as lennon and 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.540
 mccartney this song 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.030
 but really composed by John Lennon 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.050
 but I'm going to sing to them because I made a 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.050
 I work on this song 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.759
 I mean, and I dared to be a 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.370
 translation trying to keep the 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.960
 same melody 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.729
 because they are the things that I like the most 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 of the beatles 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.219
 and good I was so excited about 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.120
 that day of concert forms flesh that 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.410
 I said I'm going to play now it's a 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.630
 it's a song he wrote in the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.570
 dances in a second era let's say 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.389
 its history its history is divided into 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.800
 two parts before the speck and after 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:46.350
 the speck is not this and that is directly 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.840
 related to the day that 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.010
 they met bob dylan that bob dylan them 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.010
 took in a little gift there 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.600
 as such 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.949
 I owe them a little gift but apart from them 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.259
 took another gift an opinion about his 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:11.260
 music until then the thousands had 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:15.600
 composed nothing more than things like silos and 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:18.640
 i wanna hold your hand or is one of those 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.060
 very simple things and bob dylan 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.090
 he told them I know one with their little letters there 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.360
 for kids I do not know what's wrong 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.449
 the critics and very tough told them that 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.169
 his lyrics were one thing and very very 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.169
 elementary 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.770
 and John Lennon also got pissed off 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:42.740
 I said he told him 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.240
 that his music was very simple, 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.949
 that nothing else on Saturdays chords in 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.639
 change used a chingo of cordes without 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:52.780
 I was arguing all night 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.129
 and they say that from that moment 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.590
 the beat began to make lyrics 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.539
 a little more elaborate and bob dylan 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.110
 he started making more interesting music 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:05.210
 but this was the first one that says lennon 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.849
 that had to do with that talk with that 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.360
 influence will surely go to 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.360
 recognize
