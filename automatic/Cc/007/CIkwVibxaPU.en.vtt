00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.820
 hello everyone I am the omar and welcome to 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.220
 a new video in this I'm going to talk 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.040
 about the first details of the game 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.960
 dan jones and dragons neverwinter maybe 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.200
 you have never heard of this game 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.599
 but surely you will have heard the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.630
 name of danger sandra ghosn before and is 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.330
 which is the tabletop role play more 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.679
 popular in the world so we have to 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.009
 is a meme or rpg action free to play 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.110
 it will be taken out this year and it will be based 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.510
 in the world of dangerous and dragons 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.120
 forgotten realms therefore has a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.730
 Lots of lore a lot of literature 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.240
 from which to extract content from the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.420
 that create missions and also introduces 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.490
 the action item in an e-mail that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.140
 even if it's not a new thing so we 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.150
 uncheck a little bit of what is the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.490
 world of warcraft that has set guidelines 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.100
 for many years and since 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.230
 it came out basically and therefore 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.739
 introduce enough 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.930
 little things not to mention that I 've already 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.700
 commented before that it's free to play by 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.550
 So much will be free from the moment in 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.440
 that comes out will benefit skins 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.729
 among other things decorative objects 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.460
 above all and they also comment that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.110
 will get a very important element 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.200
 and that seems to me quite 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 interesting the groups of players 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.460
 will be 5 and before leaving the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.140
 city from where we will have to 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.560
 choose the skills we will use 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.840
 during the next few hours this makes 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 we can not exchange the skills 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.570
 to our liking but we have to 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.210
 plan how we will play what role and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.090
 with our friends because the least 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.570
 detail if someone from the group is not 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.850
 well compensated we may end up dead and 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.440
 we can not change skills until 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.410
 that they do not kill us or until we have 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.600
 completed the mission that will touch us what 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.340
 which I think adds a lot of seriousness 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.189
 To the subject 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.500
 a quite powerful novelty my opinion 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.319
 because ideas are already missing and many 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.569
 years that this market is stagnating and 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.819
 with each new detail like these from the 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.459
 elements of action of the elements of 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.879
 so the games win a little bit 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.580
 better playability more entertainment not 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.810
 we get bored so much and finally I just 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 It remains to comment that the fighting 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.640
 will base in real time and good once 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.280
 more in another game we will see the cool down 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.860
 implemented we will have to wait for some 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.810
 how many seconds to attack again and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.519
 Well practically it 's all for today already 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.930
 you know you will have more soon thanks for 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.930
 see me and until next time
