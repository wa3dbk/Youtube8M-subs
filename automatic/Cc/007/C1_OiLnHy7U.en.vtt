00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.580 

I<00:03:03.820> was<00:03:04.820> also<00:03:04.970> doing<00:03:05.480> some<00:03:05.690> copper<00:03:05.720> grease<00:03:06.320> on

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
I was also doing some copper grease on

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.240 
I was also doing some copper grease on
two<00:03:06.950> contact<00:03:07.520> points<00:03:07.810> between<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.470> cow<00:03:09.710> and

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
two contact points between the cow and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:54.190 
two contact points between the cow and
pads<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:11.000> here

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.350 

now<00:03:55.200> here<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:55.710> just<00:03:55.890> rotating<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.670> pin<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
now here I'm just rotating the pin so

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.480 
now here I'm just rotating the pin so
that<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.720> flat<00:03:58.080> part<00:03:58.470> lines<00:03:59.040> up<00:03:59.250> with<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
that the flat part lines up with the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:11.540 
that the flat part lines up with the
caliper

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:23.500 

you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.020 

now<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:24.900> an<00:04:25.290> explorer<00:04:25.710> lock<00:04:26.460> toys<00:04:26.730> are

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
now so like an explorer lock toys are

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.840 
now so like an explorer lock toys are
these<00:04:27.240> molds<00:04:28.140> motors<00:04:29.010> preferred<00:04:29.370> copper

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
these molds motors preferred copper

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.240 
these molds motors preferred copper
grease<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.360> soda<00:04:30.750> both<00:04:31.020> come<00:04:31.560> out<00:04:31.710> easier<00:04:32.070> next

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
grease on soda both come out easier next

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.659 
grease on soda both come out easier next
time<00:04:32.430> without<00:04:32.820> snapping

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.589 

don't<00:04:41.270> over<00:04:41.599> tighten<00:04:41.780> these<00:04:42.080> bolts<00:04:43.479> check<00:04:44.479> the

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
level as you can see it's raised up bit

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.700
