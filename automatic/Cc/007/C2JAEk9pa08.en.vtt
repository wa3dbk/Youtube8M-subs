00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.670 
spider-man I think it's gonna be a hell
of<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.790> lot<00:03:20.940> better<00:03:21.120> than<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
of a lot better than this one and the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.319 
of a lot better than this one and the
diamond<00:03:23.069> selects<00:03:23.310> white<00:03:23.489> man<00:03:23.669> it's<00:03:24.120> gonna<00:03:24.239> be

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
diamond selects white man it's gonna be

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.970 
diamond selects white man it's gonna be
a<00:03:24.419> hell<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.660> lot<00:03:24.810> better<00:03:25.349> than<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.709> one<00:03:25.919> so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
a hell of lot better than this one so

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.610 
a hell of lot better than this one so
this<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.370> really<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> low<00:03:27.480> end<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:28.139> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
this is really just the low end of the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.159 
this is really just the low end of the
toys<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.160> UM<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.639> are<00:03:29.760> upcoming<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:31.049> a

so now sighs a person with lizard here
they<00:03:53.700> are<00:03:55.069> it's<00:03:56.069> not<00:03:56.310> good<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.819> mean

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
they are it's not good the I mean

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.150

spider-man<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.930> taller<00:03:58.169> than<00:03:58.319> lizard<00:03:58.769> here

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
spider-man is taller than lizard here

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.699 
spider-man is taller than lizard here
and<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.000> movie<00:04:00.660> lizard<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> lot<00:04:01.500> taller

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
and in the movie lizard is a lot taller

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.979 
and in the movie lizard is a lot taller
than<00:04:01.859> spider-man<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:03.450> doesn't<00:04:03.900> really

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989

work I mean doesn't matter too much no
not<00:04:07.319> really<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:07.950> he<00:04:08.069> doesn't<00:04:08.459> select<00:04:08.579> lizard

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030
