trip<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.189> bits<00:01:26.399> of<00:01:26.490> string

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
trip see if you put two bits of string

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.050 
trip see if you put two bits of string
on<00:01:26.880> either<00:01:27.030> side<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.659> spin<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.469> real<00:01:29.399> fast

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
on either side and spin it real fast

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.289 
on either side and spin it real fast
it'll<00:01:30.899> look<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.469> though<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.729> bird<00:01:32.969> is<00:01:33.329> inside
