having the right suspension is critical

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.559 
having the right suspension is critical
and<00:00:04.440> drifting<00:00:04.950> you've<00:00:05.670> got<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> have<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> car

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
and drifting you've got to have a car

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.070 
and drifting you've got to have a car
that<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:08.220> can<00:00:08.429> put<00:00:08.790> sideways<00:00:09.300> they<00:00:09.900> will

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
that you can put sideways they will

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.379 
that you can put sideways they will
still<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.530> lot<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.769> correct<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.969> we're

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
still have a lot of correct and we're

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.640 
still have a lot of correct and we're
running<00:00:12.630> basically<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> stickiest<00:00:13.410> street

tires<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.280> get<00:00:14.490> trying<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.089> as

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
tires that we can get trying to get as

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.669 
tires that we can get trying to get as
much<00:00:15.630> grip<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.440> them<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.680> possible

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.439 

we're<00:00:25.679> taking<00:00:25.980> cars<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.550> 800<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.419> a

thousand horsepower we're dialing in

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
thousand horsepower we're dialing in
tons<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> grip<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> forcing<00:00:31.079> them<00:00:31.230> into<00:00:31.770> these

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

power<00:00:32.309> slides<00:00:35.570> do<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.629> line<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.840> side<00:00:37.199> by<00:00:37.230> side

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
power slides do you line up side by side

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.210 
power slides do you line up side by side
you<00:00:38.390> blast<00:00:39.390> along<00:00:39.750> straight<00:00:40.050> away<00:00:40.320> throw<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
you blast along straight away throw the

car in sideways next to another car

00:00:44.269 --> 00:01:22.870 
car in sideways next to another car
really<00:00:45.269> intensive

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.490 

it<00:01:23.270> definitely<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.750> like<00:01:23.870> a<00:01:23.930> switch<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.320> good

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
it definitely is like a switch to good

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.850 
it definitely is like a switch to good
luck<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.310> know<00:01:25.520> time<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.120> go<00:01:26.240> time<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.630> go

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
luck and you know time to go time to go

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.540 
luck and you know time to go time to go
no<00:01:27.860> time<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.160> waste

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
no time to waste

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.790 
no time to waste
can't<00:01:28.820> mess<00:01:28.970> around<00:01:29.510> no<00:01:29.870> mistakes<00:01:30.260> just<00:01:30.470> make

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
can't mess around no mistakes just make

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:58.130 
can't mess around no mistakes just make
it<00:01:30.890> happen

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.360 

getting<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.230> suspension<00:01:59.740> settings<00:02:00.190> the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
getting the suspension settings the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.920 
getting the suspension settings the
alignment<00:02:00.850> dialed<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.750> for<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.560> course<00:02:02.830> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
alignment dialed in for the course is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.780 
alignment dialed in for the course is
very<00:02:04.930> important<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.590> making<00:02:06.430> sure<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.670> it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
very important and making sure that it

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.120 
very important and making sure that it
stays<00:02:06.820> there<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:08.200> important<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.010> if

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
stays there is important to you so if

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.500 
stays there is important to you so if
you<00:02:09.220> have<00:02:09.250> control<00:02:09.640> arms<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:09.910> are<00:02:10.000> flexing

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
you have control arms that are flexing

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.330 
you have control arms that are flexing
if<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.290> have<00:02:11.410> these<00:02:11.590> rubber<00:02:11.830> bushings<00:02:12.250> that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
if you have these rubber bushings that

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
if you have these rubber bushings that
are<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.700> know<00:02:12.820> watching<00:02:13.240> out<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.630> up<00:02:13.720> through

are you know watching out and up through

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.360 
are you know watching out and up through
the<00:02:13.900> corners<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> toes<00:02:14.800> changing<00:02:15.280> the
