00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
just saying yes white would have been a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.440 
just saying yes white would have been a
good<00:01:56.280> idea<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> come<00:01:56.939> forward<00:01:57.329> with

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.300 
would doubt that innocence because

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.850 
they stink no windows users would know
about<00:03:16.180> them<00:03:16.480> breaking<00:03:16.660> down<00:03:16.989> yes<00:03:17.320> all<00:03:17.829> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
about them breaking down yes all the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.039 
about them breaking down yes all the
time<00:03:18.030> but<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.090> think<00:03:19.299> max<00:03:19.480> have<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.870> to

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
time but I think max have this to

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.319 
time but I think max have this to
control<00:03:20.500> alt<00:03:20.680> delete<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.579> we<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.820> absent

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
control alt delete so we have absent

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.630 
control alt delete so we have absent
Apple<00:03:22.900> option<00:03:23.260> escape<00:03:23.440> way<00:03:23.860> better<00:03:24.130> yeah

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
Apple option escape way better yeah

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.330 
Apple option escape way better yeah
totally<00:03:25.510> never<00:03:25.720> way<00:03:26.019> more<00:03:26.290> efficient<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> one

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
totally never way more efficient to one

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.580 
totally never way more efficient to one
hand<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:28.420> can't<00:03:28.660> actually<00:03:28.870> do<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.470> do

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
hand you can't actually do that you do

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.160 
hand you can't actually do that you do
well<00:03:30.100> no<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.370> yeah<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.600> don't<00:03:31.630> know<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.989> other

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
well no I yeah I don't know that other

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.259 
well no I yeah I don't know that other
day<00:03:32.410> escape<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.890> hard<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.190> get<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.670> use<00:03:34.030> two

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
day escape is hard to get to I use two

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.569 
day escape is hard to get to I use two
hands<00:03:34.480> i<00:03:34.630> do<00:03:34.690> my<00:03:35.110> ring<00:03:35.680> finger<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.130> my<00:03:36.340> middle

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
hands i do my ring finger and my middle

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.160 
hands i do my ring finger and my middle
finger<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> apple<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.630> i<00:03:37.720> reach<00:03:37.930> across

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
finger on the apple and i reach across

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.750 
finger on the apple and i reach across
and<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.530> escaped<00:03:38.799> with<00:03:38.920> my<00:03:39.040> right<00:03:39.220> hand<00:03:39.250> so

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
and it escaped with my right hand so

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.340 
and it escaped with my right hand so
it's<00:03:39.940> definitely<00:03:40.239> not<00:03:40.360> totally<00:03:40.930> efficient

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
it's definitely not totally efficient

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.319 
it's definitely not totally efficient
well<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.010> can<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.549> do<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.760> with<00:03:42.850> one<00:03:42.970> hand<00:03:43.000> one

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329

what<00:03:45.190> hey<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.640> do<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.000> all<00:03:46.120> on<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.329> left

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
what hey you just do it all on the left

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.199 
what hey you just do it all on the left
hand<00:03:46.810> side<00:03:46.930> Oh<00:03:47.350> get<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.220> well<00:03:48.640> well

had a single button that the guy who did
the<00:03:56.920> IBM<00:03:57.340> keyboard<00:03:57.610> design<00:03:58.170> didn't<00:03:59.170> want<00:03:59.350> to

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
the IBM keyboard design didn't want to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.949 
the IBM keyboard design didn't want to
give<00:03:59.650> us<00:03:59.799> our<00:04:00.010> single<00:04:00.549> button<00:04:00.790> we<00:04:01.600> program<00:04:01.930> a

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
give us our single button we program a

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.509 
give us our single button we program a
little<00:04:02.200> level<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.560> have<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.860> do<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.100> was

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
computers crash so often they needed a

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.650 
computers crash so often they needed a
dedicated<00:04:18.430> button<00:04:18.580> for<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.060> said<00:04:19.239> yeah<00:04:19.419> just

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
dedicated button for that said yeah just

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.120 
dedicated button for that said yeah just
to<00:04:19.780> fix

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
to fix

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.530 
to fix
it<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.370> here<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:20.610> go<00:04:20.730> here's<00:04:20.940> your<00:04:21.060> fix<00:04:21.360> me

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
it like here you go here's your fix me

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.440 
it like here you go here's your fix me
button<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.860> yet<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.310> think<00:04:23.970> engineers

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
button but yet I think engineers

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.030 
button but yet I think engineers
sometimes<00:04:24.870> try<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.110> make<00:04:25.350> things<00:04:25.530> more

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
sometimes try to make things more

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.530 
sometimes try to make things more
difficult<00:04:26.100> than<00:04:26.700> they<00:04:26.820> need<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.030> be<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.510> sure

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
difficult than they need to be for sure

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.350 
difficult than they need to be for sure
they<00:04:28.440> over<00:04:28.800> engine<00:04:29.130> engineer<00:04:29.790> things<00:04:30.090> and

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
they over engine engineer things and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.300 
they over engine engineer things and
I've<00:04:30.690> run<00:04:30.900> into<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.230> like<00:04:31.500> in<00:04:31.620> radio<00:04:31.950> studios

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
I've run into that like in radio studios

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.550 
I've run into that like in radio studios
my<00:04:32.430> whole<00:04:32.610> life<00:04:32.880> where<00:04:33.450> we<00:04:33.660> had<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.230> one

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
my whole life where we had this one

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.810 
my whole life where we had this one
engineer<00:04:35.040> one<00:04:35.190> time<00:04:35.430> his<00:04:36.390> idea<00:04:36.810> was<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.820> fix

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
engineer one time his idea was to fix

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.740 
engineer one time his idea was to fix
our<00:04:40.190> machine<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:42.000> he<00:04:42.060> had<00:04:42.210> this<00:04:42.330> giant

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
our machine and and he had this giant

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.000 
our machine and and he had this giant
but<00:04:43.020> I'm<00:04:43.110> not<00:04:43.230> making<00:04:43.500> this<00:04:43.530> up<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.860> was<00:04:43.980> a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
but I'm not making this up it was a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.670 
but I'm not making this up it was a
giant<00:04:44.520> button<00:04:45.060> like<00:04:45.690> instead<00:04:46.140> normally<00:04:46.500> on<00:04:46.590> a

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
giant button like instead normally on a

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.170 
giant button like instead normally on a
radio<00:04:46.920> board<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.280> have<00:04:47.370> small<00:04:47.610> buttons<00:04:47.970> and

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
radio board you have small buttons and

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.150 
radio board you have small buttons and
