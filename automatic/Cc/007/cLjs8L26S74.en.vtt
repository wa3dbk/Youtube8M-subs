00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
see it's going to be converted to an

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.819 
see it's going to be converted to an
IROC<00:00:56.329> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> dash<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
IROC if you see the dash right there you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
IROC if you see the dash right there you
get<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.190> mo<00:00:59.520> says<00:01:00.059> z28<00:01:02.930> there<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> go

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
get that little mo says z28 there you go

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.480 
get that little mo says z28 there you go
that<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.090> z28<00:01:06.810> badge<00:01:07.490> that

that right there is the z28 badge that
is<00:01:08.869> just<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> small<00:01:10.320> fraction<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.920> what's<00:01:11.760> going

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
is just a small fraction of what's going

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.920
