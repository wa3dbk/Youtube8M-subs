though<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> got<00:01:50.850> me<00:01:50.970> thinking<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.360> whether

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
though it got me thinking about whether

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.780 
though it got me thinking about whether
I<00:01:51.930> would<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:52.890> operation<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
I would want the pretty operation if I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.389 
I would want the pretty operation if I
was<00:01:54.119> an<00:01:54.210> ugly<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.020> world<00:01:55.259> admittedly<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
was an ugly in that world admittedly I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.010 
was an ugly in that world admittedly I
came<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> conclusion<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.750> grown

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
came to the conclusion that if I grown

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.569 
came to the conclusion that if I grown
up<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.469> world<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> i<00:01:59.130> thought<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> way

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
up in that world and i thought the way

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.490 
up in that world and i thought the way
that<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> look<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.450> considered<00:02:00.899> ugly<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that I look now was considered ugly I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.090 
that I look now was considered ugly I
