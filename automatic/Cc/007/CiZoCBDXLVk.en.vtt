00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.860 
alright today I'm going to show you
another<00:00:03.740> application<00:00:04.250> of<00:00:04.670> how<00:00:05.450> to<00:00:05.509> use<00:00:05.689> the

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
another application of how to use the

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.809 
another application of how to use the
nerd<00:00:06.050> but<00:00:06.830> what's<00:00:07.250> different<00:00:07.399> about<00:00:07.580> this

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:07.819 
nerd but what's different about this

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.520 
nerd but what's different about this
application<00:00:08.540> is<00:00:08.660> it's<00:00:08.840> going<00:00:08.990> to<00:00:09.050> be<00:00:09.139> a<00:00:09.170> mobile

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
application is it's going to be a mobile

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.650 
application is it's going to be a mobile
application<00:00:10.240> that's<00:00:11.240> probably<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.570> most

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
application that's probably the most

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.480 
application that's probably the most
powerful<00:00:11.960> thing<00:00:12.260> about<00:00:12.470> this<00:00:12.620> device<00:00:12.950> is<00:00:13.250> the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
powerful thing about this device is the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.980 
powerful thing about this device is the
fact<00:00:13.730> that<00:00:13.850> it<00:00:14.030> doesn't<00:00:14.390> require<00:00:14.510> the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
fact that it doesn't require the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.620 
fact that it doesn't require the
internet<00:00:15.170> in<00:00:15.650> order<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:16.099> work<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.180> I<00:00:17.480> can

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
internet in order to work so I can

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.779 
internet in order to work so I can
control<00:00:18.169> this<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:18.619> can<00:00:18.859> connect<00:00:19.130> this<00:00:19.189> to<00:00:19.310> a<00:00:19.490> car

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
control this I can connect this to a car

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.179 
control this I can connect this to a car
boat<00:00:20.300> RV<00:00:21.730> anything<00:00:22.730> you<00:00:22.849> want<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.179> do<00:00:23.960> today

install<00:00:25.189> this<00:00:27.669> you<00:00:28.669> know<00:00:28.789> my<00:00:28.970> winch<00:00:29.210> comes

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
install this you know my winch comes

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.889 
install this you know my winch comes
with<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.499> wired<00:00:31.509> control<00:00:32.509> but<00:00:32.720> I've<00:00:32.810> only

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
with this wired control but I've only

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.369 
with this wired control but I've only
got<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.200> blip<00:00:33.559> two<00:00:33.800> feet<00:00:34.399> of<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.699> fire<00:00:35.030> here<00:00:35.379> using

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
got a blip two feet of a fire here using

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.479 
got a blip two feet of a fire here using
so<00:00:37.160> what<00:00:37.399> I'm<00:00:37.519> thinking<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.969> if<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.180> had<00:00:38.359> a<00:00:38.390> nerd

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
so what I'm thinking is if I had a nerd

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.319 
so what I'm thinking is if I had a nerd
my<00:00:40.489> iphone<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:41.090> control<00:00:41.449> anywhere<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.019> want<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
my iphone in control anywhere I want to

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.369 
my iphone in control anywhere I want to
what<00:00:44.329> can<00:00:44.480> at<00:00:44.629> it<00:00:45.219> plugged<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:46.309> goes<00:00:46.929> here<00:00:47.929> into

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
what can at it plugged it goes here into

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.919 
what can at it plugged it goes here into
side<00:00:48.859> of<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.070> winds<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.879> I<00:00:50.149> am<00:00:50.329> just<00:00:50.600> going<00:00:50.839> to

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
side of the winds and I am just going to

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.989 
side of the winds and I am just going to
wire<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.530> nerd<00:00:51.710> directly<00:00:52.190> into<00:00:52.429> this<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:52.969> I

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
wire the nerd directly into this so I

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.450 
wire the nerd directly into this so I
can<00:00:53.120> make<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.570> plug-and-play<00:00:53.809> device<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:55.309> I

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
can make it a plug-and-play device and I

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.950 
can make it a plug-and-play device and I
can<00:00:55.640> just<00:00:55.670> keeping<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.179> glove<00:00:56.839> compartment

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
can just keeping the glove compartment

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.369 
can just keeping the glove compartment
until<00:00:57.440> needed<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.730> let's<00:00:59.480> get<00:00:59.659> started<00:00:59.839> and

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
until needed so let's get started and

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.680 
until needed so let's get started and
see<00:01:00.980> how<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.249> works<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:01.789> would<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:02.300> come<00:01:02.539> up

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
see how this works I would I come up

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.750 
see how this works I would I come up
with<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.230> found<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:06.070> just<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.370> one<00:01:07.520> used

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
with as I found a just like the one used

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.540 
with as I found a just like the one used
on<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:08.870> remote<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.160> put<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.520> on<00:01:10.610> my<00:01:10.670> nerd

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
on this remote and I put it on my nerd

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.310 
on this remote and I put it on my nerd
and<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.670> tested<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.330> ball<00:01:14.540> just<00:01:14.750> coming<00:01:15.140> out<00:01:15.260> of

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
and I tested the ball just coming out of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.200 
and I tested the ball just coming out of
this<00:01:15.560> connector<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.220> found<00:01:16.370> I<00:01:16.520> had<00:01:16.700> 12<00:01:16.970> volt

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
this connector and I found I had 12 volt

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.860 
this connector and I found I had 12 volt
drowned<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.460> plus<00:01:19.460> 12<00:01:19.790> lb<00:01:20.150> see<00:01:20.360> right<00:01:20.630> here

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
drowned and plus 12 lb see right here

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.170 
drowned and plus 12 lb see right here
available<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.620> me<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.550> nerd<00:01:22.730> can<00:01:22.910> run

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
available to me and the nerd can run

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.210 
available to me and the nerd can run
directly<00:01:23.510> off<00:01:23.870> 12<00:01:24.140> volt<00:01:24.350> DC<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.100> is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
directly off 12 volt DC so this is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.910 
directly off 12 volt DC so this is
perfect<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:26.510> all<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:26.810> need<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.110> do<00:01:27.350> is

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
perfect so now all I need to do is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.690 
perfect so now all I need to do is
connect<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.820> nerd<00:01:29.050> into<00:01:30.050> here<00:01:30.490> secure<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.520> up

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
connect the nerd into here secure it up

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.630 
connect the nerd into here secure it up
out<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.090> way<00:01:32.290> anytime<00:01:33.290> I<00:01:33.410> want<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.680> use<00:01:33.860> so

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
out of the way anytime I want to use so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:02:08.400 
out of the way anytime I want to use so
let's<00:01:34.820> give<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.180> try
