that i'm really liking it and I was kind

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
that i'm really liking it and I was kind
of<00:01:32.820> hesitant<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.600> tune<00:01:33.960> when<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> product

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of hesitant about a tune when a product

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
of hesitant about a tune when a product
just<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.670> opinion<00:01:36.200> shampoos

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
just because in my opinion shampoos

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.690 
just because in my opinion shampoos
meant<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> cleanse<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.009> scalp<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.579> then

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
meant to cleanse your scalp and then

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
meant to cleanse your scalp and then
conditioners<00:01:39.180> much<00:01:39.360> condition<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> hair<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
conditioners much condition the hair so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
conditioners much condition the hair so
shampoo<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.820> times<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.479> kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> drying

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
shampoo at times can be kind of drying

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410 
shampoo at times can be kind of drying
so<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> felt<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.299> get

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
so I felt like how do you kind of get

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.139 
so I felt like how do you kind of get
that<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.899> product<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:46.860> like
