00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello my dear is coming now 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.980
 small review about my prada bag 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.849
 and that is the Italian name of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.130
 this bag at leto aperto i hope 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.820
 That 's right because Italian 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 Unfortunately, I can not speak 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 yes it is a prada bag you can 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 see here a big logo on it who 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.759
 Here comes a viola bucket comes 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.950
 of course in a cloth bag 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.660
 you also see prada milano and with it you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.940
 Also until this is an original bag 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.640
 is some people thinking yes it would be one 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 use fakes or something 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.960
 that's a small envelope and once 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 in this envelope is once this 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 certificate card in there is still there 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.840
 times the name and the color and the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.130
 material then once a little one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.140
 note card which just so what is so 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 must know and here is again 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.619
 written on it you see prada 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.240
 and then you can join us again 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 recognize leto aperture and so on yes 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 That's your bag is original now 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.369
 But let's get to the techno and that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 she sees at first sight 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.060
 actually relatively small and firm 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 I think it's super sweet because he is so 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 we have small grinds 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.000
 actually a small so relatively 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.610
 small bag at first sight 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 Also nice here with it once it is to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 by the way, jakat fabric and here that is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.200
 leather and when you turn the amal you 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 See the super cool feet easy 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.950
 You are very practical you can pocket 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.100
 just put it down and it stays 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.189
 just stand there then you have 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.490
 still this longer handle 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.910
 Henkel you can do that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.380
 I'll just do it now 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.239
 once and you can see it here too 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.520
 From now on, it is now for me 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.950
 easier yes the bag is actually 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.290
 relatively open except for this magnet 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.110
 button and now we can go here 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.760
 look what the best thing about this 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.830
 bag is you see here one 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.209
 push button that means you can change the size 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.750
 change that does not matter anymore 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.299
 once all the laws on here 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.860
 By the way, again I think so now 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.680
 you recognize that there is also again 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:51.790
 on it prada milano the logo from the inside 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.980
 is also made super nice that in 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.870
 the inside the ingredient of the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.120
 downtown Sorry I have to 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.549
 a lot of English talked yes is also with 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.530
 prada writing 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.870
 and if that's a little closer 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.040
 could recognize here again prada 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.209
 milano with logo and there you can the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.010
 fabric then also see again now 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.340
 great shine and it really is 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.440
 original I, I, too, the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.320
 certificate and everything shown yes I have 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.459
 actually bought the bag 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.100
 that should be such an all- rounder 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.390
 I will also use this bag 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.900
 I also honest to the uni 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.780
 yes that happens before but me 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.250
 Show me something now fits 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.799
 and if you have a magazine now 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.870
 fits in the landscape orientation is the loose 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.670
 no problem 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.319
 very briefly these are my university documents 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.579
 the cash registers are looser too 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.300
 my now not fit much into so 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.880
 I say only a little less than an hour 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.040
 or has 2 or so I take that 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.670
 bag stop with otherwise maybe 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.860
 not like that 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:01.100
 That's why I want to get it out again, yes 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:06.020
 then we have perfume again and then 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.530
 we have de we have our screen in 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.980
 sunglasses in the summer months as well 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:18.080
 my emily and marie then i will take 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:22.100
 then take a 0 5 liter bottle with it 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.160
 I still have my digital camera with me and there 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.030
 the bag 4 was opened so fit 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:33.520
 much more because, for example 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.930
 my little bag for accessories 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.160
 perhaps even if they made what 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.330
 A small dipper wants to measure too 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240
 we just take it very conveniently 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:51.100
 yes, next is yes 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:54.640
 I will come to you super cold 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.470
 this bag is full 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.840
 So you also see for a small one 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.340
 overnight you can enjoy this session 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.640
 of course I use it very much 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.290
 clear but that will work 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.710
 yes, it's just super send hand too 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.780
 do not hold up as some 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.010
 I might have other bags 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.040
 but also super unobtrusive actually 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.550
 and a super nice color in the 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.410
 summer and also in winter can use 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.960
 yes because they do so nature nature 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.620
 kept it that way and I hope so 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.970
 that helped you 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.919
 You also like the bag as much as you like 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.150
