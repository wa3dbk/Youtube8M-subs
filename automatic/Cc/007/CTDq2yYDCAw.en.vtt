this Moab I think I died once in this
game<00:00:17.430> right<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.000> start<00:00:18.060> within<00:00:18.480> like

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
game right from the start within like

game right from the start within like
two<00:00:18.900> points<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.710> domination<00:00:20.130> score<00:00:20.609> then

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
two points of the domination score then

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.939 
two points of the domination score then
just<00:00:21.359> went<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> streak<00:00:22.109> right<00:00:22.410> away<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949

the<00:00:24.840> start<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> game<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:25.830> pretty

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the start of the game so that's pretty

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.390 
the start of the game so that's pretty
cool<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.930> yeah<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.170> basically<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> most

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
cool and yeah so basically for the most

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
cool and yeah so basically for the most
part<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.000> game<00:00:30.300> basically<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.840> did

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
part of this game basically what I did

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.990 
part of this game basically what I did
was<00:00:31.320> control<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.980> whole<00:00:32.279> left<00:00:32.520> side<00:00:32.730> which

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
was control this whole left side which

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.260 
was control this whole left side which
is<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.600> favorite<00:00:33.860> area<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.250> patrol<00:00:35.760> on

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
is really my favorite area to patrol on

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.209 
is really my favorite area to patrol on
this<00:00:36.870> map<00:00:37.079> underground<00:00:37.649> especially<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this map underground especially in

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
this map underground especially in
domination<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.149> team<00:00:39.420> has<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.960> C&amp;B<00:00:40.530> flag

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
domination if your team has the C&amp;B flag

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
domination if your team has the C&amp;B flag
is<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.460> easy<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.940> find<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.809> where<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
is really easy to find out where the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.240 
is really easy to find out where the
spawning<00:00:43.410> usually<00:00:43.860> they'll<00:00:44.040> spawn

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
spawning usually they'll spawn

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.850 
spawning usually they'll spawn
underground<00:00:44.969> downloads<00:00:45.960> long<00:00:46.260> down<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
underground downloads long down that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
underground downloads long down that
long<00:00:47.010> area<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.550> where<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.120> look<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.809> all

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
long area like where I just look but all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
long area like where I just look but all
the<00:00:49.200> way<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.980> those<00:00:50.160> stairs<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the way down there on those stairs you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
the way down there on those stairs you
can<00:00:51.120> usually<00:00:51.270> catch<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.870> few<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.260> spawn<00:00:52.590> there

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
can usually catch a few then spawn there

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
can usually catch a few then spawn there
if<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> wait<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.600> really

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
if you just kind of wait and it's really

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
if you just kind of wait and it's really
good<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.230> marksmen<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:56.280> good

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
good if you have marksmen really good

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.040 
good if you have marksmen really good
strategy<00:00:56.910> though<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> wouldn't<00:00:57.539> recommend<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
strategy though I wouldn't recommend it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
strategy though I wouldn't recommend it
with<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> submachine<00:00:58.949> gun<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.579> relatively

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
with a submachine gun with relatively

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
with a submachine gun with relatively
high<00:01:00.210> recoil<00:01:00.840> such<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.039> UMP<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.789> know

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
high recoil such as the UMP you know

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.460 
high recoil such as the UMP you know
it's<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> greatest<00:01:03.359> long-range<00:01:04.049> weapon

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
it's not the greatest long-range weapon

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's not the greatest long-range weapon
so<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.680> you're<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.100> strategy<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
so if you're gonna use that strategy I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
so if you're gonna use that strategy I
would<00:01:06.000> suggest<00:01:06.240> either<00:01:06.600> an<00:01:06.900> MP<00:01:07.140> 7<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.650> some

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
would suggest either an MP 7 or some

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
would suggest either an MP 7 or some
kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> assault<00:01:08.520> rifle<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.140> also<00:01:10.140> does

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
kind of assault rifle that also does

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.070 
kind of assault rifle that also does
well<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.070> close-range<00:01:11.610> encounters<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
well in close-range encounters so and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.320 
well in close-range encounters so and
then<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> come<00:01:14.850> over<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
then I also like to come over to this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
then I also like to come over to this
area<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> good<00:01:17.100> look<00:01:17.280> over

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
area over here you get a good look over

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.789 
area over here you get a good look over
it<00:01:17.670> directly<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> flag<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.650> could

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it directly at the a flag and you could

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
it directly at the a flag and you could
also<00:01:19.920> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> better<00:01:20.939> view<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
also kind of get a better view with the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.810 
also kind of get a better view with the
people<00:01:21.780> who<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:21.990> coming<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
people who are coming out of that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.190 
people who are coming out of that
underground<00:01:23.820> passage<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.900> could<00:01:25.049> really

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
underground passage and you could really

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630 
underground passage and you could really
take<00:01:25.470> them<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.740> easy<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.549> good

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
take them out easy you have really good

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
take them out easy you have really good
vantage<00:01:26.880> point<00:01:27.270> looking<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.720> over<00:01:27.750> there

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
vantage point looking down over there

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990 
vantage point looking down over there
and<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.130> easy<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> take<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.850> out

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and it's really easy to take them out

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
and it's really easy to take them out
overall<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.689> pretty<00:01:31.409> good<00:01:31.560> strategy<00:01:31.979> for

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
overall and pretty good strategy for

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.469 
overall and pretty good strategy for
getting<00:01:32.280> mo<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:32.939> basically<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.450> i

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
getting mo out of this basically what i

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
getting mo out of this basically what i
would<00:01:33.659> suggest<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.470> make<00:01:34.500> sure<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
would suggest you do just make sure you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
would suggest you do just make sure you
have<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> CMV<00:01:35.549> flags<00:01:35.939> first<00:01:36.240> control<00:01:37.110> those

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
have a CMV flags first control those

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
have a CMV flags first control those
flags<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:37.950> it'll<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.640> whole

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
flags then it'll make it this whole

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.700 
flags then it'll make it this whole
thing<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.299> easier<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
thing a lot easier you see this is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
thing a lot easier you see this is
pretty<00:01:41.310> much<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> route<00:01:41.850> i<00:01:41.880> run<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.600> run

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
around here kind of in a loop through

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
getting my labs and I mean there's a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.330 
getting my labs and I mean there's a
couple<00:02:16.599> reasons<00:02:16.840> why<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.620> much<00:02:17.800> one

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
couple reasons why I like it so much one

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.190 
couple reasons why I like it so much one
I<00:02:18.370> feel<00:02:18.640> like<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> sets<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> goal<00:02:19.930> like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I feel like that it sets you a goal like

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.589 
I feel like that it sets you a goal like
just<00:02:20.560> being<00:02:21.010> relatively<00:02:21.580> high<00:02:21.910> kills<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.390> get

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
just being relatively high kills you get

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.710 
just being relatively high kills you get
24<00:02:23.260> gun<00:02:23.890> kills<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.430> hardline<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.120> feel<00:02:25.540> like

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
24 gun kills with hardline I feel like

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.270 
24 gun kills with hardline I feel like
you<00:02:26.019> know<00:02:26.110> at<00:02:26.230> first<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.650> seemed<00:02:27.040> really

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
you know at first that seemed really

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.400 
you know at first that seemed really
hard<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.819> really<00:02:27.989> challenging<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.260> it's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
hard and really challenging but now it's

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.259 
hard and really challenging but now it's
not<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.590> much<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:30.160> still<00:02:30.370> feel<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.090> is

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
not so much but I still feel like it is

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.020 
not so much but I still feel like it is
a<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.280> goal<00:02:33.489> something<00:02:33.940> to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
a really it's just a goal something to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
a really it's just a goal something to
work<00:02:34.239> towards<00:02:34.630> each<00:02:34.780> game<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.319> that's<00:02:35.410> one<00:02:35.650> of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
work towards each game and that's one of

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.080 
work towards each game and that's one of
the<00:02:35.739> things<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.099> really<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:36.640> it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the things that I really like about it

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
the things that I really like about it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
you know I set goals for myself pretty

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.250 
you know I set goals for myself pretty
much<00:02:39.190> everything<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.760> do<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.660> try<00:02:40.870> my<00:02:40.989> best

much everything I do and I try my best

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.670 
much everything I do and I try my best
to<00:02:41.380> reach<00:02:41.560> them<00:02:41.799> but<00:02:42.510> moles<00:02:43.510> are<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.080> one<00:02:44.650> of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
to reach them but moles are just one of

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.440 
to reach them but moles are just one of
those<00:02:44.799> other<00:02:44.860> things<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.640> feel<00:02:46.060> like<00:02:46.120> they

those other things and I feel like they
kind<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.780> set<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.200> goal<00:02:47.620> for<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.100> by<00:02:48.280> doing<00:02:48.640> that

try to get the double but yeah black ops
2<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.180> around<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.480> corner<00:03:13.540> will<00:03:14.170> living

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
2 is right around the corner will living

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.789 
2 is right around the corner will living
food<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.739> Moab<00:03:15.130> I'm<00:03:15.519> not<00:03:15.820> sure<00:03:16.260> probably<00:03:17.260> not

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
food the Moab I'm not sure probably not

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.650 
food the Moab I'm not sure probably not
is<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.310> guess<00:03:18.609> because<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.150> know<00:03:19.239> treyarch

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
is my guess because you know treyarch

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.390 
is my guess because you know treyarch
doesn't<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> history<00:03:20.859> of<00:03:20.920> including

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
doesn't have a history of including

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400 
doesn't have a history of including
anything<00:03:21.880> like<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.480> their<00:03:23.140> previous

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
anything like this in their previous

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.840 
anything like this in their previous
games<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.870> really<00:03:25.870> wouldn't<00:03:26.260> expect<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:27.430> but

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
games so I really wouldn't expect it but

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.160 
games so I really wouldn't expect it but
you<00:03:28.030> know<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.329> did<00:03:28.450> happen<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.870> would<00:03:29.049> be

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
you know if it did happen that would be

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.780 
you know if it did happen that would be
really<00:03:29.440> cool<00:03:30.030> but<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.329> mean<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.769> don't<00:03:33.190> know<00:03:33.489> I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
really cool but I mean I don't know I

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.940 
really cool but I mean I don't know I
will<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.480> kind<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.900> disappointed<00:03:35.590> if<00:03:35.769> they

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
will be kind of disappointed if they

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.650 
will be kind of disappointed if they
took<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.310> out<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.670> game<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.299> guess<00:03:37.510> that's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
took it out of the game I guess that's

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.270 
took it out of the game I guess that's
kind<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.109> point<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.590> wanted<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.100> get

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
kind of the point that I wanted to get

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.400 
kind of the point that I wanted to get
across<00:03:39.630> I'm<00:03:40.630> not<00:03:40.750> really<00:03:40.930> sure<00:03:41.019> there<00:03:41.319> was

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
across I'm not really sure there was

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.680 
across I'm not really sure there was
really<00:03:41.560> no<00:03:41.769> point<00:03:42.069> in<00:03:42.340> saying<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.090> or<00:03:43.390> in

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
really no point in saying that or in

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.509 
really no point in saying that or in
this<00:03:44.109> topic<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.769> i<00:03:44.799> don't<00:03:45.040> know<00:03:45.100> i<00:03:45.130> just<00:03:45.280> want

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
this topic but i don't know i just want

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.430

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
variation of that come back you know in

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.819 
variation of that come back you know in
modern<00:03:51.639> warfare<00:03:51.819> two<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> other<00:03:52.329> nuke<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.870> in

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
modern warfare two the other nuke and in

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.800 
modern warfare two the other nuke and in
my<00:03:54.340> opinion<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.819> felt<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.420> was<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.569> little

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
my opinion I felt that it was a little

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.140 
my opinion I felt that it was a little
bit<00:03:56.019> too<00:03:56.260> easy<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.829> get<00:03:57.010> maybe<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:58.000> guys

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
bit too easy to get maybe you guys

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.940 
bit too easy to get maybe you guys
disagree<00:03:58.569> but<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.930> definitely<00:03:59.170> feel<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.769> it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
disagree but I definitely feel like it

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.319 
disagree but I definitely feel like it
was<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.069> little<00:04:00.280> bit<00:04:00.459> easier<00:04:00.639> than<00:04:01.060> say<00:04:01.299> the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
was a little bit easier than say the

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.289 
was a little bit easier than say the
Moab<00:04:01.840> just<00:04:02.440> because<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.829> had<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.299> the

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
Moab just because you had the the

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.030 
Moab just because you had the the
killstreaks<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.139> pretty<00:04:05.380> much<00:04:05.560> did<00:04:05.799> all<00:04:05.920> the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
killstreaks that pretty much did all the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.729 
killstreaks that pretty much did all the
work<00:04:06.130> for<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.700> actually<00:04:06.880> led<00:04:07.239> up<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.739> the

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
work for you and actually led up to the

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.940 
work for you and actually led up to the
nuke<00:04:09.069> compared<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.090> mov<00:04:10.750> which<00:04:11.079> only<00:04:11.410> you

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
nuke compared to the mov which only you

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.650 
nuke compared to the mov which only you
know<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.160> could<00:04:12.430> only<00:04:12.579> get<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.209> gun<00:04:13.389> kills

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
know you could only get the gun kills

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.569 
know you could only get the gun kills
for<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.049> that's<00:04:14.139> it<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:15.069> top<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.400> the

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
for and that's it and on top of that the

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.340 
for and that's it and on top of that the
nuke<00:04:15.729> finish<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.419> game<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:16.900> won<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.199> game

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
nuke finish the game and won the game

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.640 
nuke finish the game and won the game
for

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
for

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.370 
for
whereas<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.310> Moab<00:04:18.669> only<00:04:19.479> wipes<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.139> team

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
whereas the Moab only wipes the team

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.020 
whereas the Moab only wipes the team
once<00:04:20.769> which<00:04:21.040> is<00:04:21.190> still<00:04:21.340> good<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:21.759> I<00:04:21.820> feel

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
once which is still good but I feel

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.520 
once which is still good but I feel
likes<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.300> little<00:04:22.389> little<00:04:22.930> bit<00:04:23.110> more<00:04:23.320> balance

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
likes a little little bit more balance

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.460 
likes a little little bit more balance
and<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.370> really<00:04:24.610> do<00:04:24.729> enjoy<00:04:24.759> the<00:04:25.270> Moab<00:04:25.780> more<00:04:26.320> than

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
and I really do enjoy the Moab more than

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.439 
and I really do enjoy the Moab more than
the<00:04:26.560> nuke<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:27.009> really<00:04:27.280> wasn't<00:04:27.910> huge<00:04:28.210> fan<00:04:28.419> and

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
the nuke I really wasn't huge fan and

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.210 
the nuke I really wasn't huge fan and
going<00:04:28.780> for<00:04:28.930> nukes<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.289> don't<00:04:29.470> know<00:04:29.530> i<00:04:29.710> I've

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
going for nukes I don't know i I've

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.820 
going for nukes I don't know i I've
gotten<00:04:30.699> a<00:04:31.000> couple<00:04:31.330> almost<00:04:31.990> as<00:04:32.289> much<00:04:32.380> as<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.620> got

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830
