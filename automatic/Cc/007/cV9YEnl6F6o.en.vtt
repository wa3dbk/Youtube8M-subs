down here i don't know if i can get it

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.850 
down here i don't know if i can get it
in<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.310> light<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:34.849> it<00:04:35.090> is<00:04:35.810> aluminum<00:04:36.380> it's

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
in the light but it is aluminum it's

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.110 
in the light but it is aluminum it's
blue<00:04:37.250> alloy<00:04:38.030> right<00:04:38.330> there<00:04:38.569> hold<00:04:38.780> man<00:04:39.020> in<00:04:39.139> 10<00:04:39.380> on

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
blue alloy right there hold man in 10 on

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.330 
blue alloy right there hold man in 10 on
yeah<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:42.020> steers<00:04:42.289> really<00:04:42.710> good<00:04:42.919> with<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.130> dual

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
yeah it steers really good with the dual

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.010 
yeah it steers really good with the dual
servos<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.060> mean<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.360> thing<00:04:44.599> weighs<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> ton

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
servos I mean this thing weighs a ton

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.980 
servos I mean this thing weighs a ton
but<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.729> picks<00:04:46.729> up<00:04:46.910> with<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.210> dual<00:04:47.419> motors<00:04:47.840> and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
but it picks up with the dual motors and

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.309 
but it picks up with the dual motors and
everything<00:04:48.289> just<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:49.009> get<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.930> good<00:04:50.930> view<00:04:51.169> of
