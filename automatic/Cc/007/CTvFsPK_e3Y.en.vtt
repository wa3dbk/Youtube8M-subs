00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
long time ago when I had a UH when I had

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.850 
long time ago when I had a UH when I had
my<00:02:44.380> trailblazer<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.820> used<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:50.739> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
my trailblazer and I used it and it's a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.250 
my trailblazer and I used it and it's a
lot<00:02:51.010> better<00:02:51.310> than<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:52.330> stuff<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.690> use<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.080> this

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
lot better than the stuff I use on this

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.449 
lot better than the stuff I use on this
truck<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:54.459> when<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.450> comes<00:02:55.660> down<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.459> it's

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
truck but when it comes down to it it's

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.140 
truck but when it comes down to it it's
still<00:02:57.790> cheap<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.959> know<00:02:59.430> like<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.549> say<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.790> foil

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
still cheap you know like I say the foil

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.759 
still cheap you know like I say the foil
is<00:03:01.360> different<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.870> he<00:03:02.019> Civ<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.320> different

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
is different in the he Civ is different

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.420 
is different in the he Civ is different
so<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.910> makes<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.989> big<00:03:05.110> difference<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.970> uh

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
so that makes a big difference but uh

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.660 
so that makes a big difference but uh
like<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.580> say<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:10.390> Dynamat<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.110> definitely

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
like I say this Dynamat is definitely

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.160 
like I say this Dynamat is definitely
what<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.700> will<00:03:12.910> continue<00:03:13.000> using<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.930> probably

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
what I will continue using and probably

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.080 
what I will continue using and probably
when<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.320> get<00:03:14.470> down<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.860> lower<00:03:15.310> 48<00:03:15.400> from

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
when I get down to the lower 48 from

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.640 
when I get down to the lower 48 from
leaving<00:03:16.330> last<00:03:16.630> I'm<00:03:16.870> gonna<00:03:16.989> get<00:03:17.110> some<00:03:17.230> second

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
leaving last I'm gonna get some second

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.310 
leaving last I'm gonna get some second
skin<00:03:17.880> because<00:03:18.880> uh<00:03:18.910> like<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.660> say<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.870> shipping

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
skin because uh like I say the shipping

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.130 
skin because uh like I say the shipping
is<00:03:20.680> really<00:03:21.459> expensive<00:03:21.760> especially<00:03:22.690> was

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
is really expensive especially was

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.640 
is really expensive especially was
shipping<00:03:23.830> second<00:03:24.519> skin<00:03:24.700> up<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.650> shipping

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
shipping second skin up to the shipping

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.009 
shipping second skin up to the shipping
the<00:03:26.680> second<00:03:27.040> skin<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.340> Alaska<00:03:27.910> like<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.840> said<00:03:28.989> I

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
the second skin to Alaska like I said I

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.110 
the second skin to Alaska like I said I
think<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.769> was<00:03:29.860> like<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.220> hundred<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.730> sixty

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
think it was like a hundred and sixty

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.050 
think it was like a hundred and sixty
eight<00:03:31.150> dollars<00:03:31.690> for<00:03:31.980> forty<00:03:32.980> square<00:03:33.040> feet<00:03:33.280> I'm

and<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.020> definitely<00:04:34.230> recommended<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:35.340> use<00:04:35.520> a

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
and it's definitely recommended to use a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.400 
and it's definitely recommended to use a
heat<00:04:35.790> gun<00:04:35.850> that's<00:04:36.450> one<00:04:36.690> thing<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.960> can't<00:04:37.230> vote

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
heat gun that's one thing I can't vote

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.920 
heat gun that's one thing I can't vote
for<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.880> know<00:04:39.000> like<00:04:39.330> this<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.510> use<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.780> heat

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
for you know like this I use the heat

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.410 
for you know like this I use the heat
gun<00:04:39.960> before<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.640> what<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.760> last<00:04:41.940> product<00:04:42.240> I

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.350 
gun before and what the last product I
use<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.230> this<00:04:44.040> stuff<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.730> they<00:04:45.030> seem<00:04:45.330> like

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
use and this stuff and they seem like

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.170 
use and this stuff and they seem like
you're<00:04:45.720> stuck<00:04:45.960> but<00:04:46.320> after<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> year<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
you're stuck but after a year the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.540 
you're stuck but after a year the
nest<00:04:48.390> fell<00:04:48.570> off<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:49.230> know<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.620> don't<00:04:50.340> know<00:04:50.430> if

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
nest fell off you know I don't know if

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.090 
nest fell off you know I don't know if
this<00:04:50.700> from<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.780> black<00:04:52.080> material<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.920> he

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
this from the black material that he

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.620 
this from the black material that he
said<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.430> they<00:04:53.580> use<00:04:53.850> oh<00:04:54.180> it's<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.420> big

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
said that they use oh it's a big

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.720 
said that they use oh it's a big
difference<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:55.230> when<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:55.920> compared<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.550> two

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
difference but when I compared the two

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.580 
difference but when I compared the two
adhesives<00:04:57.330> together<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:57.990> looked<00:04:58.260> at<00:04:58.470> them

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
adhesives together and I looked at them

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.630 
adhesives together and I looked at them
mimics<00:04:59.580> the<00:05:00.240> he<00:05:00.450> Civ<00:05:00.630> look<00:05:00.810> different<00:05:01.640> totally

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
mimics the he Civ look different totally

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.270 
mimics the he Civ look different totally
