00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hey, guys, beauty, I'll be right back with one more. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 video of this time with another gameplay 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.670
 of 1.050 good people to see that they do not 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.710
 It's to show a game, it's not for 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.560
 to survive is not to do anything just 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.080
 to talk about the game 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 good guys I 've tried the two months that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.320
 I'm doing the gameplay of this game here. 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.609
 on the channel is not sure who accompanies know 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.590
 that I show the development of the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.270
 game that started there in pre alpha that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 was released on frei alpha is is pre alpha né 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.590
 then passed the alpha and now it's alpha 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.629
 even more so it has been more advanced and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.969
 after you've stopped playing the game 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.840
 dude and that's what I wanted to talk about 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.030
 video is just to talk a little about the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.870
 development of the game is that for the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 face 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.899
 the last update of this game was 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.660
 two weeks ago that the upgrade was 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.460
 Shit put the fla authorization to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.559
 put three new weapons right 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.650
 4 a new one I do not know was a good thing 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.299
 even after that they did not do 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 nothing else does not update the game map 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.080
 change a chart do not give the embi do not give 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760
 anything 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860
 the game remains the same as when 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 Threw the same thing there is nothing 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.770
 different the map is the same 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.119
 the infected are even then so 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.740
 I mean I 'm not criticizing the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 game also have a good game do not want 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.850
 Do not do any of that, I'm just giving my 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 opinion as a buyer is to spend 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 forty five reais in a game and 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.689
 I expected a little more respect or 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.200
 the developers because the guys there 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.150
 it is a game to launch already right 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.780
 I have a message all over there saying that it is 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.479
 pre alpha then alpha nte tento of vision 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.090
 right there but what do we expect 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.649
 the game develops over time, no, not 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.390
 is what is happening as a writing of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.979
 unfortunately this game here I think 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.659
 There will be no future, right? 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.520
 by the floor of the carriage that I am 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.020
 seeing since when I bought it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 I see this game here not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.149
 There's going to be a lot of future tomorrow next year. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.060
 now in January 2015 and will launch the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.830
 hc 1 and with the launch the gaza I think 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.020
 that this game here will enter the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.330
 forgetfulness 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.610
 He did not even catch very well yet 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.690
 fall into oblivion 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.630
 unfortunately the game had everything to give 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.450
 Right is a pretty face game could render 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.060
 this developed dolce the developers 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.160
 do not play German games 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.960
 unfortunately we are seeing that the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.300
 developers are not even there pro game 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.160
 oscar already made their money there 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 Now you do not want to know anything with 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.780
 Nothing, you do not want to play the game anymore. 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.910
 This is a sad face and a game could have 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.130
 future and could be a play 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.360
 we are seeing that it will end in nothing 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.420
 it will end up in pizza 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.450
 well this is my humble opinion pié 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.910
 here of buyer regarding the game I 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.010
 pull the bag game all spoke well in 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.400
 game but after a while guy started 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.410
 yesterday but should play the game every time 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.060
 I did the same thing video of the game. 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.340
 that a time without making runs 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.960
 runs between these little houses to see if you have 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.780
 somebody inside never has almost 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.780
 nothing is not always everything empty 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.460
 I rarely find any item took 34 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.050
 video for me to find these items all 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.450
 that I'm here right? 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.730
 and that's it, man, the game is this, this delay 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.110
 this sameness has no bug if it kills and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.880
 do you think an animal we kill 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.850
 because it is impossible to kill the bug 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.280
 are rarely found to have 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.450
 servers are all empty no one else 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.570
 want to play the game has an idea and this 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.880
 It 's a game that we thought it would 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.209
 have everything good is ending and 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.130
 unfortunately is not broke 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.780
 unfortunately time hole game because the 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.880
 developers not so nervous 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.340
 or else you do not know what we do 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.310
 They are even taking right not take 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.560
 vacation because it sucks guys at a time 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.940
 make a game is not serious almost 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.500
 nobody has a game or when it goes 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.700
 indicate the game someone the person asks 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.620
 the game is good 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.720
 There the person speaking speaks some good thing 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.709
 in the game is that you will speak to present a 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.040
 I do not play 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 The game is rushing you run it play 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.850
 nice guy what else you do you run 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.160
 only he is a sucker 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.549
 just what makes the game running 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.290
 to and fro and not one and that's not what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.710
 make a game that has no purpose yet 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.520
 finished what to do has no vehicle 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.009
 no bug if kill has no player 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.509
 do not have nothing on the team is the game is 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.430
 stopped 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.009
 The game is looking like a desert. 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.379
 In this game he took etna pieces 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.590
 doomsday scenario that has no right 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:42.069
 Because I wanted no ram, there are people in the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.460
 You guys have a notion there is good but I 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.949
 I hope that in the future, this is a bad disk. 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.430
 game is start to really mess it up, huh? 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.080
 and is to send update daily 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.240
 formerly when the game was in pre- 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.039
 Alpha was doing quite a lot 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.259
 finalization he was launching the 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.729
 direct update right? 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.000
 I was all week and launching a 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.360
 update after it released the alpha 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.740
 they stopped right 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.860
 right now having an update 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.430
 no updates from month to month and look 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.759
 over there 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.520
 If you are lucky in this update then the 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.409
 game also has the face is this video that 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.719
 it was not to stick the dick in the game nothing until 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.490
 I do not want to talk about the game I like game 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.190
 Pull this game bag It 's only you to have one 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.800
 idea I say recommend the game for everything 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.659
 The world to play cool has a future right. 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.699
 but I'm just saying this video here that 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.949
 developers abandon the game only 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.729
 I'm talking real game show I do not want 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.530
 To lie, that's all I want is one boss. 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.840
 true but this is what is happening 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.800
 with the game was stopped abandoned has 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.960
 what to do 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.789
 You see, I make video every time. 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.800
 game is every time is the same thing running 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.770
 here and there who's the idiot between 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:55.240
 these houses have nothing inside is fuck 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.550
 face is a blowout for a player but it is 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.310
 That's it, let's see if there's any way out. 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.860
 update the game to change after that 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.569
 video I'll bring a video of course 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.849
 I'm not going to make a video just talking badly about it . 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.830
 game when you have update you have 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.740
 something good in the game for sure 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.229
 I'll go back with the right videos but 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.099
 while you are like this, it will continue 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.289
 this video in the air there and it hurts anyone who hurts 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.210
 but that's it guys this video that was 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.669
 To talk a little about the game, show the 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.620
 unfortunately the game there 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.330
 Map has not got anything yet 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.779
 tab do you see who is on 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.839
 server is pressed on the map has no map 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:37.510
 there is nothing every game also simple 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:39.700
 too much too standard face 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.340
 It's very simple and you do not think of anything. 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.590
 simple this is it is very simple and 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.550
 oscar a mexico in the game that gives more 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.530
 Anger of me 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.710
 if every day they post motorization 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.990
 even if it is a glass of water 11 a 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.720
 standard food 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.250
 a new outfit no matter how things were 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.490
 small and not 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.260
 He's not, does not he? It's a fuck. 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.200
 thing very well you get into the game is the 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.800
 of delay is one if the server loads 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.690
 then syncing synchronizes our 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.910
 I can not play for three hours. 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.380
 after much calm and patience 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.940
