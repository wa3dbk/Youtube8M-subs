messing with this timer over and over

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.850 
messing with this timer over and over
and<00:01:25.909> over<00:01:26.000> again<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.959> timer<00:01:27.200> does<00:01:27.530> is

when when it times out it shuts the

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.279 
when when it times out it shuts the
flame<00:01:31.789> off<00:01:31.969> because<00:01:32.179> it's<00:01:32.390> built<00:01:32.659> in<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.140> got

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
flame off because it's built in it's got

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.529

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
to storm a couple let's build into it as

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.139 
to storm a couple let's build into it as
you<00:01:35.600> can<00:01:35.750> see<00:01:36.020> right<00:01:36.610> thermocouple<00:01:37.610> keeps<00:01:37.970> the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
you can see right thermocouple keeps the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.760 
you can see right thermocouple keeps the
fire<00:01:38.360> going<00:01:38.630> once<00:01:38.899> it's<00:01:39.079> heated<00:01:39.229> up<00:01:40.539> but

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
fire going once it's heated up but

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.050 
fire going once it's heated up but
thermocouple<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:43.069> wired<00:01:43.310> into<00:01:43.610> this<00:01:43.759> timer

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
thermocouple is wired into this timer

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.850 
thermocouple is wired into this timer
this<00:01:44.840> timer<00:01:44.899> hits<00:01:45.530> 20<00:01:46.189> minutes<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:48.560> dingy

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
this timer hits 20 minutes the dingy

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:59.050 
this timer hits 20 minutes the dingy
thing<00:01:55.569> but<00:01:56.569> anyway<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:57.979> investigated<00:01:58.880> it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
thing but anyway so I investigated it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.229

and decided I want to disconnect this

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:09.969 
and decided I want to disconnect this
timer<00:02:03.280> some<00:02:04.280> way<00:02:04.459> somehow<00:02:06.879> so<00:02:08.769> that's<00:02:09.769> what

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
timer some way somehow so that's what

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.620 
your timer and pull the timer out this
was<00:03:11.000> wired<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.730> yellow<00:03:14.120> wire<00:03:14.390> was

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
was wired to here the yellow wire was

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.960 
was wired to here the yellow wire was
wired<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.170> outside<00:03:15.620> you'll<00:03:15.950> see<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.190> party

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.250 

have<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.120> remove<00:03:20.360> these<00:03:20.510> two<00:03:20.570> wires<00:03:20.750> from<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
have to remove these two wires from the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.660 
have to remove these two wires from the
terminals<00:03:22.600> strip<00:03:23.600> them<00:03:23.780> back<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:25.459> take<00:03:25.640> a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
terminals strip them back and take a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.080 
terminals strip them back and take a
buck<00:03:26.000> splice<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:27.260> since<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.580> couldn't<00:03:28.820> loop

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
buck splice and since you couldn't loop

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.130 
buck splice and since you couldn't loop
them<00:03:29.330> around<00:03:30.160> what<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.280> did<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:32.840> took

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
them around what I did is I just took

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.070 
them around what I did is I just took
the<00:03:33.350> butt<00:03:33.560> splice<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:34.400> one<00:03:34.640> end<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.510> both<00:03:35.810> wires

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
the butt splice to one end of both wires

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.810 
the butt splice to one end of both wires
in<00:03:36.350> one<00:03:36.560> end<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.010> Buck<00:03:37.220> splicing<00:03:37.700> together

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
in one end and Buck splicing together

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.750 
in one end and Buck splicing together
just<00:03:38.239> like<00:03:38.330> that<00:03:38.950> plain<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.160> simple<00:03:40.550> it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
just like that plain and simple it's

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.990 
just like that plain and simple it's
real<00:03:41.180> easy<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.630> do

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.360 

once<00:03:45.000> you're<00:03:45.150> done<00:03:45.300> with<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:46.160> put<00:03:47.160> all<00:03:47.250> your

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
once you're done with that put all your

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.710 
once you're done with that put all your
stuff<00:03:47.430> back<00:03:47.879> together<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:49.129> think<00:03:50.129> goes<00:03:50.720> keeps

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
stuff back together I think goes keeps

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.350 
stuff back together I think goes keeps
your<00:03:51.840> timer<00:03:52.050> in<00:03:52.260> there<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:53.360> you

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
your timer in there if you like you

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.559 
your timer in there if you like you
never<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.110> need<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.400> reminded<00:03:57.209> to

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
never know I need to be reminded to

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.720 
never know I need to be reminded to
check<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.170> every<00:03:58.260> 20<00:03:58.709> minutes<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.280> whatever

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
check on it every 20 minutes or whatever

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.930 
check on it every 20 minutes or whatever
you<00:04:00.060> can<00:04:00.209> keep<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.569> timer<00:04:00.840> for<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.910> uh

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
you can keep the timer for that but uh

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.360 
you can keep the timer for that but uh
all<00:04:03.330> in<00:04:03.599> all<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.019> simple<00:04:04.379> deal<00:04:04.560> put<00:04:05.190> your

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
all in all it's a simple deal put your

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.839 
all in all it's a simple deal put your
stuff<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.819> Taylor<00:04:06.060> like<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.510> goes<00:04:06.720> and

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
stuff that Taylor like it goes and

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.490 
stuff that Taylor like it goes and
continue<00:04:08.849> on<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.209> course<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.720> still<00:04:10.019> need<00:04:10.379> to

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
continue on of course you still need to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.670 
continue on of course you still need to
get<00:04:10.680> your<00:04:10.890> starter<00:04:11.670> button<00:04:12.200> hold<00:04:13.200> your<00:04:13.410> button

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
get your starter button hold your button

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.069 
get your starter button hold your button
down<00:04:13.830> until<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.430> hot<00:04:15.209> enough<00:04:15.540> for<00:04:15.780> the

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
down until it's hot enough for the

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.949 
down until it's hot enough for the
thermocouple<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.769> work<00:04:17.479> let<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.570> go<00:04:18.750> and

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
thermocouple to work let it go and

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.060 
thermocouple to work let it go and
you're<00:04:19.109> good<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.350> go<00:04:20.299> whoo<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:22.070> useful

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
you're good to go whoo this is a useful

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
you're good to go whoo this is a useful
video<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:25.380> not<00:04:26.900> plain<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.020> manufacture<00:04:28.650> okay

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
video if not plain to manufacture okay

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.360 
video if not plain to manufacture okay
have<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.120> good<00:04:30.300> day
