I'm<00:00:05.069> dr.<00:00:05.490> Ren<00:00:05.670> Hartung<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.299> what<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.440> here

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
I'm dr. Ren Hartung and what I have here

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.890 
I'm dr. Ren Hartung and what I have here
is<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> human<00:00:08.370> femur<00:00:10.820> this<00:00:11.820> happens<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
is a human femur this happens to be a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.900 
is a human femur this happens to be a
right<00:00:13.200> femur<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.950> way<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.549> that

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
right femur and the way that I know that

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.529 
right femur and the way that I know that
is<00:00:15.059> because<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.570> head<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> femur

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
is because the head of the femur

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.330 
is because the head of the femur
articulates<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> hip<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> points

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
articulates with the hip and points

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.689 
articulates with the hip and points
medially<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.470> this<00:00:22.470> bottom<00:00:22.949> part<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
medially and this bottom part of the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
medially and this bottom part of the
femur<00:00:24.529> these<00:00:25.529> points<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> rear<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.769> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
femur these points to the rear so when I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.230 
femur these points to the rear so when I
put<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.250> against<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.730> body

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
put this up against my body

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
put this up against my body
this<00:00:31.050> points<00:00:31.410> medially<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.640> goes

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
this points medially so I know it goes

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.810 
this points medially so I know it goes
with<00:00:33.030> belongs<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.570> hip<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.550> then<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.610> look

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
with belongs in my hip and then I look

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
with belongs in my hip and then I look
down<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> points

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
down here and see if this points

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.720 
down here and see if this points
backwards<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> should<00:00:37.890> point<00:00:38.129> backwards<00:00:38.370> if

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
backwards it should point backwards if

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490 
backwards it should point backwards if
it<00:00:39.120> doesn't<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.840> put<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> wrong

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it doesn't then I put it on the wrong

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
it doesn't then I put it on the wrong
side<00:00:40.940> for<00:00:41.940> example<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> put<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> lift

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
side for example if I put it on the lift

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.250 
side for example if I put it on the lift
on<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.980> left<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> put<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> right

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
on the left so put it on the right

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.709 
on the left so put it on the right
points<00:00:46.680> backwards<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:48.059> head<00:00:48.270> points<00:00:48.629> in

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
points backwards and the head points in

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
points backwards and the head points in
the<00:00:48.780> right<00:00:48.899> direction<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> tells<00:00:50.879> me

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the right direction so that tells me

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170 
the right direction so that tells me
that<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:52.320> femur<00:00:53.059> for<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that I have the right femur for the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.500 
that I have the right femur for the
features<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.230> femur<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.969> head<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.180> already

mentioned this is the head the neck of
the<00:01:00.809> femur<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> neck

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.389 

the<00:01:06.210> greater<00:01:06.509> trochanter<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.890> nice

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
the greater trochanter is this nice

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.800 
the greater trochanter is this nice
large<00:01:08.820> knobby<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:11.810> it's

large knobby thing off to the side it's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.450 
large knobby thing off to the side it's
for<00:01:13.229> muscle<00:01:13.590> attachment

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.649 

the<00:01:16.970> lesser<00:01:17.390> trochanter<00:01:17.660> is<00:01:18.140> down<00:01:18.470> here

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.010 

the<00:01:25.170> medial<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> lateral<00:01:26.250> condyles<00:01:26.600> are<00:01:27.600> here

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the medial and lateral condyles are here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.069 
the medial and lateral condyles are here
this<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> medial<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
this one is medial and this one is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.450 
this one is medial and this one is
lateral<00:01:31.350> condyle<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> one's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
lateral condyle and you know this one's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.639 
lateral condyle and you know this one's
the<00:01:35.579> medial<00:01:35.909> condyle<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.689> again<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
the medial condyle because again the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.340 
the medial condyle because again the
head<00:01:37.920> points<00:01:38.429> medially<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> condyle

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
head points medially so the condyle

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.850 
head points medially so the condyle
that's<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.770> same<00:01:41.009> side<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> head<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that's on the same side as the head is

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.660 
that's on the same side as the head is
the<00:01:43.860> medial<00:01:44.220> condyle<00:01:48.950> intercondylar<00:01:49.950> fossa

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the medial condyle intercondylar fossa

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.469 
the medial condyle intercondylar fossa
is<00:01:51.210> between<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> condyles

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
is between the condyles

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.999 
is between the condyles
so<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> intercondylar<00:01:55.619> fossa

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
so that would be the intercondylar fossa

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.589 
so that would be the intercondylar fossa
and<00:01:59.009> those<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> features<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
and those are all the features of the

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.960 
and those are all the features of the
femur<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.380> need<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.709> know<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.789> least
