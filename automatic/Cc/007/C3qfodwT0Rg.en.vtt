00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.610
 World Cuckoo today we 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.230
 find for a new video so that 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.560
 is going to be on how to remove the eggs from 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.420
 flies 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.860
 so the waters of flies why 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.950
 do we have to remove them all 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.590
 just because who says f10 larvae 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.390
 various and so that's so I hope that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.740
 you understand my camp is doing so the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.449
 horses have glasses every 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.309
 seasons that I imagine you know it 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.350
 in the worst case I think I will 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.580
 will do a video on it but so the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.260
 fly areas actually when they go to 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.699
 scratch to areas where they have areas 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.070
 red, ie very often on the 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.409
 limbs on the chest and on the chest 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.089
 is well done they go to gurgy tc them this 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.280
 who's going to make sure they're going to have greens 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.379
 so it's not very good for them so 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.570
 so that's why you 'll need 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.460
 just a disposable razor a little bit 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.199
 water for washing or two Vaudois 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.659
 anyone implies as you want 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.070
 So here and so there is my guinea pig 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.019
 cassiopÃ©e so it's a little planet 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.070
 I have not presented you yet 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.990
 that I will not delay to you 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.340
 present it's promised the moon of 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.900
 next videos it will be on his so 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.040
 here in two or three seconds you 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.080
 are going to have an entire you will see she 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.150
 is beautiful and so here and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.090
 now we will start the tutorial 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.410
 right now then the odm or thing to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.610
 see that they are embossed and they are 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.770
 yellow so as we can see on the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.270
 video we will start by coming bros and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.440
 so the areas where we will see the others 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.510
 fly so that's the best it is him 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.730
 to do after a passage and we will pass 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.230
 a razor in the direction of the hairs so if 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.070
 it's on the members and of course the 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.670
 top down 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.740
 one so here and so as you can 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.180
 see the flies as they are in 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.800
 relief as we have a deal gets stuck very 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 easily in the razor blades and 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.040
 it's not the hair that gets stuck 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.540
 here 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.420
 cleans of course between each 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.430
 passage do not hesitate also between each 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.260
 passage passed a little brush stroke 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 on the sell it will remove the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.100
 waters that are not totally 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.530
 part but have already begun to 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 starting to note also is that the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 horses move of course these are 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.560
 living beings so it moves so because 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.250
 the razor that can still make them 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
 wrong 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.240
 do not hesitate to really do everything 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.729
 gently by little strokes all that and at 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.860
 be careful if the hair April if the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.360
 forgiveness horse lifts the paw apa that gets 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.700
 stuck what in the razor blade and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.770
