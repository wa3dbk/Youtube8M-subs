 I want and I think we talked about how to put the muscle while sleeping 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 It is a form that grew up Nagao of the footness consultant 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:28.820
 Factors that impede muscle sound development 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.100
 I guess this is also among them still ne biggest factor is lack of sleep but there are some 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.430
 Nemaa that 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.230
 White for those behind housewife who salaried worker 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:42.920
 For students, work and household chores 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.240
 Everyone has been chronically sleep deprived by study etc. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 there 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:56.180
 Secure sleeping time by asking for a little ingenuity 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.450
 I want to make it possible to build muscle 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.200
 So here I have one eye 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.770
 I would like to raise a little It is an example of to wearing a muscle 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.140
 In terms of those who put 10 kg of muscles while sleeping 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.010
 If the wind that this person or a Mr. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.400
 I will call but this one 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:22.440
 Do not your throat training in the gym of the local sound advertisers 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:29.190
 It seems that you are a muscle training enthusiast, so this is your personal experience 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:35.310
 About 10 kgs of muscles My muscles are gaining Weight gained The muscles that got too stiff 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:38.920
 It was said that she was never fat-thickening, and after all, if it gets muscle in a short time 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.570
 It will be rumored in the gym by all means 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.930
 I wonder if I used that steroid, I really do not do such a thing 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.720
 But I have not used that drug at all but 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:57.130
 That this a's the real was such success was incorporating the training method that is 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.270
 What is that secret ? 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.740
 By saying 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.579
 This is a nap 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 There may be people who seem to be like it, though 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:17.000
 I think that this that does not quite do it even though you know it everyone 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.650
 My son , a, was actually so, but from a certain time 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.850
 I changed the policy 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:30.330
 Because I had been taking time for commuting, I had little sleep 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.800
 We've rented an apartment in the vicinity of the I ventured company in order to break it down 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:40.060
 And lunch break 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.760
 I went back to the apartment home and had a light lunch and then decided to take a nap 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.860
 Here is the point light lunch 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:52.560
 If you eat too heavy, you can't eat it and sleep awfully 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.610
 I decided to have a light lunch and take a nap 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.270
 Ne 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.200
 That Then Well that 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.180
 Ne 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:07.450
 I moved to a place near the company, so the total commuting time was shortened 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:12.879
 At night, I was able to go to bed early as well, so the sleeping time also increased 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:20.220
 Though in not the actual contents and serves as food field of training have changed almost nothing 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:22.680
 I will handle it in Kamine training . The result is that the barbell and the weight increase and the muscle increases by it. 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.860
 However 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.040
 In this case also to everyone's to with it 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.099
 By all means 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.109
 What I want to do is use of nap 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.710
 The ideal for a nap is 20 minutes 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.030
 This is that 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.450
 The sound study of sleep 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 I understand clearly but 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.370
 Rems mean you mean 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:55.150
 It is said that the body is resting Sleep and Rem Sleep is this 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:59.260
 That Tteyuu 20 minutes seems one of the units, so when are kneaded for 20 minutes 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.890
 Ne woke up awake from noon, it does not matter to work 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.890
 20 minutes is of good in fact that is not followed by its towards the 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:29.720
 here till 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:32.840
 It is with the feeling that you and Dari is that it alone has the same effect as sleep 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:39.280
 I allowed to recover the experiences I that body 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:44.790
 And also let your mind relax and make your muscles bigger 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.790
