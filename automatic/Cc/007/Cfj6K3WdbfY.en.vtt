00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.448
 Barça Kuduro - Translation: DumaKatalonii.pl 

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:10.426
 Barça Kuduro! 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.702
 Valdés is moving out 

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:18.653
 He plays Xavi 

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:20.309
 He controls Iniesta 

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.319
 And he gives it to Villa 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.098
 A la Pedrera 

00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:25.866
 Pretty free 

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.097
 How wonderful 

00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:29.958
 Barça Kuduro! 

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:31.564
 Until 2012 

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.234
 We have Guardiola 

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:35.024
 This is the time 

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:37.112
 To say "I am prolonging" 

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:38.827
 And there are titles 

00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:40.784
 we multiply 

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:42.508
 Everyone to the museum 

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.278
 not let it cool down 

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.766
 When Sunday comes, I pull out my flag to make it ready 

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.836
 I will come to Camp Nou to play together with Iniesta 

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:55.155
 And we travel all over Europe to give her Pedrera. 

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.959
 And 5-0 with Madrid, and Mourinho is complaining again. 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.038
 Valdés is moving out 

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:02.828
 He plays Xavi 

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.691
 He controls Iniesta 

00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:06.553
 And he gives it to Villa 

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:08.235
 A la Pedrera 

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.187
 Pretty free 

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:12.060
 How wonderful 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.845
 Barça Kuduro 

00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:15.773
 Mosaics in blaugrana colors, 

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.661
 the entire Camp Nou on gallium 

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.458
 I see the Champions League final 

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.296
 At Wembley for victory! 

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:23.191
 In basketball, it's not new, 

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:25.048
 the guys do not give and win anyone. 

00:01:25.048 --> 00:01:26.690
 Because we are Copa champions 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.605
 if you talk about indoor football. 

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:30.521
 Until 2012 

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:32.290
 We have Guardiola 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.021
 This is the time 

00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.923
 To say "I am prolonging" 

00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:38.215
 And there are titles 

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:39.863
 we multiply 

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:39.863
 we multiply 

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:41.670
 Everyone to the museum 

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:43.440
 not let it cool down 

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.450
 Oh, come on 

00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.310
 since 2004 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.090
 when the streak started 

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:52.860
 oh, oh, oh oh 

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.570
 when he says Pep, 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.560
 the whole universe is silent 

00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:58.360
 oh, oh, oh oh 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.530
 Barça Kuduro! 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.560
 He controls Iniesta 

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:07.440
 And he gives it to Villa 

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:09.220
 A la Pedrera 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.980
 Pretty free 

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:13.280
