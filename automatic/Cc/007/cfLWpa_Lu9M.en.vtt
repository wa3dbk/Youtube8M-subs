eating faced was the ability to read

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.119 
eating faced was the ability to read
without<00:00:38.750> without<00:00:39.750> any<00:00:39.989> strong<00:00:40.500> light<00:00:40.800> source

without without any strong light source
if<00:00:41.520> there's<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:42.090> enough<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
and we've been able to do that without

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.040 
and we've been able to do that without
making<00:01:02.350> any<00:01:02.680> compromises<00:01:03.550> on<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:04.270> reading

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
can see very very clear without any kind

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.320 
can see very very clear without any kind
of<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:11.080> problem<00:01:11.770> for<00:01:12.100> text<00:01:12.370> clarity<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.090> that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
of a problem for text clarity and that

of a problem for text clarity and that
was<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.570> real<00:01:13.840> big<00:01:14.260> challenge<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.860> overcome<00:01:14.890> but

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
was a real big challenge to overcome but

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.110 
was a real big challenge to overcome but
we<00:01:15.610> but<00:01:15.880> we<00:01:16.030> did<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.360> so<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:18.430> we<00:01:18.550> one<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.060> the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
we but we did it so what we one of the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.000 
we but we did it so what we one of the
ways<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.450> we<00:01:19.510> overcame<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.440> have<00:01:20.680> a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
ways that we overcame it is we have a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.550 
ways that we overcame it is we have a
high<00:01:21.610> resolution<00:01:22.270> screen<00:01:22.300> you're<00:01:23.200> on<00:01:23.380> this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.050 
device so says the shame is to touch
it's<00:01:26.380> higher<00:01:26.620> resolution<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.310> higher<00:01:27.490> yeah

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
it's higher resolution and higher yeah

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.980 
it's higher resolution and higher yeah
this<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.950> touch<00:01:29.950> was<00:01:30.160> 800<00:01:30.640> x<00:01:30.700> 600<00:01:30.970> 600<00:01:31.480> x<00:01:31.540> 800

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
this is a touch was 800 x 600 600 x 800

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.920 
this is a touch was 800 x 600 600 x 800
here<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.650> 1024<00:01:33.430> x<00:01:33.580> 750<00:01:34.180> Wow<00:01:34.300> okay<00:01:34.750> so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
here and this is 1024 x 750 Wow okay so

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
here and this is 1024 x 750 Wow okay so
it's<00:01:35.170> probably<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.950> think<00:01:36.250> it's<00:01:37.770> 212<00:01:38.770> DPI

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's probably I think it's 212 DPI

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's probably I think it's 212 DPI
versus<00:01:40.270> touch<00:01:40.720> was<00:01:40.990> 170<00:01:41.920> BPM<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:43.119> right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300
