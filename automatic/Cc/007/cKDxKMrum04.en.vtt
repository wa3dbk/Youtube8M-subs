a<00:00:12.570> replay<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.049> mine<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> be

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
a replay of mine and this is going to be

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.750 
a replay of mine and this is going to be
a<00:00:14.790> rather<00:00:15.210> short<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.750> sweet<00:00:15.990> game<00:00:16.260> indeed<00:00:16.830> now

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
a rather short and sweet game indeed now

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.570 
a rather short and sweet game indeed now
normally<00:00:18.510> again<00:00:19.260> mr.<00:00:19.650> short<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.369> would

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
normally again mr. short I would

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.330 
normally again mr. short I would
actually<00:00:20.779> pair<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.080> another<00:00:23.010> replay

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
actually pair it up with another replay

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.790 
actually pair it up with another replay
but<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> don't<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.210> anything<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.869> fits<00:00:25.439> with

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
but I don't have anything that fits with

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
but I don't have anything that fits with
this<00:00:26.039> particular<00:00:26.400> match<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.420> you're<00:00:27.449> going

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
this particular match and you're going

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
this particular match and you're going
to<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> point<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> mean<00:00:28.910> having

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to see the point of it I mean having

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.580 
to see the point of it I mean having
said<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.720> sure<00:00:31.109> well<00:00:31.380> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
said it's pretty sure well that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.540 
said it's pretty sure well that
obviously<00:00:31.830> means<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.829> do<00:00:34.829> rather

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
obviously means we're going to do rather

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.280 
obviously means we're going to do rather
well<00:00:35.700> rather<00:00:36.090> quickly<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> was<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
well rather quickly because if it was a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
well rather quickly because if it was a
terrible<00:00:37.980> crushing<00:00:38.610> very<00:00:38.879> quick<00:00:39.300> defeat<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
terrible crushing very quick defeat it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
terrible crushing very quick defeat it
would<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> unlikely<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> would<00:00:41.579> show<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
would be unlikely that I would show that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
would be unlikely that I would show that
as<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> replay<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.079> might<00:00:43.260> happen<00:00:43.440> during<00:00:43.770> one

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
as a replay it might happen during one

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.130 
as a replay it might happen during one
of<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.100> life<00:00:44.340> recorded<00:00:44.850> games<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:45.870> case

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
of my life recorded games in which case

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920 
of my life recorded games in which case
it<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.469> happens<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> happens<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it just happens as it happens but for a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
it just happens as it happens but for a
replay<00:00:49.559> I've<00:00:49.710> picked<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.219> well<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:51.149> had<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
replay I've picked out well first had to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.729 
replay I've picked out well first had to
be<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.629> bit<00:00:51.750> more<00:00:51.960> carefully<00:00:52.289> selected

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
be a little bit more carefully selected

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
be a little bit more carefully selected
and<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.520> odd<00:00:53.789> selection<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and it would be a very odd selection to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
and it would be a very odd selection to
make<00:00:54.750> indeed<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> using<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.239> big<00:00:57.420> gun

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
make indeed so this is using the big gun

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.709 
make indeed so this is using the big gun
155<00:00:58.530> mill<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.160> when<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> tune<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.090> snooze

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
155 mill and when the tune with snooze

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.359 
155 mill and when the tune with snooze
in<00:01:00.930> e75<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> cirque<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.699> his<00:01:02.969> conway<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
in e75 and cirque on in his conway and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
in e75 and cirque on in his conway and
my<00:01:05.369> results<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.450> gun<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.990> been

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
my results with this gun have been

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.940 
my results with this gun have been
somewhat<00:01:07.619> mixed<00:01:08.420> most<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> time<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:10.650> have

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
somewhat mixed most the time well i have

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
somewhat mixed most the time well i have
okay<00:01:11.520> games<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.150> maybe<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> couple<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
okay games I maybe do a couple of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.219 
okay games I maybe do a couple of
thousand<00:01:13.380> damage<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.880> tends<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
thousand damage but it tends to be a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.190 
thousand damage but it tends to be a
little<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.979> troll<00:01:17.310> site<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.820> terms<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
little on the troll site in terms of the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.999 
little on the troll site in terms of the
handling<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> accuracy<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.110> forth<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
handling the accuracy and so forth and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
handling the accuracy and so forth and
also<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> American

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
also because it is this kind of American

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
also because it is this kind of American
soft<00:01:25.979> hole<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.460> strong<00:01:27.000> turret<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.540> designed

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
soft hole but strong turret it designed

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.620 
soft hole but strong turret it designed
well<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:29.040> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.700> favors<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.420> maps

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
well it kind of favors some maps

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
well it kind of favors some maps
drastically<00:01:31.259> over<00:01:31.560> others<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.759> see

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
drastically over others as you can see

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.730 
drastically over others as you can see
the<00:01:33.659> matchmaking<00:01:34.079> couldn't<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.530> any<00:01:34.650> better

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the matchmaking couldn't be any better

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
the matchmaking couldn't be any better
the<00:01:35.280> map<00:01:35.520> couldn't<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.939> any<00:01:36.060> better<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the map couldn't be any better and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
the map couldn't be any better and
there's<00:01:36.659> only<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:36.869> artillery<00:01:37.439> per<00:01:37.619> team<00:01:38.240> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
there's only one artillery per team so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
there's only one artillery per team so
I've<00:01:39.329> already<00:01:39.479> had<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.259> nice<00:01:40.560> high<00:01:40.860> roll

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I've already had one very nice high roll

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
I've already had one very nice high roll
900<00:01:42.030> damage<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.600> there's<00:01:42.960> another<00:01:43.079> high<00:01:43.470> roll

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
900 damage and there's another high roll

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
900 damage and there's another high roll
not<00:01:43.920> quite<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.280> high<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.670> still<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.360> good

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
not quite as high but still pretty good

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
not quite as high but still pretty good
and<00:01:48.079> we<00:01:49.079> start<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.710> mean<00:01:50.149> it's<00:01:51.149> actually

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and we start off I mean it's actually

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
and we start off I mean it's actually
so-called<00:01:51.990> being<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.470> match<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.829> think

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so-called being in this match I think

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.940 
so-called being in this match I think
there<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.430> T<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.850> an<00:01:53.939> ex<00:01:54.060> vm<00:01:54.299> user<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.990> he<00:01:55.710> went

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there are T was an ex vm user so he went

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.530 
there are T was an ex vm user so he went
for<00:01:56.159> circle<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> best<00:01:56.939> player<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
for circle as the best player on the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.920 
for circle as the best player on the
team<00:01:58.250> black<00:01:59.250> men<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.670> was<00:02:00.030> entirely<00:02:00.390> free<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
team black men I was entirely free of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
team black men I was entirely free of
artillery<00:02:01.680> interference<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> yes<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
artillery interference and yes this is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.209 
artillery interference and yes this is
maybe<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.110> waste<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.530> shell<00:02:04.799> but

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
maybe a bit of a waste of a shell but

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.820 
maybe a bit of a waste of a shell but
it's<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.030> less<00:02:06.210> tank<00:02:06.540> firing<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:07.020> us

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
it's one less tank firing at us

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.240 
it's one less tank firing at us
so<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.010> was<00:02:10.220> quite<00:02:10.520> pleasant<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:11.770> also<00:02:12.770> had

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
so that was quite pleasant I also had

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.470 
so that was quite pleasant I also had
the<00:02:13.850> ability<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.630> sit<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.080> be<00:02:15.410> hold<00:02:15.890> down<00:02:16.100> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the ability to sit and be hold down and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.840 
the ability to sit and be hold down and
actually<00:02:17.480> sit<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:19.100> gun<00:02:19.430> because<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
actually sit and a my gun because the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.930 
actually sit and a my gun because the
handling<00:02:20.240> on<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.590> well<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.800> price<00:02:22.010> UK<00:02:22.280> for

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
handling on this well the price UK for

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.580 
handling on this well the price UK for
having<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.480> lot<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.930> damage<00:02:24.290> with<00:02:24.740> one<00:02:25.250> shell<00:02:25.610> is

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
having a lot of damage with one shell is

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.720 
having a lot of damage with one shell is
you<00:02:27.590> don't<00:02:27.710> have<00:02:27.830> particularly<00:02:28.190> good<00:02:28.370> reload

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
you don't have particularly good reload

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.310 
you don't have particularly good reload
and<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.120> don't<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:29.600> particularly<00:02:30.080> good

and you don't have particularly good
handling<00:02:31.130> characteristics<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> that's<00:02:33.230> just

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
handling characteristics and that's just

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.400 
handling characteristics and that's just
fair<00:02:33.680> enough<00:02:33.920> us<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.400> balancing<00:02:35.050> factor<00:02:36.050> you

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
handling in the game wouldn't exactly be

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.190

very<00:02:48.170> fair<00:02:48.490> now<00:02:49.490> fortunately<00:02:49.820> snooze<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.600> think

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
very fair now fortunately snooze I think

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.500 
very fair now fortunately snooze I think
he<00:02:51.340> got<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.370> little<00:02:52.430> bit<00:02:52.700> overconfident<00:02:53.030> or<00:02:53.450> he

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
he got a little bit overconfident or he

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.770 
he got a little bit overconfident or he
just<00:02:53.630> pushed<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.930> little<00:02:54.020> bit<00:02:54.230> too<00:02:54.380> far<00:02:54.680> forward

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
just pushed a little bit too far forward

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.250 
just pushed a little bit too far forward
but<00:02:56.860> because<00:02:57.860> he<00:02:58.280> was<00:02:58.490> then<00:02:58.700> sort<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.300> alone<00:02:59.630> we

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
but because he was then sort of alone we

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.530 
but because he was then sort of alone we
were<00:03:00.380> all<00:03:00.709> behind<00:03:01.400> him<00:03:01.610> but<00:03:01.940> because<00:03:02.090> we<00:03:02.390> were

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
were all behind him but because we were

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.050 
were all behind him but because we were
all<00:03:02.720> behind<00:03:02.930> him<00:03:03.080> well<00:03:03.490> yeah<00:03:04.490> they<00:03:04.760> didn't<00:03:04.970> go

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
all behind him well yeah they didn't go

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.610 
all behind him well yeah they didn't go
so<00:03:05.209> well<00:03:05.240> for<00:03:05.390> him<00:03:05.540> unfortunately<00:03:05.900> now<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.470> was

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
so well for him unfortunately now I was

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.750 
so well for him unfortunately now I was
wondering<00:03:06.860> why<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:06.950> couldn't<00:03:07.160> aim<00:03:07.520> straight

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
wondering why I couldn't aim straight

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.830 
wondering why I couldn't aim straight
there<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.150> because<00:03:08.300> there<00:03:08.420> was<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> liver

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
there it's because there was a liver

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.960 
there it's because there was a liver
grinding<00:03:09.410> into<00:03:09.530> my<00:03:09.650> side<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.190> also<00:03:10.610> liked<00:03:10.850> that

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
grinding into my side I also liked that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.520 
grinding into my side I also liked that
panic<00:03:11.330> shot<00:03:11.570> from<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> tiger<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.260> when<00:03:12.440> he

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
panic shot from the tiger to when he

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.470 
panic shot from the tiger to when he
realized<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.280> was<00:03:13.820> looking<00:03:14.060> at<00:03:14.209> him<00:03:14.330> with

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
realized that I was looking at him with

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.090 
realized that I was looking at him with
a<00:03:14.510> big<00:03:14.690> gun<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.170> was<00:03:15.290> definitely<00:03:15.560> an<00:03:15.800> oh<00:03:15.920> crap

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
a big gun it was definitely an oh crap

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.140 
a big gun it was definitely an oh crap
moment<00:03:16.250> there<00:03:18.130> now<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.190> enemy<00:03:19.550> team<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:20.030> you

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
moment there now the enemy team as you

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.350 
moment there now the enemy team as you
can<00:03:20.270> see<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:21.489> collapsing<00:03:22.489> rapidly<00:03:22.970> at<00:03:23.209> this

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
can see is collapsing rapidly at this

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.820 
can see is collapsing rapidly at this
point<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.900> mean<00:03:24.110> seven<00:03:25.100> 63<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:25.700> we're<00:03:26.690> just

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
point I mean seven 63 but we're just

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.900 
point I mean seven 63 but we're just
look<00:03:27.830> at<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:27.980> situation<00:03:28.160> on<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.580> mini-map

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
look at the situation on the mini-map

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.280 
look at the situation on the mini-map
we're<00:03:29.660> absolutely<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:31.780> plowing<00:03:32.780> through

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
we're absolutely just plowing through

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.550 
we're absolutely just plowing through
the<00:03:33.320> rate<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.100> knots<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:36.290> I've<00:03:36.410> actually

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
the rate of knots and I've actually

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.250 
the rate of knots and I've actually
managed<00:03:37.040> already<00:03:37.400> over<00:03:38.120> 4,000<00:03:38.600> damage<00:03:38.840> just

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
managed already over 4,000 damage just

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.949 
managed already over 4,000 damage just
ordinarily<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.310> would<00:03:40.370> be<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.850> really<00:03:40.959> really

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
ordinarily this would be a really really

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.420 
ordinarily this would be a really really
good<00:03:42.260> game<00:03:42.500> for<00:03:42.650> me<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.980> teeth<00:03:43.160> 30

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
good game for me in the teeth 30

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.330 
good game for me in the teeth 30
managing<00:03:44.060> 4000<00:03:44.930> time<00:03:45.050> at<00:03:45.170> all<00:03:45.350> okay<00:03:45.980> bit<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.220> a

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
managing 4000 time at all okay bit of a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.040 
managing 4000 time at all okay bit of a
more<00:03:46.640> ranging<00:03:47.030> shot<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.750> really<00:03:48.019> need

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
more ranging shot and I really need

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.140 
more ranging shot and I really need
there<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.860> go<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.070> back<00:03:49.220> principles<00:03:49.670> board<00:03:49.940> I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
there we go the back principles board I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.820 
there we go the back principles board I
got<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.750> bit<00:03:50.870> less<00:03:51.019> damage<00:03:51.290> but<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.470> do<00:03:51.560> get<00:03:51.739> the

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
got a bit less damage but I do get the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.650 
got a bit less damage but I do get the
kill<00:03:52.040> yeah<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.030> would<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.209> been<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.330> bit<00:03:53.480> bad

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
kill yeah it would have been a bit bad

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.940 
kill yeah it would have been a bit bad
if<00:03:53.780> I'd<00:03:53.870> pull<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.110> trigger<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.470> put<00:03:54.680> one<00:03:54.800> into

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
if I'd pull the trigger and put one into

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
the t54 I feel like eight times out of

the t54 I feel like eight times out of
ten<00:05:05.830> maybe<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.370> would<00:05:06.640> have<00:05:06.760> just<00:05:07.000> waste

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
ten maybe that would have just waste

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.300 
ten maybe that would have just waste
over<00:05:07.960> his<00:05:08.080> head<00:05:08.260> or<00:05:08.470> gone<00:05:08.620> into<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.890> ground<00:05:09.160> or

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
over his head or gone into the ground or

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.590 
over his head or gone into the ground or
it<00:05:09.400> would<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:09.580> missed<00:05:09.700> entirely<00:05:10.180> and

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
it would have missed entirely and

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.460 
it would have missed entirely and
instead<00:05:11.640> somehow<00:05:12.640> on<00:05:13.000> this<00:05:13.390> particular<00:05:13.780> day<00:05:14.020> I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
instead somehow on this particular day I

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.710

target with a very high damage shell if
it<00:05:47.290> means<00:05:47.680> you've<00:05:47.890> got<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.100> long<00:05:48.310> reload<00:05:48.820> and

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
it means you've got a long reload and

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.180 
it means you've got a long reload and
there<00:05:49.240> are<00:05:49.360> higher<00:05:49.600> damage<00:05:50.230> higher<00:05:50.950> health

there are higher damage higher health
targets<00:05:51.640> around<00:05:51.910> then<00:05:52.390> it's<00:05:52.660> not<00:05:52.840> always<00:05:53.080> the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
targets around then it's not always the

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.890 
targets around then it's not always the
right<00:05:54.070> thing<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.520> do<00:05:54.610> in<00:05:54.760> fact<00:05:54.880> in<00:05:55.540> that

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
right thing to do in fact in that

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.480 
right thing to do in fact in that
scenario<00:05:56.169> it's<00:05:56.650> hardly<00:05:56.860> ever<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.310> right

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
scenario it's hardly ever the right

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.010 
scenario it's hardly ever the right
thing<00:05:57.730> to<00:05:57.910> do<00:05:58.030> but<00:05:58.300> in<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:58.600> particular

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
thing to do but in that particular

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.450 
thing to do but in that particular
instance<00:05:59.620> there<00:05:59.800> wasn't<00:06:00.010> anything<00:06:00.160> else<00:06:00.310> to

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
instance there wasn't anything else to

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.790 
instance there wasn't anything else to
immediately<00:06:00.850> shoot<00:06:01.150> at<00:06:01.360> so<00:06:01.630> it's<00:06:02.230> fine<00:06:02.500> but

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
immediately shoot at so it's fine but

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.990 
immediately shoot at so it's fine but
anyway<00:06:03.730> still<00:06:04.419> I<00:06:05.220> wish<00:06:06.220> every<00:06:06.580> day<00:06:06.610> was<00:06:06.940> like

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
anyway still I wish every day was like

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.540 
anyway still I wish every day was like
that<00:06:07.450> but<00:06:07.780> that's<00:06:08.140> not<00:06:08.470> World<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:09.040> Tanks<00:06:09.220> that

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
that but that's not World of Tanks that

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.670 
that but that's not World of Tanks that
stop<00:06:09.940> how<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:10.390> works<00:06:10.660> unfortunately<00:06:11.440> so<00:06:11.560> I'm

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
stop how it works unfortunately so I'm

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.310 
stop how it works unfortunately so I'm
going<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.860> cherish<00:06:12.280> this<00:06:12.520> one<00:06:12.850> and<00:06:13.320> hopefully

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
going to cherish this one and hopefully

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.320 
going to cherish this one and hopefully
at<00:06:14.620> some<00:06:14.650> point<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.220> will<00:06:15.520> ace<00:06:15.700> this<00:06:15.970> thing<00:06:16.180> and

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
at some point I will ace this thing and

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.180 
at some point I will ace this thing and
it'll<00:06:16.419> probably<00:06:16.780> be<00:06:17.169> an<00:06:17.290> even<00:06:17.590> better<00:06:17.710> game<00:06:18.040> of

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
it'll probably be an even better game of

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.710 
it'll probably be an even better game of
this<00:06:18.310> well<00:06:18.520> it'll<00:06:18.790> have<00:06:18.940> to<00:06:19.330> be<00:06:19.450> almost

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
this well it'll have to be almost

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.159 
this well it'll have to be almost
certainly<00:06:20.260> but<00:06:21.150> yeah<00:06:22.150> so<00:06:22.419> apologies<00:06:22.960> for<00:06:23.110> the

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
certainly but yeah so apologies for the

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.750 
certainly but yeah so apologies for the
shortness<00:06:23.500> of<00:06:23.590> this<00:06:23.740> one<00:06:23.950> but

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
shortness of this one but

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.470 
shortness of this one but
I<00:06:25.710> I<00:06:26.710> think<00:06:27.310> that<00:06:27.400> this<00:06:27.520> one<00:06:27.670> was<00:06:27.850> worthy<00:06:28.330> of

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
I I think that this one was worthy of

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.520 
I I think that this one was worthy of
showing<00:06:28.750> on<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:28.990> challengers<00:06:29.350> for<00:06:29.440> the
