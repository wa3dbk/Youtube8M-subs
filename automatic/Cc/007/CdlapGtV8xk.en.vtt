00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and you can see right there the the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.260 
and you can see right there the the
playback<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:19.140> better<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:20.270> two

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
playback is actually better than my two

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.679

gigahertz<00:01:22.850> acklin's<00:01:24.470> pipeline<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
gigahertz acklin's pipeline with the

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.179 
gigahertz acklin's pipeline with the
Ubuntu<00:01:29.180> desktop<00:01:30.180> computer<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
Ubuntu desktop computer and so all this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.859 
Ubuntu desktop computer and so all this
display<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.570> device<00:01:33.720> right

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
display it from this little device right

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
display it from this little device right
here<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> basically<00:01:35.430> proves<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.500> that's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
here so it basically proves that that's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.380 
here so it basically proves that that's
because<00:01:39.360> Android<00:01:39.870> is<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.140> best<00:01:41.120> YouTube<00:01:42.120> set

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
click here and we can see it is 720p at

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.479 
click here and we can see it is 720p at
around<00:02:51.120> 2<00:02:51.480> megabit<00:02:51.900> per<00:02:51.930> second<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.430> is

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
around 2 megabit per second this is

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.580 
around 2 megabit per second this is
basically<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.450> quality<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.380> make

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
basically the quality that you do make

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.330 
basically the quality that you do make
encodes<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:57.080> if<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.260> exit<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:59.100> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
encodes in and if I exit it like this

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.259 
encodes in and if I exit it like this
and<00:03:03.620> yeah<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.860> mentoring<00:03:05.280> machine<00:03:05.640> so

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
and yeah this mentoring machine so

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.960 
and yeah this mentoring machine so
basically<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:07.260> means<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
basically it means that this is a
