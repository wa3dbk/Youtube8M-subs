least you get to see what my camera
looks<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> bottom<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.979> little

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
looks like at the bottom of a little

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
looks like at the bottom of a little
pond<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.820> Port<00:01:51.090> Credit<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.079> I'm<00:01:52.320> spinning

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pond here in Port Credit so I'm spinning

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
pond here in Port Credit so I'm spinning
it<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> bring<00:01:54.270> it

it around and now I'm going to bring it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
it around and now I'm going to bring it
up<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> surface<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.180> are<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
up to the surface so there we are on the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.779 
up to the surface so there we are on the
surface<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> pond

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.999 

right<00:02:01.789> on<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.030> surface<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.710> that's<00:02:03.770> what

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
right on the surface and and that's what

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.649 
right on the surface and and that's what
it's<00:02:04.159> like<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.670> get<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:04.939> see<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.090> geese<00:02:05.390> out

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
it's like you get to see the geese out

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.529 
it's like you get to see the geese out
there<00:02:05.929> floating<00:02:06.439> around<00:02:06.819> anyway<00:02:07.819> that's<00:02:08.420> my

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
there floating around anyway that's my

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.749 
there floating around anyway that's my
little<00:02:08.869> test<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.440> camera<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.399> that's

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
little test for the camera but that's

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.280 
little test for the camera but that's
just<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:11.030> little<00:02:11.209> test<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.810> little<00:02:12.080> pond

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
just a little test in a little pond

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:52.560 
just a little test in a little pond
let's<00:02:12.830> go<00:02:13.010> somewhere<00:02:13.340> big

here at the cry river it's got to be

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.250 
here at the cry river it's got to be
pretty<00:03:16.340> deep<00:03:16.700> down<00:03:17.000> they're<00:03:17.300> probably<00:03:17.810> dark

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
pretty deep down they're probably dark

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.290 
pretty deep down they're probably dark
maybe<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.650> can't<00:03:18.950> see<00:03:19.220> anything<00:03:19.490> but<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:20.060> got<00:03:20.270> to

go big I got to put this camera down

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.850 
go big I got to put this camera down
really<00:03:22.760> deep<00:03:22.910> into<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> water<00:03:23.840> just<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.590> see

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
really deep into the water just to see

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.950 
really deep into the water just to see
what<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.670> if<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.180> may<00:03:26.270> be<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.480> fish<00:03:26.780> will

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
we go again putting this down into the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.750 
we go again putting this down into the
water<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.600> we<00:03:39.140> hit<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.410> surface<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.160> down<00:03:40.400> we

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
water and we hit the surface and down we

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.740 
water and we hit the surface and down we
go<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.570> don't<00:03:41.900> know<00:03:41.990> how<00:03:42.020> deep<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:43.750> but

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
go so I don't know how deep this is but

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.120 
go so I don't know how deep this is but
we're<00:03:44.930> definitely<00:03:45.110> going<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:45.620> down<00:03:45.830> pretty

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
we're definitely going to go down pretty

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.600 
we're definitely going to go down pretty
deep<00:03:46.220> here<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:47.320> got<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.470> stick<00:03:48.800> with<00:03:49.040> me<00:03:49.250> just<00:03:49.490> to

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
deep here I got to stick with me just to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.260 
deep here I got to stick with me just to
put<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.360> out<00:03:50.570> further<00:03:50.930> into<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:52.030> away<00:03:53.030> from

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
put this out further into the away from

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.950 
put this out further into the away from
the<00:03:53.390> actual<00:03:53.750> war<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.120> right<00:03:56.330> now<00:03:56.360> we're<00:03:56.720> at<00:03:56.750> the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
the actual war so right now we're at the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.710 
the actual war so right now we're at the
surface<00:03:57.610> now<00:03:58.610> let's<00:03:58.820> see<00:03:59.000> how<00:03:59.150> far<00:03:59.420> down<00:03:59.480> we

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
surface now let's see how far down we

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.780 
surface now let's see how far down we
can<00:04:00.110> go<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:03.350> still<00:04:03.590> see<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:06.580> looks<00:04:07.580> like

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
can go I can still see it looks like

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.090 
can go I can still see it looks like
we're<00:04:08.000> down<00:04:08.120> five<00:04:08.840> feet<00:04:09.140> OH<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.650> waves<00:04:09.860> are

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
we're down five feet OH the waves are

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.250 
we're down five feet OH the waves are
hitting<00:04:10.400> at<00:04:10.550> it<00:04:10.670> bouncing<00:04:11.150> around<00:04:14.050> so<00:04:15.050> let's

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
hitting at it bouncing around so let's

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.240 
hitting at it bouncing around so let's
go<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.920> can<00:04:16.790> barely<00:04:17.030> see<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.570> now<00:04:17.780> it's<00:04:18.680> down

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
go I can barely see it now it's down

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.250 
go I can barely see it now it's down
into<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:19.730> credit<00:04:20.120> river<00:04:20.299> watch<00:04:20.840> this<00:04:21.140> is

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
into the credit river watch this is

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:30.600 
into the credit river watch this is
almost<00:04:21.500> lake<00:04:21.770> ontario<00:04:22.010> at<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.670> spot

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.890 

and<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:31.760> right<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:32.060> against<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.450> edge<00:04:32.600> for

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and it's right up against the edge for

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.480 
and it's right up against the edge for
the<00:04:32.990> war<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:36.440> see<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.770> down<00:04:36.950> there<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.310> don't
