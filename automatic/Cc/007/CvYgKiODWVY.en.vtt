00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.830
 good evening everyone here is a novel sound 9 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.480
 Vasily he Vasily homemade transceiver 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 radio 76 according to the radio magazine scheme so 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.830
 sixth year 6 and 7 numbers as far as I am 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:28.609
 I remember that I took off the top steel cover 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.609
 painted what we see inside 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.940
 this is the main board 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 transceiver chips used 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.210
 122 series as in the original remade on 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.530
 mixer 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 there is 1 mixer here 2 mixer mf 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.030
 used from a set of quartz which in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.809
 Soviet time 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.969
 produced and circulated to services and bargaining 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:06.750
 here is the basis of the receive band filter here 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.960
 a3 outline on Chinese coils from 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 chinese magnets 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.790
 here is a band pass filter 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 transfer main dress change 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.880
 touched only the inclusion of mixers 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.880
 there is an upgrade from 88 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.479
 spread a little fee for himself put 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:39.030
 gt 420 404 transistors lying left 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 the transistor here is the first cascade apache i 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.820
 it is not put here as in the original 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.820
 put a ruler here 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 mainly used 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.979
 Soviet radio components and parts from 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.850
 chinese mannitol capacitors 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 film and electrolytic 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.780
 new capacitors used 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.799
 purchased 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.790
 here is gpd i used from gpd 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.500
 variable capacitor coil 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.060
 on 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.790
 potted with silver 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.330
 wired gray wound on quartz price 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.599
 500 kilohertz gpd used from Russia 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.430
 for 76 m 2 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.840
 it was done here which switches example 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 transmission switches gpd and reference wind 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.000
 I have one switch here 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.239
 so that you can connect to the reception 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.260
 separate antenna toggle switch is a relay 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.970
 which closes 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:54.629
 audio input casanova receive filter on 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:03.109
 ground so here everything set is meter 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:08.269
 here here is the fee from the metro fee aru 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:10.859
 here is collected stream or forest meter 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.690
 after band band in filter 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:20.870
 Transmission signal transmission goes to amplify 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:25.519
 power I gathered it in a different way 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.769
 under the scheme 1 to from the hip of the north to the hut 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.299
 foreign magazines are completely on 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:37.400
 transistors without 170 on habits 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.400
 isolated shutter here them here once 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:48.209
 two three 4 5 6 6 transistors 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:54.569
 here it is a preamplifier 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:59.430
 power goes further matching stage 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:03.769
 and terminal cascade here three transistor 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:08.480
 waves of fear or included here in he gives 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.879
 exactly 10 volts on a 50 ohm load 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.239
 but we have enough 10 volt resistor 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:19.250
 It turns out 2 vata for local connections to 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.830
 thousands of kilometers they hear me 57 give 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.260
 depending on the passage here and then 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.820
 little shawl goes 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.270
 switching board transfer here 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.000
 riley 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.310
 there is one that connects the head 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.710
 as the measuring device of the meter then 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.120
 How do I connect it to accept that Liu 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.980
 connected to the power amplifier to 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.140
 could see if you are very 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.920
 output voltage during transmission is very 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.960
 helps for control here and here still 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.490
 one release worth that throws 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.910
 antenna jack 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.390
 antenna between receptions transmission 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:08.810
 it turns out I'm here once two three 4 5 years 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:12.730
 weight 49 consumption received at the reception 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.770
 about 70 milliamps to transfer 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.040
 400 milliamps turned out such a card 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:32.240
 apparatus 2 wadded as it sounds to me very 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:33.080
 like here actually pen here 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.620
 settings 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.620
 volume and gain by h 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:50.830
 rear two antenna jacks power socket 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.850
 toggle switch which switch 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.190
 additionally includes an antenna for 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.330
 reception and as a tangent 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:03.970
 used tangent from the radio station 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:09.740
 the carat that I built the microphone dungeon 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:16.070
 here is glued in andre here and so 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:19.730
 works thank you all for your attention here 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.790
 there was a transceiver for 76 see you in 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.790
 on air
