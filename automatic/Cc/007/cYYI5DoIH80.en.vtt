00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.929
 to the press conference after our game 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.519
 against the end result one to one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 next to me the two coaches costa 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 fetus and markus of 1 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.529
 the guest trainer has the first one as usual 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.619
 Please have a good time to play the game 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.890
 started to run ball very well 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 opponents we also run a lot 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430
 knew it would not be easy though 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 when the lions are as deep as they are 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 then I have been confessed too 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.739
 seen how hard it was last night 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 despite high quality 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 all low-level team too 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.420
 play and until the offense we have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.309
 that made quite good in my opinion 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.440
 we wanted to wanted to play patiently 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 ball through your own rows quickly 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 play waiting for the moment 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 if something comes up and it has changed 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 as revealed the first chance of kerim 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.219
 the in which one does not use it again 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.170
 have and after a standard situation 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.250
 I am a very curious opponent 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.840
 like 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 that certainly has the lion in the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.830
 cards played we are with residue 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140
 have gone to the half time 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.369
 again made supposedly but 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.759
 ever worse sheet still a good one 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.920
 play and I have to say 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.869
 our boys try everything they have 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.150
 We tried to know the quality of 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 munich 60 that you with adlung with 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.790
 okotie with yannick strong some players 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.960
 that can be very much quality in there 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.750
 there is that one also times such a 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.790
 can drive and can get 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.390
 So we are already at risk 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.340
 played in the front and the chance is up 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.929
 then used by 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.429
 rom jensen was not recycled 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.679
 I have to say that one thing was fundamental 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.210
 one more will say he still 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.560
 have scored this one goal 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.810
 with a bit of luck you would still have 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.459
 but winning the game could be that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.799
 I have been to much of the good with 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.290
 Not satisfied with the result 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.590
 attitude and with the effort with the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.920
 I think the guys played today 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.870
 Can not blame and you have to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.670
 We also think twice 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.799
 substitute money 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.260
 19 years is hopeful 21 plan 21 jakob 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.079
 Today then at the end of the youngest 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.569
 team in this season 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.799
 and we will continue on our way 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.400
 we are still at the finals 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.319
 work 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.500
 We will now do our utmost that 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.239
 last game in front of a home audience 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.069
 accordingly to play that we too 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.220
 Home win that in good with us 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.980
 Feel everyone celebrating Christmas together 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.500
 can and then rest a bit and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.250
 Continue to visit in the new year 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:07.579
 attack 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:08.989
 thank you very much we finally knew 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.019
 that we are on a very self-confident 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.040
 and also very very start and play 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.019
 very flexible first fck meet 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.139
 we do not have that easy ourselves 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.940
 situation 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.010
 I have to say the team has 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.340
 the first second on a lot 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.310
 many have fought selflessly 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.310
 things that we set ourselves 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.109
 excellently implemented 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.130
 I think I have the right chances 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.109
 we do not allow anything long time 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.049
 then we go into the lead, namely 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.389
 clear that loud then more 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.609
 we will also have the game shares 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.980
 have deliberately submitted 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.680
 But we also knew about our strength 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.340
 that we strike ice-cold at any time 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.700
 can 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.769
 with our quality 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:06.519
 We succeeded after halftime 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.170
 we have the game relatively well 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.940
 I checked the bullet on the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.110
 long post passes in the head 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.859
 right after the break but then in 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.579
 the consequence I think that we 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.250
 or I wish we could 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.370
 one or the other promising 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.070
 situation that has come up to us 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.710
 use it to do the 2 0 of course 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.330
 also to get in the game pure 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.440
 even more clarity to have in it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.790
 at 0 1 against such a strong opponent 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.919
 're running you always risk that you again 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.790
 get a gate and my certain 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.979
 hectic since I have a scene in my head where 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.840
 marius wolf is an excellent player 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.550
 and sippel keeps the class and how 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.710
 That's what you wish you to be 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.669
 the possibilities and the spaces you 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.350
 then you just get used to that 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.650
 Finally, the sack too 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.139
 We did not succeed in doing that 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.610
 succeeded and so is the opponent with 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.260
 his danger and me too with his 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.500
 Substitutions, of course, always in the game 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.410
 And unfortunately it was a standard situation 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.830
 The us then shortly before the end of two 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.200
 I have to add more points 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.030
 also we are finally with the 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.520
 result not satisfied we wanted 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.310
 win 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.889
 we said in advance with all 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.070
 also makes our fans here before 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.470
 Give Christmas home win and 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.780
 that's why we are a bit annoyed 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.789
 about that 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.190
 But I have to say how the team 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:50.590
 has shown itself today from the moral of 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.990
 the willpower and the like 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.250
 also presented himself as a group 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.880
 the place in a really difficult 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.010
 phase and after a difficult last 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.530
 home game I found then already 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.260
 Noteworthy our goal is 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.740
 to drive leipzig and there too 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:14.830
 then take points 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:16.389
 right to attack in the back round what 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.430
 I would like to say at this point 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.710
 and what I also found remarkable when 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.020
 me at the costa just about young players 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.970
 has spoken on we have here 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.550
 Sometimes the discussion needs us 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.110
 these discussions will make that 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.360
 right is so many too young too 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.440
 put 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.050
 I have to say I have two today 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:41.110
 naughty boy seen on the side 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:43.000
 with maxi wittek and marius wolf the yes 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.639
 the really clever also partially 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.120
 have done really rotten like that 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:53.110
 actually 60 manner is also implemented 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.780
 have and I think this way with 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.819
 to go young people is for one 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.819
 Verein as well as 1860 Munich 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:04.210
 right way and have my trust 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.740
 these players and today i want to go next 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.389
 a special team effort 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.960
 to emphasize these two again 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.960
 Thank you very much
