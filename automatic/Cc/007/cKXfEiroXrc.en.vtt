00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
feel balanced everything else comes into

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.690 
feel balanced everything else comes into
place<00:02:56.050> as<00:02:56.260> well<00:02:56.410> are<00:02:56.620> there<00:02:56.800> misconceptions

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
about this to people theta perhaps it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.020 
about this to people theta perhaps it
will<00:02:59.530> cure<00:02:59.890> things<00:03:00.280> or<00:03:00.580> something<00:03:00.880> like<00:03:00.970> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
will cure things or something like that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.600 
will cure things or something like that
well<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.989> course<00:03:02.019> I'm<00:03:02.410> people<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:03.040> go<00:03:03.340> for

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
well of course I'm people that go for

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.820 
well of course I'm people that go for
reiki<00:03:03.940> sometimes<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:04.810> just<00:03:04.840> want<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.290> feel

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
reiki sometimes they just want to feel

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.050 
reiki sometimes they just want to feel
calm<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.310> take<00:03:06.550> some<00:03:06.730> time<00:03:06.910> out<00:03:06.940> for

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
calm just take some time out for

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.850 
calm just take some time out for
themselves<00:03:07.330> but<00:03:07.600> others<00:03:07.930> come<00:03:08.500> with<00:03:08.530> very

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
themselves but others come with very

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.610 
themselves but others come with very
serious<00:03:09.160> problems<00:03:09.910> on<00:03:10.120> illness<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.170> they

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
serious problems on illness and they

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.960 
serious problems on illness and they
really<00:03:12.010> want<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.220> see<00:03:12.370> results<00:03:12.790> right<00:03:12.910> away

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
really want to see results right away

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.720 
really want to see results right away
but<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:13.989> it's<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.620> takes<00:03:14.920> time<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.459> it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
but this is it's it takes time and it

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.880 
but this is it's it takes time and it
depends<00:03:16.060> on<00:03:16.180> each<00:03:16.330> person's<00:03:16.810> situation<00:03:17.110> right

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
depends on each person's situation right

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.470 
depends on each person's situation right
and<00:03:18.160> what's<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> training<00:03:18.730> leg<00:03:18.880> how<00:03:19.150> long<00:03:19.330> is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
something like this it really depends on

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.320 
something like this it really depends on
