huh<00:01:20.939> sounds<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> lot<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> old<00:01:21.960> tired

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
huh sounds a lot like the old tired
formula<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.040> far<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.119> said

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
formula so far right but like I said

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
formula so far right but like I said
it's<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> game<00:01:24.900> field<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.560> drastically

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it's the game field that's drastically

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.429 
it's the game field that's drastically
different<00:01:26.520> after<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.240> introductory<00:01:27.810> area<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
different after the introductory area to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
different after the introductory area to
get<00:01:28.560> used<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> controls<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.909> major

high<00:02:36.439> at<00:02:36.650> best<00:02:36.889> I<00:02:37.129> thought<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.549> al<00:02:37.790> was<00:02:38.120> just

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
high at best I thought this al was just

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.479 
high at best I thought this al was just
gigantic<00:02:38.959> but<00:02:39.439> really<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:39.829> more<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.159> Ori

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
gigantic but really it's more that Ori

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.039 
gigantic but really it's more that Ori
is<00:02:40.730> absolutely<00:02:41.510> tiny

is absolutely tiny
however<00:02:42.379> Ori<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.889> very<00:02:43.310> fast<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.060> floaty<00:02:44.599> he

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
however Ori is very fast and floaty he

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.360 
however Ori is very fast and floaty he
controls<00:02:45.169> easily<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.799> never<00:02:45.980> lets<00:02:46.280> the

hard sections without any trouble and I

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.970 
hard sections without any trouble and I
realized<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:06.020> was<00:05:06.350> limited<00:05:06.650> in<00:05:06.890> the

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
beginning it just never felt that way

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.480 
beginning it just never felt that way
when<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.930> would<00:05:09.140> revisit<00:05:09.590> old<00:05:09.710> locations<00:05:10.310> to

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
get hidden collectables I was breezing

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.540

earlier<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.360> realized<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.020> game<00:05:15.140> was

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
earlier and I realized that the game was

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.110 
earlier and I realized that the game was
only<00:05:15.470> giving<00:05:15.860> me<00:05:15.890> a<00:05:16.010> piece<00:05:16.310> of<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.670> true<00:05:16.880> power

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
only giving me a piece of the true power

I<00:05:17.240> would<00:05:17.420> have<00:05:17.660> eventually<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.380> yet<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.650> never

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
I would have eventually and yet I never

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.890 
I would have eventually and yet I never
felt<00:05:19.250> limited<00:05:19.700> it's<00:05:19.970> like<00:05:20.240> Ori<00:05:20.480> just<00:05:20.780> took

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
think of it this way instead of having

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.110
