 female consultations that too 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.979
 important today 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.569
 electronic registry is only 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.010

 already long enough medical institutions 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.730
 are conducted electronically year urn cards 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.760
 patients thanks to constant communication with 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.080

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.220
 prescribed medications but all 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.250
 same electronic registry 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.080
 closest if I may say so 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.239
 residents of the city 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.719
 the main goal which pursues exactly 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.700
 introduction of electronic 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.349
 registries this 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.129
 increase the availability of medical services 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.369
 non-working population 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.439
 for those citizens who do not have 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.049
 the rights 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.149
 enough time to 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.799
 to come specifically to these institutions to 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.499
 get some ticket to sign up 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:49.859
 appointment 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.909
 remote prostheses because they 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.939
 possibility of excuse a number of point time 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.869
 what exactly 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.879
 to schedule 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.160
 and instructive 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.609
 need a player 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.389
 and I'm with re 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.530
 Medvedev yourself 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.670
 registry to record patients 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.240
 applied by the recorder to 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.819
 specific hour and purpose 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.979
 zenith need participation children up 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.379
 receiving 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.980
 so on we have an electronic 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.439
 reception calendars 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.949

 in which consultation of the urologist is required 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.889

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.989
 usually the registry stand in line 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.409
