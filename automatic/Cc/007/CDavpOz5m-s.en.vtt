watching<00:00:34.739> resting<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.309> time<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:36.030> had

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
watching resting at the time we had

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
watching resting at the time we had
cable<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.440> not<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.680> cable<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> America

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
cable it's not like cable in America

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.290 
cable it's not like cable in America
it's<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.239> basic<00:00:39.930> sky<00:00:40.230> package<00:00:40.770> cable
