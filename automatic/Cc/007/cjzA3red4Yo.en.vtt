00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
hey guys and today we're gonna talk

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.410 
hey guys and today we're gonna talk
about<00:00:22.619> our<00:00:22.890> rattling<00:00:23.880> crypt<00:00:24.240> prop<00:00:29.630> oh<00:00:30.630> sorry

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
about our rattling crypt prop oh sorry

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.400 
about our rattling crypt prop oh sorry
so<00:00:34.489> when<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.610> were<00:00:35.730> doing<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> maze<00:00:36.210> last<00:00:37.079> year

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so when we were doing the maze last year

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.220 
so when we were doing the maze last year
we<00:00:37.829> thought<00:00:38.040> hey<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.850> had<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> whole<00:00:39.899> wall

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
we thought hey we had this whole wall

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.450 
we thought hey we had this whole wall
lined<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.370> crypts<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.629> hung<00:00:42.840> up

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
lined with these crypts that we hung up

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.010 
lined with these crypts that we hung up
we<00:00:44.460> should<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.300> make<00:00:45.719> noise

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
we should have one of these make noise

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
we should have one of these make noise
and<00:00:46.350> scare<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> heck<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> people<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.670> they

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and scare the heck out of people as they

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.040 
and scare the heck out of people as they
walk<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.270> one<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> several<00:00:51.600> crypts

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
walk by this is a one of several crypts

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
walk by this is a one of several crypts
that<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.350> fabricated<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.520> screwed<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that we fabricated and screwed to the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.889 
that we fabricated and screwed to the
wall<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.930> particular<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.870> 3/4<00:00:57.870> inch

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
wall this particular one has a 3/4 inch

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.740 
wall this particular one has a 3/4 inch
square<00:00:58.590> piece<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.910> mounted<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> back

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
square piece that is mounted to the back

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
square piece that is mounted to the back
of<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> help<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.710> thing<00:01:01.949> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> stand

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
of it to help this thing kind of stand

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
of it to help this thing kind of stand
out<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.270> wall<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.140> bit<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
out from the wall with a little bit of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
out from the wall with a little bit of
space<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.640> did<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.180> wrapped

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
space and then what we did is we wrapped

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.969 
space and then what we did is we wrapped
these<00:01:07.380> LED<00:01:07.860> modules<00:01:08.369> around<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:10.530> then

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
these LED modules around and and then

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
these LED modules around and and then
hooked<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> dimmer<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> had<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.869> red

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
hooked them to a dimmer and had like red

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
hooked them to a dimmer and had like red
glowing<00:01:13.439> light<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> flashing<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
glowing light kind of flashing out and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.210 
glowing light kind of flashing out and
then<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.320> did<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.590> took<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.040> couple

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
then what we did is we took a couple

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550 
then what we did is we took a couple
pieces<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> chain<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> lagged<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.200> across

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
pieces of chain and lagged them across

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.380 
pieces of chain and lagged them across
so<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.840> flop<00:01:22.350> around<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:24.090> people

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so it would flop around and make people

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
so it would flop around and make people
think<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.560> trying<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
think that this thing was like trying to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
think that this thing was like trying to
get<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.810> something<00:01:27.810> inside<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:30.439> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
get out something inside was like it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.319 
get out something inside was like it
never<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.100> moved<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:33.180> we

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
never really moved like that because we

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.999 
never really moved like that because we
didn't<00:01:33.540> put<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> mechanism<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
didn't put a mechanism on there but that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
didn't put a mechanism on there but that
would<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.159> been<00:01:35.250> cool<00:01:35.490> maybe<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.509> should<00:01:36.720> do

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
would have been cool maybe you should do

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630 
would have been cool maybe you should do
that<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.470> cool<00:01:37.650> thing<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:37.979> people<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.490> be

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that the cool thing was people would be

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.800 
that the cool thing was people would be
looking<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> end<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> hallway

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
looking at the end of the hallway

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
looking at the end of the hallway
wondering<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> guy<00:01:41.009> whose<00:01:41.579> head<00:01:41.939> turned

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
wondering if that guy whose head turned

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
wondering if that guy whose head turned
yeah<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.840> real<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.890> weren't<00:01:44.070> even

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
yeah it was real so they weren't even

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
yeah it was real so they weren't even
looking<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> crib<00:01:45.210> paying<00:01:45.509> attention<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
looking at the crib paying attention and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
looking at the crib paying attention and
then<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.759> didn't<00:01:48.000> realize<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
then what they didn't realize is that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.679 
then what they didn't realize is that
this<00:01:48.960> motion<00:01:49.439> sensor<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:50.399> inside<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.540> wall

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
this motion sensor was inside the wall

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.870 
this motion sensor was inside the wall
panel<00:01:52.079> directly<00:01:52.560> across<00:01:52.829> from<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
panel directly across from this with a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.660 
panel directly across from this with a
little<00:01:54.090> hole<00:01:54.450> cut<00:01:54.810> out<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.829> when<00:01:56.490> they

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
little hole cut out and then when they

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
little hole cut out and then when they
walked<00:01:57.060> past<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.409> set<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> off<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.610> three

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
walked past it it set this off for three

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.530 
walked past it it set this off for three
seconds

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
seconds

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
seconds
he<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:00.960> worked<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.500> good<00:02:01.770> got<00:02:02.399> him<00:02:02.579> all

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
he was worked really good got him all

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
he was worked really good got him all
the<00:02:02.820> time<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.180> heard<00:02:03.329> screams<00:02:03.780> coming<00:02:04.200> from

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the time we heard screams coming from

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.900 
the time we heard screams coming from
the<00:02:04.770> entrance<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.369> exit<00:02:06.140> from<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.290> thing

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the entrance and exit from this thing

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.700 
the entrance and exit from this thing
so<00:02:09.910> here's<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.390> mechanism<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:11.230> basic

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
so here's the mechanism the basic

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.800 
so here's the mechanism the basic
mechanism<00:02:12.370> now<00:02:12.760> I'm<00:02:12.880> gonna<00:02:13.030> replace<00:02:13.390> this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
mechanism now I'm gonna replace this

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.199 
mechanism now I'm gonna replace this
wood<00:02:14.140> structure<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> metal<00:02:15.520> one<00:02:15.670> someday

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
wood structure with a metal one someday

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.480 
wood structure with a metal one someday
but<00:02:16.959> we<00:02:17.440> kind<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.709> whipped<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.040> thing<00:02:18.310> up

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
but we kind of whipped this thing up

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.300 
but we kind of whipped this thing up
pretty<00:02:18.730> quickly<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.740> does<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.160> it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
pretty quickly and what it does is it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.309 
pretty quickly and what it does is it
basically<00:02:21.430> goes<00:02:22.000> inside<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.540> wall<00:02:22.870> panel

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
basically goes inside a wall panel

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.620 
basically goes inside a wall panel
covered<00:02:23.980> by<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.160> fabric<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.970> no<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.240> can<00:02:25.390> see

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
covered by the fabric so no one can see

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.430 
covered by the fabric so no one can see
or<00:02:25.660> get<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.140> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
or get to it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.310 
or get to it
and<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.820> all<00:02:27.940> apart<00:02:28.240> right<00:02:28.420> now<00:02:28.660> just

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
and I have it all apart right now just

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.640 
and I have it all apart right now just
for<00:02:29.620> show-and-tell<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.690> basically<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.590> is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
for show-and-tell but basically this is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.940 
for show-and-tell but basically this is
a<00:02:32.800> pneumatic<00:02:33.370> air<00:02:33.760> chisel<00:02:34.620> air<00:02:35.620> comes<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.280> it's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
a pneumatic air chisel air comes in it's

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.699 
a pneumatic air chisel air comes in it's
put<00:02:38.950> at<00:02:39.069> about<00:02:39.250> 60<00:02:39.640> psi<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.140> turn<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.590> up

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
put at about 60 psi you can turn it up

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.820 
put at about 60 psi you can turn it up
but<00:02:42.010> it's<00:02:42.160> pretty<00:02:42.760> loud<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.360> what<00:02:44.320> happens<00:02:44.650> is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
but it's pretty loud and what happens is

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.880 
but it's pretty loud and what happens is
this<00:02:45.040> little<00:02:45.370> spring<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:45.970> here<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.630> little

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
this little spring in here this little

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.430 
this little spring in here this little
air<00:02:47.890> chisel<00:02:48.209> bounces<00:02:49.209> back<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.630> forth<00:02:49.720> off<00:02:50.200> of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
air chisel bounces back and forth off of

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.250 
air chisel bounces back and forth off of
these<00:02:51.060> hardened<00:02:52.060> steel<00:02:52.300> plates<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.870> bang

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
these hardened steel plates that bang

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.070 
these hardened steel plates that bang
against<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:53.920> metal<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.880> if<00:02:55.870> it's

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
against this metal here and if it's

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.660 
against this metal here and if it's
turned<00:02:56.320> up<00:02:56.410> too<00:02:56.620> much<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:57.040> will<00:02:57.160> actually<00:02:57.310> blow

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
turned up too much it will actually blow

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.699 
turned up too much it will actually blow
these<00:02:57.880> off<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.450> I've<00:02:58.870> used<00:02:58.900> plumber<00:02:59.350> straps

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
these off so I've used plumber straps

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.290 
these off so I've used plumber straps
and<00:02:59.890> stuff<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.610> kind<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.880> keep<00:03:01.090> it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
and stuff like that to kind of keep it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.660 
and stuff like that to kind of keep it
held<00:03:01.720> together<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.970> lids<00:03:08.400> basically<00:03:09.400> I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
held together the the lids basically I

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.780 
held together the the lids basically I
had<00:03:09.970> some<00:03:10.450> pieces<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.050> wood<00:03:11.200> there<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.459> kind<00:03:12.700> of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
had some pieces of wood there to kind of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.580 
had some pieces of wood there to kind of
hold<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.209> thing<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.630> place<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
hold this thing in place but this is the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.009 
hold this thing in place but this is the
lever<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.549> weight<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.299> actual

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
lever and the weight of the the actual

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.940 
lever and the weight of the the actual
thing<00:03:17.320> keeps<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:20.290> slide<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.829> in

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
thing keeps it on you just slide it in

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.390 
thing keeps it on you just slide it in
here<00:03:20.980> drop<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.970> into<00:03:22.090> place<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.200> then<00:03:24.010> this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
here drop it into place and then this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.940 
here drop it into place and then this
little<00:03:24.790> step<00:03:25.540> here<00:03:25.570> kind<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.350> holds<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.829> in

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
little step here kind of holds it in

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.190 
little step here kind of holds it in
place<00:03:27.100> then<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.519> put<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.120> screw<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.959> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
place then I put this on screw it and it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.289 
place then I put this on screw it and it
keeps<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.530> from<00:03:29.590> going<00:03:30.010> anywhere<00:03:30.299> even

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
keeps that from going anywhere even

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.360 
keeps that from going anywhere even
though<00:03:31.390> these<00:03:31.540> plates<00:03:32.100> aren't<00:03:33.100> kind<00:03:33.310> of

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
though these plates aren't kind of

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.550 
though these plates aren't kind of
really<00:03:33.549> fly<00:03:33.820> out<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.180> here<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.360> still<00:03:34.780> also<00:03:35.230> put

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
really fly out of here I still also put

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.560 
really fly out of here I still also put
that<00:03:35.709> little<00:03:35.890> piece<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.370> there<00:03:36.640> too<00:03:36.880> but<00:03:37.510> I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
that little piece on there too but I

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.390 
that little piece on there too but I
tried<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.840> keep<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.410> open<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.920> where<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.220> noise

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
tried to keep it open to where the noise

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.140 
tried to keep it open to where the noise
would<00:03:39.670> resonate<00:03:40.030> out<00:03:40.450> as<00:03:40.720> much<00:03:41.530> as<00:03:41.680> possible

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
