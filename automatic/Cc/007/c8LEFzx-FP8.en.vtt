 to guide us through the sea of ​​our life 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.930

 the wishes and help us understand them 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 because the wishes are not something 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.610

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.750
 stars like anchoring the wishes in the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.310
 true goods or said otherwise 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.010
 how to write a full story of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.520
 sense 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.520
 and the memory 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.830
 he is the columnist 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.130
 now 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.130
 the drama of the work 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.630
 and of the stone but can not 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010
 because there has not been a teacher 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.320
 it is the heart that gives shape to life 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.780
