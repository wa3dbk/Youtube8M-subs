00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 very good to all hello good morning 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.940
 good afternoon one asked how are you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.859
 You can remove tartar from the glass of the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
 light me nor fish tank the charlotte h with a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 fiber and nothing thanks and a question which one 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
 is your name my name is joseph and that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 reason is removed by leaving the water level 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.609
 above that area constantly and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 from time to time giving him with that fiber 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 what do you say you have in a few weeks with 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 science already disappearing altogether 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.859
 by white dot legislation to 12,000 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.449
 jupi and then the medication that I 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 recommended in the pet store 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.430
 but in addition to raising the temperature of the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100
 water and it seems that he did badly to one of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.899
 my little zebras today dawned on the corner 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.760
 from the fish tank with the head down and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 when the male pushes her a little bit 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.780
 but I see that it is difficult to maintain the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.300
 balance please what can I do not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.270
 I want them to die thank you returns the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 temperature at 26 or 27 degrees and if the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.199
 drug has malachite green 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 makes a change of 40% and returns to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.340
 dose but this time half of the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 dose but if you want total security 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 Leave that medicine and buy meters 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.850
 go to the sun in the pharmacy dosing 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 ratio of one tablet every 25 liters 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.480
 during a week with changes of 25% 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.610
 of the water 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.230
 two days before each dose at 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 finish the treatment we will make a 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.330
 40% change and we will put active carbon 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 at the rate of one small spoon every 20 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 liters for three days all this you 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.510
 help much luck has 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 avenged I dare to ask you 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.330
 commented that the filter is cleaned every 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.560
 two months I have an actuator in a 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 80 liters aquarium that is underway 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.570
 two months ago the cycled but still 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.570
 it has its ups and downs 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.590
 clean a new filter twice in two 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.540
 months is too much cleaning actually 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.490
 Filter cleaning depends on each 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 aquarium if you have many fish for the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 size of your aquarium would have to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 clean it about once a month 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.050
 but if you have few fish or normal 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.390
 his thing would be to clean it more or less every 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.100
 two months that so much dirt comes out is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.110
 normal mostly of the sponge and the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.120
 hair this last one you can change it 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.250
 every now and then or clean it under the tap 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.040
 if it is very dirty but the other charges 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.470
 always with aquarium water greetings 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.990
 like to plant in my 200-year-old aquarium 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.119
 with some goldwyn and Moors that plants me 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.880
 you recommend the mixture between golden and 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.980
 telescopes is discouraged by what 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.530
 delicate that are your 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.390
 so keep an eye on these fish 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.010
 can only recommend some plants 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.989
 that are very hard because if you do not 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.580
 eat and how I usually say varieties 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.730
 of beans are very good for these 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.730
 cases 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 to feed apples snails and almost 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.670
 any snail like most 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.470
 times in addition to commercial meals of 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.000
 the greatest variety you find is well 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.780
 of good the fruit for example melon 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.250
 banana 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.680
 the vegetable like zucchini cucumber 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.410
 the potato and seafood and fish like 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.180
 clam squid hake you can always 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.180
 improvise good this has been everything and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.160
 I hope to see you here tomorrow Chao 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.350
 here I leave to you peaks I take zampÃ¡ndose 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.250
 a piece of melon is very buds and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.250
 he does not want the potato 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.780
 thanks for watching my videos 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.860
