card format issues so i've been looking

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.040 
card format issues so i've been looking
for<00:00:42.750> another<00:00:43.110> digital<00:00:43.620> camera<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.930> did<00:00:45.930> at

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
for another digital camera that did at

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.860 
for another digital camera that did at
least<00:00:46.379> 10<00:00:46.950> times<00:00:47.219> optical<00:00:47.430> zoom<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
least 10 times optical zoom and as you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.860 
least 10 times optical zoom and as you
can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.680> does<00:00:49.920> 30<00:00:50.550> optical<00:00:51.270> zoom<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
can see this one does 30 optical zoom I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.720 
can see this one does 30 optical zoom I
compared<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.070> few<00:00:53.430> other<00:00:54.680> brands

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
compared it to a few other brands

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.189 
compared it to a few other brands
specifically<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.510> lumix<00:00:58.260> tzd<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.750> TZ<00:01:01.140> 2

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
specifically the lumix tzd and the TZ 2

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.520 
specifically the lumix tzd and the TZ 2
55<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.510> they<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.019> price<00:01:04.110> range

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
55 and they bit out of my price range

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.969 
55 and they bit out of my price range
and<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.170> cannon<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and so I see it on this cannon got it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.120 
and so I see it on this cannon got it
for<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> really<00:01:08.580> good<00:01:08.700> price<00:01:08.880> uh-huh<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.130> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
for a really good price uh-huh and so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.600 
for a really good price uh-huh and so
let's<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> quick<00:01:11.909> tour<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.720> box<00:01:13.610> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
let's have a quick tour of the box it

it looks like fraction a bit bigger than

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.800 
it looks like fraction a bit bigger than
my<00:02:40.480> current<00:02:40.780> one<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:42.280> I'll<00:02:42.970> keep<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
my current one now I'll keep the the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.690 
my current one now I'll keep the the
screen<00:02:44.170> pointer<00:02:44.620> down<00:02:44.860> otherwise<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.520> get<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
screen pointer down otherwise you get a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.590 
screen pointer down otherwise you get a
massive<00:02:46.360> reflection<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.110> me<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.910> that's<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.330> on

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
massive reflection of me so that's it on

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.190 
massive reflection of me so that's it on
the<00:02:49.750> back<00:02:49.980> my<00:02:50.980> only<00:02:51.130> concern<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:52.030> where<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:52.990> put

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
the back my only concern is where I put

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.840 
the back my only concern is where I put
my<00:02:53.260> thumb<00:02:53.710> when<00:02:54.040> I'm<00:02:54.160> trying<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.460> take<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.670> photo
