next<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> another<00:00:50.820> tumbleweed<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.719> offense<00:00:52.079> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
next to another tumbleweed on offense I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.420 
next to another tumbleweed on offense I
think<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.730> me<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.170> problematic<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.430> not

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
think for me it was problematic that not

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
think for me it was problematic that not
all<00:00:56.550> tumbleweeds<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.270> interesting<00:00:58.020> looking

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
all tumbleweeds are interesting looking

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.250

so we should have kept a log of how many

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.940 
so we should have kept a log of how many
miles<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.149> put<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.810> maybe<00:01:34.380> Hertz<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
miles we put in on this maybe Hertz can

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.060 
miles we put in on this maybe Hertz can
tell<00:01:35.130> us<00:01:35.899> but<00:01:36.899> there<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> lot<00:01:37.649> of<00:01:37.799> tense
