00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.220
 to make a buffer so just 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 take two pieces of cardboard and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.429
 draw a first circle and another to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.390
 inside we will cut so we 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.279
 will superimpose each other 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.470
 is celebrating prepared small balls 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.810
 and we are going to come and surround the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 cartons until the hole is there 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.809
 fills and simply roll around 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.469
 and fill the hole so initially at the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.180
 little column go back to the end there 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.050
 you will certainly need their input 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.050
 with a needle 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.910
 so when lana filled both 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.150
 circles of cartons we will come apart 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.140
 like these the wool is past the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:07.390
 chisel between the two circles of cartons 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.010
 and we will cut all around so in 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.340
 now fine if it's a little bit 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.690
 hard 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.690
 you take a cutter 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.420
 when the whole round is cut noah lou 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:33.320
 come place a wire between the two 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:36.640
 circles of cartons and we're going to 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.640
 is strongly this thread 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 6 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.939
 it must be tight now 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.939
 can remove our auxerre 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.440
 here is what you need to get so he 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.440
 only left to scissors 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.360
 So even once there are more than 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.380
 put it where you want so well 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.380
 often it's on the hats
