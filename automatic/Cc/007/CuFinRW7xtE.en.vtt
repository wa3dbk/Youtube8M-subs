whatever but I'd never seen anything
like<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.650> as<00:02:16.880> great<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.060> da<00:02:18.239> moreira<00:02:18.600> was

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
like this and as great as da moreira was

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
like this and as great as da moreira was
possibly<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> more<00:02:20.190> impressive<00:02:20.400> thing<00:02:20.880> was

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
possibly the more impressive thing was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.580 
possibly the more impressive thing was
actually<00:02:21.330> Mike<00:02:21.750> will<00:02:21.989> mark<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.440> out

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
actually Mike will mark on out

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.490 
actually Mike will mark on out
afterwards<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> doing<00:02:24.269> nearly<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.750> well<00:02:24.959> it

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
afterwards and doing nearly as well it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
afterwards and doing nearly as well it
was<00:02:25.650> possibly<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.130> greater<00:02:26.370> achievement<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> do

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
was possibly a greater achievement to do

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.449 
was possibly a greater achievement to do
near<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.840> know<00:02:27.930> what<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.109> mean<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.310> was

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
near if you know what I mean and it was

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.280 
near if you know what I mean and it was
