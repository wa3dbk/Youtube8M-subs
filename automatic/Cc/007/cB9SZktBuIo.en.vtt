chief engineer on the ls3 project and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.250 
chief engineer on the ls3 project and
what<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.240> basically<00:02:27.540> looking<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
what you're basically looking at is a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.070 
what you're basically looking at is a
robotic<00:02:28.890> pack<00:02:29.070> you'll<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.450> real<00:02:30.630> goal<00:02:30.660> for

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
robotic pack you'll so the real goal for

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.960 
robotic pack you'll so the real goal for
this<00:02:31.230> machine<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.490> go<00:02:32.610> where<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
this machine is to go where the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.060 
this machine is to go where the
dismantle<00:02:33.480> warfighter<00:02:33.810> goes<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.890> help

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
dismantle warfighter goes and to help

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.160 
dismantle warfighter goes and to help
carry<00:02:35.310> their<00:02:35.460> load<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.120> how<00:02:36.480> does<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.750> stand<00:02:36.960> up

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
carry their load so how does it stand up

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.230 
carry their load so how does it stand up
to<00:02:37.320> like<00:02:37.560> mountains<00:02:38.040> rivers<00:02:38.460> different

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
to like mountains rivers different

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.820 
to like mountains rivers different
terrain<00:02:39.510> yeah<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.230> great<00:02:40.320> question<00:02:40.740> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
terrain yeah that's a great question and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.470 
terrain yeah that's a great question and
this<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.490> why<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.060> developed<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
this is really why we developed this

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
this is really why we developed this
machine<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.320> would<00:02:43.410> be

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
machine is so that it would be

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.300 
machine is so that it would be
all-terrain

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
all-terrain

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
all-terrain
so<00:02:44.640> we've<00:02:44.850> tested<00:02:45.090> stream<00:02:45.630> crossings<00:02:46.110> we've

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
so we've tested stream crossings we've

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.560 
so we've tested stream crossings we've
gone<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> mountains<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:48.090> Twentynine

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
gone to the mountains in Twentynine

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.870 
gone to the mountains in Twentynine
Palms<00:02:48.870> California<00:02:49.220> we've<00:02:50.220> tested<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.610> lot<00:02:50.760> of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
Palms California we've tested a lot of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400 
Palms California we've tested a lot of
East<00:02:51.060> Coast<00:02:51.270> woods<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.960> mountains<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.380> we

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
East Coast woods and mountains so we

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.600 
East Coast woods and mountains so we
really<00:02:52.770> are<00:02:52.890> trying<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.310> go<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.580> many

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
really are trying to go to as many

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.000 
really are trying to go to as many
different<00:02:54.060> terrains<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.770> push

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
different terrains as we can and push

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.530 
different terrains as we can and push
the<00:02:56.160> mobility<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> autonomy<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.270> machine

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the mobility in the autonomy the machine

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.420 
the mobility in the autonomy the machine
so<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.930> keep<00:02:58.050> up<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.470> warfighter<00:02:58.830> so

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so it can keep up with the warfighter so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.070 
so it can keep up with the warfighter so
I'm<00:02:59.760> really<00:03:00.060> excited<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:00.600> see<00:03:00.990> this

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
I'm really excited to actually see this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.590 
I'm really excited to actually see this
thing<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.380> action<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.070> can<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.910> gear<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.480> and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
thing in action so can you gear up and

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.060 
thing in action so can you gear up and
give<00:03:03.810> me<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.930> demo<00:03:04.110> yeah<00:03:04.440> let's<00:03:04.710> take<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.920> for<00:03:05.040> a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
give me a demo yeah let's take it for a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:20.149 
give me a demo yeah let's take it for a
walk<00:03:05.250> all<00:03:05.430> right<00:03:05.520> great<00:03:05.670> let's<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.800 

so<00:03:21.159> what<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.849> tell<00:03:22.060> me<00:03:22.180> about<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
so what can you tell me about the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.179 
so what can you tell me about the
different<00:03:23.110> functions<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.739> modes

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
different functions and modes

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.759 
different functions and modes
this<00:03:24.909> machine<00:03:25.209> has<00:03:25.360> well<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.379> good<00:03:26.500> time<00:03:26.650> to

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
this machine has well it's good time to

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.530 
this machine has well it's good time to
ask<00:03:26.920> cuz<00:03:27.189> we're<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.459> one<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.879> them<00:03:27.970> right<00:03:28.120> now

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
ask cuz we're in one of them right now

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
ask cuz we're in one of them right now
so<00:03:28.659> this<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> leader<00:03:29.620> follow<00:03:29.920> mode<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.670> this

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
so this is a leader follow mode and this

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.130 
so this is a leader follow mode and this
is<00:03:30.909> kind<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.269> bread<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.569> butter<00:03:31.689> for<00:03:31.989> how

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
is kind of the bread and butter for how

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.979 
is kind of the bread and butter for how
ls3<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.799> really<00:03:33.099> going<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:33.700> operate<00:03:33.939> the<00:03:34.720> idea

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
ls3 is really going to operate the idea

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.539 
ls3 is really going to operate the idea
is<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.500> know<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.650> can<00:03:35.859> see<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:36.189> not

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
is that you know you can see I'm not

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.069 
is that you know you can see I'm not
really<00:03:36.790> distracted<00:03:37.269> by<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.420> robot<00:03:37.810> right<00:03:37.959> now

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
really distracted by the robot right now

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.720 
really distracted by the robot right now
we're<00:03:38.290> able<00:03:38.379> to<00:03:38.500> have<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> conversation<00:03:38.890> or<00:03:39.519> I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
we're able to have a conversation or I

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.640 
we're able to have a conversation or I
could<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.150> doing<00:03:40.329> something<00:03:40.659> else<00:03:40.750> but

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
could be doing something else but

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.979 
could be doing something else but
effectively<00:03:42.159> the<00:03:42.849> robots<00:03:43.180> following<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
effectively the robots following the

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.500 
effectively the robots following the
stripes<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.379> my<00:03:44.470> backpack<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.819> using<00:03:46.209> me<00:03:46.329> as<00:03:46.389> a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
stripes on my backpack and using me as a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.509 
stripes on my backpack and using me as a
guide<00:03:46.690> for<00:03:46.720> working<00:03:47.650> through<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.889> terrain<00:03:48.069> if

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
guide for working through the terrain if

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.009 
guide for working through the terrain if
you<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:48.849> in<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.090> tight<00:03:49.299> pinch<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:49.870> also

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
you get in a tight pinch you can also

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.660 
you get in a tight pinch you can also
directly<00:03:50.560> control<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.250> joystick

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
directly control it with the joystick

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.970 
directly control it with the joystick
and<00:03:52.569> and<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.019> we<00:03:53.109> have<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> fully<00:03:53.650> autonomous

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
and and then we have a fully autonomous

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.860 
and and then we have a fully autonomous
mode<00:03:54.400> which<00:03:54.609> is<00:03:54.730> go<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:54.940> Waypoint<00:03:55.389> so<00:03:55.569> you<00:03:55.659> can

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
mode which is go to Waypoint so you can

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.899 
mode which is go to Waypoint so you can
tell<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.109> robot<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:57.069> know<00:03:57.159> go<00:03:57.370> 100<00:03:57.700> meters

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
tell the robot you know go 100 meters

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.369 
tell the robot you know go 100 meters
that<00:03:58.060> way<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.629> robot<00:03:58.930> without<00:03:59.019> any

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
that way and the robot without any

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.860 
that way and the robot without any
driver<00:03:59.709> or<00:04:00.040> leader<00:04:00.250> will<00:04:01.000> autonomously<00:04:01.599> work

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
driver or leader will autonomously work

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.050 
driver or leader will autonomously work
its<00:04:02.019> way<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.439> goal<00:04:02.470> point<00:04:02.829> so<00:04:03.430> how<00:04:03.909> could

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
its way to that goal point so how could

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.420 
its way to that goal point so how could
this<00:04:04.180> be<00:04:04.389> effective<00:04:05.170> for<00:04:05.889> Marines

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
this be effective for Marines

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.729 
this be effective for Marines
well<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.480> main<00:04:07.629> idea<00:04:07.959> for<00:04:08.019> Marines<00:04:08.379> right<00:04:08.560> now

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
well the main idea for Marines right now

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.640 
well the main idea for Marines right now
is<00:04:09.040> as<00:04:09.340> an<00:04:09.489> offloading<00:04:09.879> capability<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.349> you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
is as an offloading capability so you

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.410 
is as an offloading capability so you
know<00:04:11.980> dismounted<00:04:12.519> Marines<00:04:12.760> typically<00:04:13.209> carry

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
know dismounted Marines typically carry

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.929 
know dismounted Marines typically carry
around<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.810> hundred<00:04:13.900> pounds<00:04:14.439> of<00:04:14.519> gear<00:04:15.519> between

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
around a hundred pounds of gear between

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.050 
around a hundred pounds of gear between
body<00:04:16.150> armor<00:04:16.539> backpack<00:04:17.049> food<00:04:17.440> water<00:04:17.829> ammo<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
body armor backpack food water ammo and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.150 
body armor backpack food water ammo and
the<00:04:19.120> idea<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:20.019> for<00:04:20.199> us<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.410> get<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.680> off<00:04:20.949> the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
the idea is for us to get that off the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.100 
the idea is for us to get that off the
warfighter<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.789> really<00:04:22.270> improve<00:04:22.960> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
warfighter and really improve the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.050 
warfighter and really improve the
warfighters<00:04:23.500> mobility<00:04:23.979> reduce<00:04:24.430> injury<00:04:24.789> rates

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
warfighters mobility reduce injury rates

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.939 
warfighters mobility reduce injury rates
and<00:04:25.780> generally<00:04:26.260> improve<00:04:26.590> their<00:04:26.770> at<00:04:26.860> their

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
and generally improve their at their

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.700 
and generally improve their at their
capabilities<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.419> know<00:04:28.750> ideally<00:04:29.349> you

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
capabilities so you know ideally you

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.839 
capabilities so you know ideally you
could<00:04:29.860> take<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.039> lot<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.430> equipment<00:04:30.580> that

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
could take a lot of the equipment that

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.430 
could take a lot of the equipment that
warfighter<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.449> carried<00:04:31.780> through<00:04:31.990> through

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
warfighter is carried through through

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.649 
warfighter is carried through through
long<00:04:32.590> foot<00:04:32.860> patrols<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.970> put<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.479> the

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
long foot patrols and put it on the

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.060 
long foot patrols and put it on the
robot<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.349> it<00:04:35.470> carry<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.770> gear<00:04:35.919> for

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
robot and have it carry the gear for

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.640 
robot and have it carry the gear for
them

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.710
