00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.230
 I belong to the small group 3% of the world critics although I do not 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.509
 finished of marveling harry potter the relics of death part 2 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.560
 that is to say at least 97% of the mythical north america gave it a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.520
 qualification 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.880
 most undoubtedly this is the best of the eight parts without a doubt the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.250
 behind closed with much impetus with much creativity and strength 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.930
 but from there to the qualification that cinema classics like the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.629
 godfather or white house I think it's a little exaggeration 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.339
 definitely 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.029
 harry potter has made an amazing box office phenomenon we only eat like 

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:43.180
 account 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.400
 what on its first day of screening and the united states has collected 43 million 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.600
 of dollars is to say that he has done in 24 hours what other productions can 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.370
 to do vilna at the weekend 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.440
 in the united states the summer season 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.620
 for example 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.690
 in terms of doctors no doubt that gloomy apocalyptic environment works 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.580
 of what does not work for example of this the combat scenes 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.940
 while the un 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.050
 very timid and grossly digital something I have inspired by the lord of the rings 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.630
 in terms of convalescence they find film a kind of western 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.760
 currently by guns 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.100
 but the problem is that he is also in charge of the last three or 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 four parts 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
 It is not that a fort to show me that hostile environment 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030
 Between good and bad 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.100
 in this type of production 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.540
 in the end harry potter closes a cycle without having achieved a masterpiece 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.700
 but no doubt perhaps the audience 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.230
 achieve the movie possibly my level 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.180
 Millions of dollars in ticketing requires the Academy of Sciences and Arts 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.090
 cinematic of colihue 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.630
 include it as one of the ten best films of the year 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.180
 thing I repeat 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.780
 no p 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.100
 no doubt entertain 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.570
 undoubtedly of what incredible moment undoubtedly there are spectacular constants but 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.580
 on the whole 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.700
 Harry Potter 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.909
 religion death 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.070
 part 2 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.639
 this overload 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.609
 a franchise that has made more than 6 billion dollars 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.139
 what you want to do martÃ­nez 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.149
 have money 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.379
 something positive 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.089
 but without a doubt 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:28.629
 there was no justification for an eighth part harry potter 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.839
 what was counted in this eighth part bimbo have joined 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.079
 the seventh installment 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.299
 the excuse is that the book is very extensive there was much to tell 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.719
 and here I am speculating 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.730
 no doubt what the producers wanted to obtain 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.230
 ic last guess 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.230
 of this great lie of golden wolves that was even 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.009
 because we have managed to obtain 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
 a smaller amount 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.209
 regarding the closing 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.109
 'now who' 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 consider that it is 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.509
 but you have to remember 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.239
 what they were looking for a man that after 7 6 to storm before 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 where apparently evil and barcelona 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.709
 the cavalcade 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.709
 in the hour of the crisis 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.479
 you have to accept it 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.099
