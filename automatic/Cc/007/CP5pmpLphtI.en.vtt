00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.110
 that's the sound of the 2014 music fair 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.790
 here with us in the video studio of the man 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.700
 who delivered the sound of the sÃ¶ren 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.380
 I want to greet you also halo and it 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.110
 Of course there is an amplifier of that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.730
 whole here again brings out this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.059
 sound it's a marshall amp you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.920
 while he has a very special 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.380
 Quali's collection is just that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 the series custom tattoo that is one 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.140
 cooperation with different tattoo 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.320
 artists practically on the models 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.970
 the jvm series practically their own 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.879
 layout your own design your own 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.620
 to raise art so to speak so there is 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.839
 different designs of the different ones 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.440
 tattoo artist you then also the 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.810
 different models of the jvm series 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.010
 so that's exactly what it is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.540
 nice gimmick but at one 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.860
 amplifier of course plays the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.810
 sound a role 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 what are there so the core elements in the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.470
 He is a model in this model 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 probably the lesser known of the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 Models is a core element that is a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.680
 very quietly amplifies 1 1 watt 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.540
 reinforce the man again my 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 So you can throttle performance 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.649
 practically at low room volume 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.570
 Turn up the amplifier and turn it on 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.040
 each of the virtually complete tubes ems 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 knows that in certain 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.320
 working point need to be great too 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.340
 sound 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200
 and that was here in principle now 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 actually the clean not just channel 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.979
 used and we could at the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.750
 volume without problems entertained and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.729
 he i have the sweet spot so to speak 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.110
 reached that has the amplifier 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.750
 nice of the saturation and if I am so 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.290
 he often plays games then he is clean and if 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.270
 I have stronger rhine then 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.920
 judge and spread a bit 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.120
 Do you see this vintage art? 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.400
 to handle amplifiers 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.560
 where do you see the perfect ones 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.210
 deployment options so before 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.730
 Of course it is the special thing 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.000
 design, of course, so of course 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.380
 amplifier great but the design is that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.790
 It's convenient that we're here now 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.710
 especially want to feature because it is one 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.210
 It is, so to speak, a limited edition 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.580
 goes to the end of this year 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.490
 and you can practically see the designs of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.360
 Five tattoo artist on the models 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.440
 order or buy, so to speak 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.580
 the best that you wish the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.350
 dealers are in stock 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.940
 and of course, that's what it is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.360
 if I say something to the amp myself 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.340
 should 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.360
 the scope of that would be me 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.940
 now in first line as very luxurious 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.760
 lamb or as a recording look like 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.700
 if you practically all roar at home 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.860
 wanted to record songs and sensitive 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.410
 neighbors then it would be with a 100 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.060
 watt if he has difficulty 20 watts 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.709
 top one can already see the night magazine 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.530
 but terrorize with these people 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.880
 this performance reduction is too 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.220
 absolutely stress-free 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.080
 There is a dog louder when he snores 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.580
 or so we have none here 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 have sensitive neighbors because of that 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.970
 Now to ausklang again a 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.040
 sound thank you so much beautiful 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.630
 musikmesse everything would be good too 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.930
 Thank you for being here 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.930
 Thank you
