 today in culinary zucchini cream 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.369
 hello how about to make this recipe 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.770
 we will need these ingredients 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.510
 zucchini 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.710
 potato onion or ground onion 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.710
 olive oil 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.970
 butter and a couple of successes 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.500
 Salt 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 black pepper and chicken broth 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.620
 let's cook we start with the onion 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.800
 in this case onion earth we cut it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.290
 and we peel it and chop it not very thin 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.730
 this is going to go next pressure is going to 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.680
 know immediately with which the pieces 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.430
 they can be great, you do not have to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430
 make a Julian 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.089
 We melted the butter in a spray 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.380
 of oil and put the onion to sauté 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.050
 we support it a little and meanwhile 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.120
 we peel the potato 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.210
 as in the case of the onion once 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.290
 We peeled potatoes chop is not 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 bucket that are small pieces 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.420
 we add to the onion 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.070
 we take a few turns so it does not stick 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.070
 from time to time 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 and we take this moment to 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.330
 salt and pepper is something that is going to taste 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.580
 I recommend you stay short because 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.200
 as in the end it is going to rectify better 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 do not get to go that I would not have 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.590
 remedy 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 after the salt we put the pepper 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.049
 always better if it is freshly ground 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.729
 and we take a few turns so that we do not know 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.729
 stick 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.390
 we let go and peel the zucchini 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.130
 I just took half the cream off 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.520
 it is thinner but retains the color 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.790
 green skin 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.630
 We cut the tips and chop them as the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.370
 onion and potato 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.959
 with a rather thick cut 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.909
 although it looks like a dish more than 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.940
 autumn-winter is now season 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.099
 Zucchini can also take the cold or 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.610
 warm and keep the recipe for when 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.610
 make it colder 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.110
 once all the sliced ​​zucchini 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.940
 we clean the table always between 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.560
 ingredients and ingredients leave it well 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.560
 clean and add to the cream 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.379
 we go around 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.010
 and once fired after a couple of 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.840
 minutes we add chicken broth 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.510
 It could also be done with water but that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.049
 it is more pleasant 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.269
 we raise the fire medium-high fire and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.689
 When it starts to boil , we can 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.689
 cover 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.470
 taking a few turns as always so that 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.760
 do not take off 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.760
 and wait for it to boil 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.540
 here you have it, it's time to cover the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.849
 pot and bake attention I'm going to leave 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.590
 good this plane I put it so that 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.480
 you see the safety valve that is the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.569
 yellow dot that you have in the center 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.219
 it's down here I just went up and it's 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.640
 because the temperature inside the 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:49.250
 pot is already the cooking from that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.780
 moment against 10 minutes and past the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.459
 10 minutes and the other on the cidaut disk 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.459
 just add the quesitos 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.990
 and crush with the mini filming 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.550
 you will not need to strain or go through 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.460
 the Chinese the cream because it is already 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.500
 pretty fine the potato the onion and the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.010
 zucchini almost do not leave fibers with what 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.980
 which is not necessary 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.280
 simply give maximum power and already 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.410
 you will have a list 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.079
 before giving the plate by finishing what 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.900
 rectify we have tried with a spoon 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.639
 and if you need pepper or salt you can 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.940
 put a little in my case lacks a 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.970
 little salt to add and ready some 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.330
 more turns so that the whole mixed and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.410
 here you have it zucchini cream 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.700
 decorated with a little oil and 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.190
 pretty pepper like I like 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.720
 I hope you do it is a dish that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.030
 can take all year but now 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.380
 prescribed or lukewarm is also very good 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.380
 and take advantage of culinary
