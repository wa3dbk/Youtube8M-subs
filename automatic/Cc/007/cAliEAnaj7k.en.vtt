grass idea get them an overhead heat

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
grass idea get them an overhead heat
stores<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.679> put<00:01:55.679> them<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:57.229> over<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

otherwise I'd probably like maybe keep

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.500 
otherwise I'd probably like maybe keep
them<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:07.500> playa<00:02:07.830> right<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:08.970> okay<00:02:09.780> but
