00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
ahead and got at 50 and then 52

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
ahead and got at 50 and then 52
construction<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.850> way<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.180> boost

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
construction and that way I could boost

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.260 
construction and that way I could boost
up<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> level<00:00:55.230> 57<00:00:55.829> Eagle<00:00:56.370> lectern<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.119 
up to the level 57 Eagle lectern that
way<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> could<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.870> camelon<00:00:58.410> already<00:00:58.829> tabs

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
way I could make camelon already tabs
and<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.760> 60<00:01:00.210> magic-making<00:01:00.750> tabs<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
and then I got 60 magic-making tabs and
then<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> decided<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
then I decided to do a little bit of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
then I decided to do a little bit of
Slayer<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> went<00:01:04.799> ahead<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.189> 35<00:01:05.760> Slayer

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
Slayer so I went ahead and got 35 Slayer

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
Slayer so I went ahead and got 35 Slayer
and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.229> 60<00:01:07.740> attack<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and then I actually got 60 attack and I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.740 
and then I actually got 60 attack and I
felt<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.880> idiot<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.360> missing<00:01:09.659> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
recording but there it is and then I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
recording but there it is and then I
went<00:01:12.210> ahead<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.450> bought<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.840> d<00:01:12.900> skinny<00:01:13.290> from

went ahead and bought my d skinny from
Ava<00:01:13.710> toll<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:14.610> absolutely<00:01:15.180> awesome

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
Ava toll and that was absolutely awesome

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
Ava toll and that was absolutely awesome
after<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> went<00:01:16.680> ahead<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.100> 40

after that I went ahead and got 40
Slayer<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> did<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> quest

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Slayer and then I did the quest

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
Slayer and then I did the quest
Gertrude's<00:01:19.470> cat<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.490> some

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
Gertrude's cat just for you know some

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.940 
Gertrude's cat just for you know some
odd<00:01:20.970> reason<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.479> saw<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> video<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.380> chrisarchie

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
odd reason I saw a video on chrisarchie

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
odd reason I saw a video on chrisarchie
of<00:01:23.070> somebody<00:01:23.430> selling<00:01:23.759> cats<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.360> death<00:01:24.509> runes

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
of somebody selling cats for death runes

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.060 
of somebody selling cats for death runes
and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.200> figured<00:01:25.470> that'd<00:01:25.590> actually<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and I figured that'd actually be a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039 
and I figured that'd actually be a
pretty<00:01:26.130> good<00:01:26.340> idea<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.570> after<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
pretty good idea and then after that I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.080 
pretty good idea and then after that I
did<00:01:28.320> some<00:01:28.439> more<00:01:28.530> Slayer<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> actually<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.490> 55

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
did some more Slayer and actually got 55

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
did some more Slayer and actually got 55
strength<00:01:30.630> getting<00:01:31.079> 60<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.500> hack<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.100> helps

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
strength getting 60 is hack really helps

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
strength getting 60 is hack really helps
me<00:01:32.369> slingshot<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.060> strength<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.380> I

as that grant some agility XP and it got

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.940 
as that grant some agility XP and it got
me<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> 35<00:02:06.390> which<00:02:06.990> gives<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> requirement

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

things that i missed

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.080 
things that i missed
the<00:02:13.980> recording<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.610> would<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.879> talk

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the recording that I would like to talk

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420 
the recording that I would like to talk
about<00:02:15.270> actually<00:02:16.230> did<00:02:16.410> quite<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.709> bit<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.890> peking

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
about actually did quite a bit of peking

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.449 
about actually did quite a bit of peking
and<00:02:17.849> my<00:02:18.120> stats<00:02:18.450> are<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.590> meant<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.099> PK

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
and my stats are really not meant for PK

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.309 
and my stats are really not meant for PK
so<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> did<00:02:21.300> end<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.569> losing<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:21.989> three<00:02:22.260> or

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
so I did end up losing about three or

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
so I did end up losing about three or
four<00:02:22.410> hundred<00:02:22.620> K<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.099> day<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.090> was

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
four hundred K that day but it was

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.910 
four hundred K that day but it was
definitely<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.660> lot<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.170> fun<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.560> worth<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
definitely a lot of fun and worth the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.070 
definitely a lot of fun and worth the
money<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> decided<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.569> go<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.840> some

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
money and then I decided to go do some
barrows<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:29.430> still<00:02:29.970> don't<00:02:30.300> really

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
barrows and I still don't really

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.449 
barrows and I still don't really
understand<00:02:30.989> how<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.440> thing<00:02:31.709> happened<00:02:32.190> but

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
understand how this thing happened but

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.580 
understand how this thing happened but
it<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.790> what<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.900> fighting<00:02:34.110> Derek
