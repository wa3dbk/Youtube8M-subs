00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.640
 it continues with a very 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.830
 interesting question 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.690
 made by christoph freunschlag 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.370
 why does rapid always sell players 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 and an international starting place 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 reach balance to balance 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 Is not it easier to tidy yourself? 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.949
 economize 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.070
 this risk that comes with it quickly 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.410
 We are always sold only as positive 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 but harms the club in his 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.500
 look and maybe you hang here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 the same question 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.969
 what does it look like now? 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.969
 economic situation in the moment 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.850
 I have been president for eleven years 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.460
 wonderful club and from the beginning 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.500
 faced with the situation that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 time of budget does not make it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 was clear 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.129
 in which way we too 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 take care of the revenue side 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.160
 we are against all those years 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.869
 definitions 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.250
 Save that or any other 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.710
 personage represented a 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.939
 risk and so the entire presidency in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 the amount of two to three million 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:21.119
 gone because we are out of the running 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.119
 revenue structure the expenditure structure 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.729
 which one is relatively accurate already at the beginning 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.869
 of an economic year 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.820
 others could not cover 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.100
 possibility of course also given as 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 those of additional income 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 For example, on the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.610
 to save on the expenditure side but if you 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.930
 assumes that about 70 percent 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 our budget the player operated the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.280
 game operation then affects a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.920
 reduction of the budget by ten or twelve 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.390
 or 15 percent of course 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.250
 seriously on the player's budget 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.270
 impact and I do not know 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.479
 whether that would be in the sense of the fans for that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.400
 would mean that some players 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 can not commit that the cadre 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.470
 weakens and I believe that that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.420
 The goal is not the fans 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.090
 but we ask for it is above all 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.150
 not my goal for me either 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.090
 as I said for some time 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.740
 President of the club but I am too 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.780
 a fan of the club and i want to 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.330
 as well as each of which tribune 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.390
 Now we always sit in front 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.860
 that we play football in the eastern 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.610
 maybe also in the European one 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.000
 role-play 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.890
 and that's just the savings pin on 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.250
 the expenditure side very difficult 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.860
 therefore it was always our goal 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.200
 that gap here in the normal 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.720
 not to bring an economic area 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.989
 is due to additional revenue 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.560
 they that are taking part in a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.070
 european competition active transfer 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.260
 It is in the 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.980
 Actual years, too 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.690
 successful 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.160
 We always had difficulties 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.030
 then in those years when we do not have one 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 europacup because we are one after all 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.610
 very important source of income anymore 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.290
 could close 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.260
 And that's the situation that is 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.040
 therefore has updated it's so 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.750
 important a constant extra 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.760
 source of income 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.880
 this constant additional 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.280
 source of income would be a new stadium in 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.600
 the simply the added value in this 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.120
 would be the largest dimension 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.680
 then you can dispose of one differently 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.989
 second consideration and you will be in it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.530
 The next days are completely different 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.640
 simply not asking for it 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.220
 It is a performance-related television contract 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.490
 for me as president of the biggest 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.370
 sports club in Austria unbearable 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:15.260
 in spite of all the solidarity one faces 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.080
 should muster the small unite 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.330
 continue to note that in 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.830
 substantially all clubs same 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.310
 get TV money and we will 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.660
 therefore try with all consistency 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.060
 to change this 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.050
 although that is not easy because im 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.060
 essentially all others are against it 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.960
 we are today in a democratic state 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.700
 Life 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.460
 but we try by exhaustion 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.650
 all appeal this to at least 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.200
 partly to change and thus the 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.950
 running once position of sk rapid too 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.380
 improve 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.380
 I've been here for a short time 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.780
 that's what it was last year 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.230
 no international proven no great 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.350
 transfer there again the hole or 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.030
 what will it look like financially? 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.820
 the economic or we have that 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.210
 Year 11 12 with a loss 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.310
 completed because we partially through 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.870
 our economic work 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.650
 could cover previous years 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.460
 not entirely this year 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.620
 yourself with a slight surplus 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.090
 So develop everything in everything is one 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.170
 year without europacup for us a whole 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.170
 big problem
