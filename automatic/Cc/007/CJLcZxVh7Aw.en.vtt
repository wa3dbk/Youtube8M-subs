gorgeous

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.729 

okay<00:00:49.550> Evan<00:00:50.110> getting<00:00:51.110> questions<00:00:51.530> about

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
okay Evan getting questions about

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.610 
okay Evan getting questions about
juicing<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.489> smoothies<00:00:53.230> there's<00:00:54.230> some<00:00:54.410> raw

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
juicing and smoothies there's some raw

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.299 
juicing and smoothies there's some raw
gurus<00:00:55.340> out<00:00:55.700> there<00:00:56.420> saying<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:57.309> smoothies

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
gurus out there saying that smoothies

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.880 
gurus out there saying that smoothies
are<00:00:58.430> bad<00:00:58.550> because<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:59.000> oxidize<00:00:59.590> this<00:01:00.590> with

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
are bad because you oxidize this with

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.729 
are bad because you oxidize this with
you<00:01:00.980> because<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.400> blade<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:03.170> air<00:01:03.350> getting

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
you because of the blade the air getting

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.030 
you because of the blade the air getting
sucked<00:01:04.010> in<00:01:04.159> politics<00:01:05.410> so<00:01:06.410> therefore<00:01:06.590> usage<00:01:06.950> of

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
sucked in politics so therefore usage of

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.100 
sucked in politics so therefore usage of
juices<00:01:07.869> well<00:01:09.220> is<00:01:10.220> your<00:01:10.280> pudding<00:01:10.780> like<00:01:11.780> peanut

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
juices well is your pudding like peanut

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
juices well is your pudding like peanut
butter<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:13.310> banana<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.509> some<00:01:14.720> yogurt<00:01:15.130> and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
butter and a banana and some yogurt and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.980 
butter and a banana and some yogurt and
your<00:01:16.310> smoothie<00:01:16.729> yeah<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.330> going<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.540> oxidize

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
your smoothie yeah it's going to oxidize

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.279 
your smoothie yeah it's going to oxidize
it's<00:01:18.950> going<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.250> be<00:01:19.340> rancid<00:01:19.909> crap<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:21.229> I

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
it's going to be rancid crap and I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.710 
it's going to be rancid crap and I
definitely<00:01:21.560> would<00:01:21.800> not<00:01:21.890> drink<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.570> if<00:01:23.570> you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
definitely would not drink that if you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.529 
definitely would not drink that if you
put<00:01:23.899> in<00:01:23.990> kale<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.560> spinach<00:01:25.000> beet<00:01:26.000> greens<00:01:26.270> and

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
put in kale and spinach beet greens and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.219 
put in kale and spinach beet greens and
blueberries<00:01:27.369> another<00:01:28.369> super<00:01:29.229> antioxidant

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
blueberries another super antioxidant

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.060 
blueberries another super antioxidant
rich<00:01:30.910> fruits<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.060> vegetables<00:01:32.950> what<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.009> you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
rich fruits and vegetables what do you

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.130 
rich fruits and vegetables what do you
think<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.310> going<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.490> happen<00:01:35.050> anti<00:01:36.759> oxidant

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
think is going to happen anti oxidant

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.499 
think is going to happen anti oxidant
stops<00:01:39.140> oxidation<00:01:40.090> it's<00:01:41.090> one<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.420> reasons

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
stops oxidation it's one of the reasons

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.960 
stops oxidation it's one of the reasons
we<00:01:41.840> eat<00:01:42.050> these<00:01:42.229> foods<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.550> use<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> their

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
we eat these foods the use of their

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.800 
we eat these foods the use of their
antioxidant<00:01:44.330> content<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.520> putting

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
antioxidant content so putting

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.660 
antioxidant content so putting
antioxidant-rich<00:01:47.810> foods<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.440> blender<00:01:48.670> is

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
antioxidant-rich foods in the blender is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.240 
antioxidant-rich foods in the blender is
going<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.940> stop<00:01:50.210> them<00:01:50.420> from<00:01:51.320> oxidizing<00:01:52.509> okay

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
going to stop them from oxidizing okay

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.100 
going to stop them from oxidizing okay
juices<00:01:55.390> one<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.539> problems<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.929> have<00:01:57.080> with

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
juices one of the problems I have with

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.800 
juices one of the problems I have with
juices<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.709> you're<00:01:57.830> removing<00:01:58.099> the<00:01:58.280> fiber

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
juices is you're removing the fiber

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.990 
juices is you're removing the fiber
fiber<00:01:59.810> is<00:02:00.020> an<00:02:00.140> essential<00:02:00.440> nutrient<00:02:01.009> because

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
fiber is an essential nutrient because

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.639 
fiber is an essential nutrient because
it<00:02:02.149> allows<00:02:02.360> for<00:02:03.520> proper<00:02:04.520> colon<00:02:04.819> function<00:02:05.649> not

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
it allows for proper colon function not

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.919 
it allows for proper colon function not
just<00:02:06.860> cleaning<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> colon<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.849> with<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
just cleaning the colon out with the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.749 
just cleaning the colon out with the
soluble<00:02:09.440> fiber<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.950> actually<00:02:10.280> feeds<00:02:10.550> the

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
soluble fiber that actually feeds the

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.210 
soluble fiber that actually feeds the
bacteria<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.989> culture<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.440> living<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:13.069> your

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
bacteria the culture is living in your

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.660 
bacteria the culture is living in your
colon<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.360> probiotics<00:02:15.099> okay<00:02:16.099> these<00:02:16.250> fibers

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
colon the probiotics okay these fibers

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.330 
colon the probiotics okay these fibers
feed<00:02:16.910> them<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.569> they're<00:02:18.230> called<00:02:18.440> prebiotics

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
feed them and they're called prebiotics

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.790 
feed them and they're called prebiotics
the<00:02:19.489> fibers<00:02:19.849> actually<00:02:20.150> call<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.390> prebiotic

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the fibers actually call it a prebiotic

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.140 
the fibers actually call it a prebiotic
but<00:02:21.800> it's<00:02:21.920> really<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.340> soluble<00:02:22.880> fiber

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
but it's really just a soluble fiber

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.210 
but it's really just a soluble fiber
which<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.380> meat<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.680> an<00:02:24.860> apple<00:02:25.190> the

carrots anything sweet beats in your

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.809 
carrots anything sweet beats in your
juice<00:03:27.840> you're<00:03:29.099> upping<00:03:30.099> your<00:03:30.159> blood<00:03:30.400> sugar<00:03:30.639> big

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819

with sweet fruits or vegetables you're

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.449 
with sweet fruits or vegetables you're

good for you poor smoothies and all the
fibers<00:03:46.359> still<00:03:46.540> there<00:03:46.889> it's<00:03:47.889> been<00:03:48.129> beat<00:03:48.310> up<00:03:48.340> but

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.569 
fibers still there it's been beat up but
it's<00:03:48.729> still<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.409> so<00:03:50.409> you're<00:03:50.680> slowing<00:03:51.430> down

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
it's still there so you're slowing down

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.640 
it's still there so you're slowing down
the<00:03:51.790> absorption<00:03:51.909> of<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.389> sugar<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:53.590> a

the absorption of the sugar and it's a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.460
