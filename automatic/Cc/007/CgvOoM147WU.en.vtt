same this one puts out 268 the Accord is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.469 
same this one puts out 268 the Accord is
273<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:59.280> accordion<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> 5-speed<00:02:00.330> automatic

whereas the Camry and the six feet the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.660 
whereas the Camry and the six feet the
camera<00:02:03.720> also<00:02:03.900> has<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.620> sport<00:02:05.040> mode<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.460> can

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
camera also has a sport mode so you can

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240 
camera also has a sport mode so you can
shift<00:02:05.880> gears<00:02:06.180> manually<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:07.320> also<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
shift gears manually and also the the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
shift gears manually and also the the
Toyota<00:02:08.580> 6-speed<00:02:09.299> is<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.660> bit<00:02:09.959> smoother<00:02:10.440> on

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
Toyota 6-speed is a bit smoother on

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.789 
Toyota 6-speed is a bit smoother on
shifts<00:02:11.430> I'd<00:02:12.150> say<00:02:12.420> acceleration<00:02:13.049> they<00:02:13.290> feel

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
shifts I'd say acceleration they feel

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.800 
shifts I'd say acceleration they feel
about<00:02:13.980> even<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.640> Toyota<00:02:14.940> could<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.570> smidge

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
about even the Toyota could be a smidge

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.289 
about even the Toyota could be a smidge
quicker<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:17.160> around<00:02:17.340> six<00:02:17.640> five<00:02:17.790> seconds<00:02:18.239> or

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
quicker it's around six five seconds or

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.580 
quicker it's around six five seconds or
so<00:02:18.450> 260<00:02:18.950> both<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.130> them<00:02:20.250> ride<00:02:20.549> really<00:02:21.090> nice

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
so 260 both of them ride really nice

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.520 
so 260 both of them ride really nice
quite<00:02:22.590> comfortable<00:02:23.269> yet<00:02:24.269> they're<00:02:24.450> still<00:02:24.540> firm

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
quite comfortable yet they're still firm

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.100 
quite comfortable yet they're still firm
enough<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.830> give<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> sporty<00:02:26.910> or<00:02:26.940> feel<00:02:27.269> I'd

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
enough to give you a sporty or feel I'd

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.050 
enough to give you a sporty or feel I'd
say<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.650> Toyota<00:02:29.220> feels<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.580> little<00:02:29.790> bit

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
say that the Toyota feels a little bit

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.020 
say that the Toyota feels a little bit
firmer<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:31.530> again<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> SE<00:02:32.489> model<00:02:32.519> so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
firmer but again this is the SE model so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.720 
firmer but again this is the SE model so
it<00:02:33.269> does<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.630> sports<00:02:33.930> suspension<00:02:34.730> whereas

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it does have a sports suspension whereas

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.500 
it does have a sports suspension whereas
the<00:02:35.880> Accord

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the Accord

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.940 
the Accord
these<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.989> v6<00:02:38.349> is<00:02:38.500> all<00:02:38.620> at<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.830> same
