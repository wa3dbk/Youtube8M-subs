00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Mr. Hi Uesugi is a new work This time I will talk about the technique to remove the guard 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.559
 I think 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 Because removing the guard Ya piece of the street party in situ 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:20.240
 It is a technique to aim at the piece by attacking the piece protecting the important masu 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.270
 So let's look at the simple guard , no doctor 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.270
 The 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.750
 For example this position 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.100
 Here and now white is not that you have to attack the bishop due to this Fe shop is not 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.800
 It is protected 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.760
 So if it's a white board , white will attack b5 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.160
 And since I ran away, the guard of the shop was removed this day 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.380
 You can take an idol audition and get a piece 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.620
 The technique of removing the card in is an effective technique also when aiming at a checkmate etc. 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:03.100
 Please have a look at this position 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:07.150
 In this position is now a white board, but there are these two powerful pass pawns in black and then 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:14.020
 Aim for a checkmate from a check such as clean f 3 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:16.060
 Te There is also a muscle is white mail to a seemingly desperate situation, but Te here chestnut-One effect遊舞 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.439
 there is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:26.740
 We will not protest even the Queen in not only put a Well check 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:29.829
 Well , I'm going to take this country cleanly because I lose if I get a black frame person, but here 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.860
 The guard of the eighth step was removed in 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:36.050
 White is look d 8 check checkmate using this This gold does not run away 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.510
 so 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.940
 I was able to fight at university as it was cherry blossoms 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.450
 So let's stop the video because we have three more positions 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.890
 Please consider first the first position 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.909
 Clap 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.299
 Remove the guard at the 7th base 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.299
 Please try to stop winning the video and think 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.680
 This position is now attacking this pink is not this 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.710
 However, because it is protected by this pawn 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:19.680
 First subject is bishop take d 5 f 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:26.640
 Although guard in the night by first be erased this pawn of the check was out of 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 Well words this 浮黒is remains to take this day shop is white is taking next ed 4 and Sasuke 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.670
 It is a check 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.450
 This king can only escape to these three corners and after fleeing 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.620
 As protection without this has been removed 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:45.330
 Without this King Teppei White could get a piece 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.330
 No, let's enter into the second position 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.480
 The 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.900
 This is also a white turn Remove the card and aim for victory Stop the video and think about it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.900
 Please give me 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.550
 The point to focus on the correct answer for this position is that there is little room for this Ting 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.590
 It means 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.500
 For example, if here you Luke, for example, 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.280
 In such a place 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.569
 Good tobacco have 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:27.150
 It will come Chekkume' by and stab Might f 7 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.230
 Remove aim the white from the somehow here to protect this loop in this Potchon, etc. 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.000
 It is 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:38.820
 So here freshly refers to the white N Feeley Di 8 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:44.310
 At first glance is a hand to the clean, but black in here that f 7 have taken the queen with Luke 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.319
 Since the guard of the bark has been removed, I can not check white with f 7 and can checkmate 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.159
 I will 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:54.019
 And hardship is now queen attacked this night happy that are attacking this loop 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.300
 There is no way to protect 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:01.569
 So this is a loop, for example 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.659
 Well take this and this is white, for example 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.890
 Because it is exchange of Luke if I do not take it 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.569
 I was able to belong to 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.569
 Let's get into the last position 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:21.570
 This position is a bit difficult, so please think that you will stop the video 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.570
 I'm Square 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.980
 What I should pay attention to in this position 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.720
 By the queen dominating the common knowledge file 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.010
 We do not have this king method fluff 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:49.080
 So let's make it white here Look and take b 4 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:56.460
 First you will receive this day shock and since Well black've taken a Bishop 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:59.710
 It takes 9 intake b 4 and it is not white here and pay 9 d 5 e 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.330
 This t 7 not only attack Nomasu 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:09.039
 I 'm trying to fly, but why is that for example Queen fleeing somewhere 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.139
 In this e7, King can not escape to this h file 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:17.050
 I will be a checkmate 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.889
 And so on black you have to miss the queen and you have to protect this e 7 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.469
 but 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.320
 Serubikku called a pony 7 of the Come bishop also not to have control 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:30.009
 Point a queen 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:34.839
 Yeah Bishop take the good with the but behind was able to frame obtained 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:39.180
 So here is the video about the technique of removing your guard 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.180
 Thank you for watching
