another coming I don't know but I

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.400 
another coming I don't know but I
presume<00:02:25.060> they'll<00:02:25.420> probably<00:02:25.720> work<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.230> same

presume they'll probably work the same

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.780 
presume they'll probably work the same

base album or something I don't really
know<00:02:40.430> cuz<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.730> would<00:02:40.849> kind<00:02:40.969> of<00:02:41.090> defeat<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
know cuz I would kind of defeat the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.679

whole object of I don't I don't know

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.740 
whole object of I don't I don't know
it's<00:02:44.930> kind<00:02:45.439> of<00:02:45.739> baffling<00:02:46.480> because<00:02:47.480> I've<00:02:47.599> never

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's kind of baffling because I've never

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.349 
it's kind of baffling because I've never
seen<00:02:47.989> anything<00:02:48.379> hidden<00:02:49.010> towards<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.549> at<00:02:50.030> all

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
seen anything hidden towards this at all

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.429 
seen anything hidden towards this at all
before<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:52.030> unless<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.209> drained<00:02:53.480> away<00:02:53.659> again

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
before so unless it drained away again

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.809 
before so unless it drained away again
it<00:02:54.590> would<00:02:54.709> still<00:02:54.889> kill<00:02:55.129> everything<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
it would still kill everything in the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.490 
it would still kill everything in the
map<00:02:56.030> even<00:02:56.420> if<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.599> did<00:02:56.780> drain<00:02:56.989> away<00:02:57.109> at<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.379> end

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
map even if it did drain away at the end

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.770 
map even if it did drain away at the end
so<00:02:57.709> I'm<00:02:58.400> sure<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.760> final<00:02:59.090> way<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.299> balancing

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
so I'm sure the final way of balancing

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.009 
so I'm sure the final way of balancing
it<00:02:59.989> out<00:03:00.189> India<00:03:01.189> in<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.639> long<00:03:01.790> run<00:03:01.819> but<00:03:02.299> jet

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
it out India in the long run but jet

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.129 
it out India in the long run but jet
