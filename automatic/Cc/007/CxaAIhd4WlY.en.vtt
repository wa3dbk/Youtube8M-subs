00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.560
 do not 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.890
 We're going to need six medallions of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.500
 chicken this meat is similar to meat 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.320
 that we bought for hamburgers but 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.330
 it's chicken breast we're also going to 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.629
 need a can of cream 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.629
 mushrooms this tin of 300 grams 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.269
 there are different brands I bought this 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.769
 because it's the one I like but there's 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.600
 different brands of cream 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.979
 mushrooms and the cream already comes 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.909
 ready we will also need 150 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:59.280
 milliliters of water and 150 milliliters of 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.890
 milk to the chicken medallions 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.799
 we put a little salt and pepper 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.110
 this is optional if you do not want to put 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 You do not put salt on it but if you like a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.310
 little bit more of flavor because it can be 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.830
 put a little salt and pepper 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.260
 as well 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.860
 the medallions I'm going to laugh at this 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.500
 iron as you can see here I already have them 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.350
 this I'm going to leave 10 minutes I put 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.330
 a little bit of oil, nothing more if you 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.280
 they do not have this iron because they can 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.340
 fry in the pan with a little bit of 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.800
 oil in this case I already put the cap of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.410
 I'm going to stir a little bit so that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.200
 Warm up and put on a little more 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.200
 liquid now I'm going to add the water 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.230
 and I'm going to add the milk 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.620
 we are going to stir that they integrate very 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.200
 all ingredients well 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.080
 we will be stirring until 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.950
 boil and when it boils let's continue 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.930
 stirring for 3 minutes while 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.910
 does not boil this moment is it 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.610
 stirring stirring but you have to 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.930
 be aware that as soon as you start 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.080
 to boil we're going to have to be 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.040
 stirring and we will stir 3 minutes 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.990
 with 3 minutes and this will be ready 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.300
 medallions are already cooked as they can 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.000
 see these were like 7 minutes because 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.640
 so it was pretty hot now the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.030
 we will draw very carefully because 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.270
 This is like a little bit like that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.280
 prone to crumble we will clean 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.490
 a little bit to put the others because 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.660
 this one stayed a little bit like that 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.930
 damn this very carefully we're going 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.210
 to remove we are going to put a little more 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.210
 of oil to put other medallions 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.950
 here I have the cream since it is 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.550
 boiling and I'm not going to stop moving 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.990
 until the 3 minutes have passed and at 3 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.990
 I'm going to put out the fire 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.739
 and here I already have two other medallions that 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290
 they're ready to go and we're going to 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.830
 take out and already to put the other two that 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.250
 are missing as I told you before if you do not 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.319
 they have this iron this thing is called 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.010
 I think grill 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.689
 if they do not have this device they can 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.629
 fry the medallions can fry 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.760
 in a pan with a little oil of 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.030
 immuno his medallions place them in a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.810
 dish'll put some cream 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.810
 above 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.620
 I'm going to accompany these medallions with 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.530
 a little bit of the green soup we made 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.700
 Yesterday I hope you liked this 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.170
