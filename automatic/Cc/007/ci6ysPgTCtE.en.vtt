00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
she does like the bad boy as in Batman

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.979 
she does like the bad boy as in Batman
has<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.049> darker<00:02:22.560> edge<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.129> him<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.629> she

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
has that darker edge to him I think she

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.339 
has that darker edge to him I think she
does<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.470> Superman<00:02:26.040> because<00:02:27.110> he's<00:02:28.110> very

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
does like Superman because he's very

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.530 
does like Superman because he's very
similar<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.040> her<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.760> powers<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
similar to her in the powers and the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.110 
similar to her in the powers and the
strength<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.379> having<00:02:32.159> that<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.819> godly

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.080 
but I also think that she really likes
Batman<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.769> he's<00:02:37.950> completely<00:02:38.220> opposite

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.170 
Batman because he's completely opposite
of<00:02:39.150> her<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.750> opposites<00:02:40.230> attract<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.950> feel
