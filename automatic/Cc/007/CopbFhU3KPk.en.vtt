it<00:02:33.790> should<00:02:34.060> reboot<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.470> ISS<00:02:35.890> user<00:02:36.099> it

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
it should reboot and for the ISS user it

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.490 
it should reboot and for the ISS user it
should<00:02:36.670> tell<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.150> even<00:02:37.720> pineapples<00:02:38.260> fine

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
should tell and even pineapples fine

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.690 
should tell and even pineapples fine
tell<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.489> show<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.370> should<00:02:42.549> look

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
tell just show you so it should look

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.440 
tell just show you so it should look
like<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:45.099> should<00:02:45.340> reboot<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.000> some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
like this and it should reboot in some

00:02:46.450 --> 00:03:14.480 
like this and it should reboot in some
time

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.490 

so<00:03:15.490> once<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:15.940> rebooted<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.080> open<00:03:17.470> your
