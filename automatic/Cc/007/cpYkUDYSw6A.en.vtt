00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.080 

everyone<00:00:04.649> so<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.100> video<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:05.550> a<00:00:05.790> short

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090 
everyone so this video is just a short

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.310 
everyone so this video is just a short
introduction<00:00:06.690> into<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:08.180> I<00:00:09.180> produced<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:09.990> own

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
introduction into how I produced my own

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.730 
introduction into how I produced my own
power<00:00:10.709> distribution<00:00:11.039> blocks<00:00:12.020> so<00:00:13.020> a<00:00:13.289> power

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
power distribution blocks so a power

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.470 
power distribution blocks so a power
distribution<00:00:14.340> block<00:00:14.520> what<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.969> purpose

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
distribution block what is this purpose

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.560 
distribution block what is this purpose
well<00:00:15.980> what<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.070> does<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.820> takes<00:00:17.970> power<00:00:18.270> in

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
well what it does is it takes power in

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.040 
well what it does is it takes power in
from<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> battery<00:00:19.530> and<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.850> serves<00:00:21.540> as<00:00:21.870> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
from the battery and it serves as a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.770 
from the battery and it serves as a
source<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.680> other<00:00:23.130> power<00:00:23.850> connections<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.750> we

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
source for other power connections so we

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.070 
source for other power connections so we
have<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.350> line<00:00:25.590> coming<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.840> supplying<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
have one line coming in supplying the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.220 
have one line coming in supplying the
power<00:00:28.110> and<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.950> this<00:00:29.760> blocks<00:00:30.600> function

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
power and then this this blocks function

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.250 
power and then this this blocks function
is<00:00:31.440> to<00:00:31.590> distribute<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.219> power<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:33.390> multiple

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
is to distribute that power to multiple

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.800 
is to distribute that power to multiple
other<00:00:34.790> sinks<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.510> different

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
other sinks so we can have different

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.080 
other sinks so we can have different
sized<00:00:36.960> wires<00:00:37.320> coming<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.980> different<00:00:38.760> numbers

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
sized wires coming out different numbers

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170 
sized wires coming out different numbers
of<00:00:39.120> wires<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:41.280> quite<00:00:41.430> handy<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
of wires and it's quite handy when you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
of wires and it's quite handy when you
have<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> bunch<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> different<00:00:43.200> different

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
have a bunch of different different

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160 
have a bunch of different different
components<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> need<00:00:44.910> power<00:00:45.630> but<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> don't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
components that need power but you don't

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.780 
components that need power but you don't
want<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.380> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.560> bunch<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> wires<00:00:47.399> running

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
want to have a bunch of wires running

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.460 
want to have a bunch of wires running
directly<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.630> battery<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.380> to

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
directly to the battery you just want to

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.020 
directly to the battery you just want to
have<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.590> big<00:00:49.980> wire<00:00:50.220> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> battery

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
have one big wire going to the battery

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.389 
have one big wire going to the battery
and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.350> bunch<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.739> wires<00:00:53.100> coming

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and then a bunch of little wires coming

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.380 
and then a bunch of little wires coming
off<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.270> block<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.280> looked<00:00:56.760> around<00:00:56.820> online

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
off of a block so I looked around online

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.440 
off of a block so I looked around online
and<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.260> saw<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> different<00:00:59.120> different<00:01:00.120> power

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
and I saw a different different power

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.119 
and I saw a different different power

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
distribution blocks for sale mostly
through<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.030> car<00:01:03.270> audio<00:01:03.629> websites<00:01:04.110> but

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
through you know car audio websites but

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 
through you know car audio websites but
they<00:01:04.409> were<00:01:04.500> quite<00:01:04.680> expensive<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.519> sometimes

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
they were quite expensive and sometimes

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.529 
they were quite expensive and sometimes
hard<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.229> find<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.759> decided<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.149> make<00:01:09.329> my<00:01:09.509> own

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
hard to find so I decided to make my own

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.099 
hard to find so I decided to make my own
and<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.469> way<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> did<00:01:10.889> this<00:01:11.069> is<00:01:11.399> I<00:01:11.939> used<00:01:12.539> a<00:01:12.780> 3d

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
and the way I did this is I used a 3d

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.120 
and the way I did this is I used a 3d
printer<00:01:13.999> so<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.679> can<00:01:16.859> take<00:01:17.009> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
printer so you see if I can take this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.070 
printer so you see if I can take this
apart<00:01:17.459> here<00:01:17.639> quickly

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.270 

so<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.290> need<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.650> did<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so what you need to what I did is I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.380 
so what you need to what I did is I
designed<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:28.310> housing<00:01:29.310> plastic<00:01:29.850> housing<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
designed a housing plastic housing and I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.590 
designed a housing plastic housing and I
made<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.660> using<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.990> 3d<00:01:31.290> printer<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:32.570> what<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
made it using a 3d printer and what I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.400 
made it using a 3d printer and what I
had<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.710> large<00:01:35.010> hole<00:01:35.600> for<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.660> battery

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
had here is a large hole for the battery

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.570 
had here is a large hole for the battery
cable<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> come<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.190> is<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> power

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
cable to come in this is the power

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.120 
cable to come in this is the power
source<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.410> coming<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.830> read<00:01:41.040> out

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
source and then one coming out read out

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.400 
source and then one coming out read out
the<00:01:41.220> other<00:01:41.310> other<00:01:41.610> side<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.330> that's<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
the other other side and that's for the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.859 
the other other side and that's for the
main<00:01:43.650> power<00:01:44.070> draw<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.330> example<00:01:45.750> this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
main power draw so for example this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.300 
main power draw so for example this
distribution<00:01:46.560> block<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
distribution block is going in the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
distribution block is going in the
engine<00:01:47.610> bay<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.930> source

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
engine bay I want to have my source

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
engine bay I want to have my source
cable<00:01:49.680> coming<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.100> from<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.640> battery<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
cable coming in from the battery and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.109 
cable coming in from the battery and
then<00:01:51.420> my<00:01:51.890> biggest<00:01:52.890> draw<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
then my biggest draw will be to the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
then my biggest draw will be to the
engine<00:01:54.479> harness<00:01:54.840> itself<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:56.460> gonna

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
engine harness itself and that's gonna

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.870 
engine harness itself and that's gonna
be<00:01:56.700> connected<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> alternator<00:01:57.720> and

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
be connected to the alternator and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
be connected to the alternator and
powering<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> engine<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.470> sides

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
powering the engine but on the sides

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.560 
powering the engine but on the sides
here<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.040> also<00:02:02.280> wanted<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.880> some<00:02:03.300> options

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
here I also wanted to have some options

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.249 
here I also wanted to have some options
for<00:02:04.110> other<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.340> connectors<00:02:05.960> for<00:02:06.960> anything

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
for other I know connectors for anything

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
for other I know connectors for anything
else<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.619> might<00:02:07.710> need<00:02:07.860> power<00:02:08.070> in<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.700> engine

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
else that might need power in the engine

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.990 
else that might need power in the engine
bay<00:02:09.149> things<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:09.899> extra<00:02:10.140> fans<00:02:11.000> lights

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
bay things like maybe extra fans lights

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
bay things like maybe extra fans lights
whatever<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.810> name<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
whatever you name it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.310 
whatever you name it
so<00:02:14.010> what<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> need<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.940> do<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.510> get<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> brass

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
so what you need to do is get a brass

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.850 
so what you need to do is get a brass
bar<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.390> believe<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:20.090> 3/4<00:02:21.090> inch<00:02:21.860> square

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
bar I believe this is 3/4 inch square

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.270 
bar I believe this is 3/4 inch square
brass<00:02:23.280> bar<00:02:23.780> cut<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.989> size<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
brass bar cut it to size and then you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910 
brass bar cut it to size and then you
need<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> drill<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:27.239> holes<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.739> just

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
need to drill your holes so you just

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.530 
need to drill your holes so you just
drill<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.280> appropriately<00:02:29.790> sized<00:02:30.239> holes<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
drill the appropriately sized holes and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.610 
drill the appropriately sized holes and
you<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.840> line<00:02:34.019> up<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
you know they line up here with the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.330 
you know they line up here with the
holes<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:35.130> 3d<00:02:35.519> printed<00:02:35.910> housing<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
holes on 3d printed housing and then you

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.710 
holes on 3d printed housing and then you
have<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.580> drill<00:02:38.790> holes<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.239> top<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.690> a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
have to drill holes on the top and a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.840 
have to drill holes on the top and a
zipper<00:02:39.989> set<00:02:40.200> screws<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.100> what<00:02:41.310> happens<00:02:41.610> as<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
zipper set screws so what happens as the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.000 
zipper set screws so what happens as the
wire<00:02:42.030> goes<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:43.019> clamp<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.380> with<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.799> set

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
wire goes in you clamp down with the set

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.650 
wire goes in you clamp down with the set
screw<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> hold<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.670> wire<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:44.880> place<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
screw to hold the wire in place and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.600 
screw to hold the wire in place and
these<00:02:46.230> set<00:02:46.440> screws<00:02:46.709> are<00:02:46.860> also<00:02:47.010> made<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.400> brass

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
these set screws are also made of brass

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.520 
these set screws are also made of brass
and<00:02:47.640> brass<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> good<00:02:48.720> choice<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and brass is a good choice because it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.970 
and brass is a good choice because it
has<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:50.040> low<00:02:50.220> resistance<00:02:50.480> high<00:02:51.480> conductivity

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
has a low resistance high conductivity

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.729 
has a low resistance high conductivity
and<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.540> not<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:54.780> not<00:02:54.840> gonna<00:02:54.959> rust<00:02:55.260> it's

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and it's not it's not gonna rust it's

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.289 
and it's not it's not gonna rust it's
gonna<00:02:55.860> oxidize<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.670> bit<00:02:56.820> but<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.269> not

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
gonna oxidize a little bit but it's not

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.850 
gonna oxidize a little bit but it's not
gonna<00:02:57.510> rust<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.019> steel<00:02:58.290> bar<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> way<00:03:01.829> I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
gonna rust like a steel bar so the way I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.860 
gonna rust like a steel bar so the way I
produce<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.430> there<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> main<00:03:03.390> piece

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
produce this there is the main piece

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.819 
produce this there is the main piece
here<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.880> lid<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:07.769> we

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
here and then we have a lid so that we

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.560 
here and then we have a lid so that we
can<00:03:07.980> actually<00:03:08.100> put<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.549> brass<00:03:08.760> bar<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.299> and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
can actually put the brass bar in and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.870 
can actually put the brass bar in and
then<00:03:10.320> secure<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.709> using<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:12.120> lid<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
then secure it using the lid and the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.270 
then secure it using the lid and the
nice<00:03:15.030> thing<00:03:15.269> here<00:03:15.299> with<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.930> housing<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.560> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
nice thing here with this housing is it

part I want so this is gonna be housed
in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.740> engine<00:03:32.190> bay<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.580> have<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> separate<00:03:33.600> one

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
in the engine bay I have a separate one

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.570 
in the engine bay I have a separate one
that<00:03:33.960> I'll<00:03:34.050> be<00:03:34.170> housing<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.980> cabin<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
that I'll be housing and the cabin and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.230 
that I'll be housing and the cabin and
that<00:03:35.610> will<00:03:36.180> power<00:03:36.330> things<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.990> my<00:03:37.230> amplifier

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
that will power things like my amplifier

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.160 
that will power things like my amplifier
my<00:03:39.240> extra<00:03:40.110> gauges<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:42.510> know<00:03:42.630> other

my extra gauges and you know other

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.300 
my extra gauges and you know other
things<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:45.110> quite<00:03:46.110> cheap<00:03:46.350> takes<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
things like that so quite cheap takes a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.910 
things like that so quite cheap takes a
man<00:03:47.490> hour<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.940> machine<00:03:48.600> everything<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.680> 3d
