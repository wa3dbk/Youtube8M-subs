and<00:01:23.310> yes<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.939> some<00:01:24.119> instances<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.810> better

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and yes in some instances it is better

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
and yes in some instances it is better
but<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.799> didn't<00:01:26.130> feel<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.490> consistent

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
but it just didn't feel as consistent

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
but it just didn't feel as consistent
and<00:01:27.509> his<00:01:27.689> second<00:01:28.049> informed<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.619> me<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.410 
and his second informed it for me I
don't<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.100> why<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.210> just

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
don't know why that is but that's just

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.569 
don't know why that is but that's just
how<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> felt<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> me<00:01:30.990> piecewise<00:01:31.770> 75<00:01:32.369> paise

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
