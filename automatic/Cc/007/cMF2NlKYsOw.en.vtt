there<00:00:30.380> pull<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:31.940> when<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.120> turn<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
there pull it out then when I can turn a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
there pull it out then when I can turn a
little<00:00:33.870> bit<00:00:36.620> it's<00:00:37.620> coming<00:00:44.629> there<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
little bit it's coming there it is so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.639 
little bit it's coming there it is so
what<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.070> guess<00:00:47.309> how<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> works<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.410> see

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
what I would guess how it works you see

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.389 
what I would guess how it works you see
the<00:00:49.860> two<00:00:50.329> notches<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.890> gets<00:00:52.890> through<00:00:53.129> there

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the two notches all gets through there

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.439 
the two notches all gets through there
press<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.210> into<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.449> presses

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
press this into here and then presses

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
press this into here and then presses
the<00:00:57.570> barrel<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.280> oil

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the barrel out and you can see an oil

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360 
the barrel out and you can see an oil

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.880 
channel in the thread on the right hand
top<00:01:02.579> side<00:01:05.119> well<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.320> yeah<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.740> they

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
top side well if you have yeah if they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
top side well if you have yeah if they
get<00:01:08.070> stuck<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> low<00:01:09.570> oil

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
get stuck and if you have low oil

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100 
get stuck and if you have low oil
pressure<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> slacks<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> oil<00:01:12.810> gets

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pressure it slacks and if the oil gets

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:32.210 
pressure it slacks and if the oil gets
really<00:01:13.350> hot<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.740> slacks<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.159> well<00:01:17.659> yep<00:01:19.430> exactly

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.170 

I<00:01:32.660> have<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.810> put<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.250> quite<00:01:35.760> a<00:01:35.790> lot<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I have to put get it in quite a lot I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:51.050 
I have to put get it in quite a lot I
guess<00:01:42.380> should<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.470> start<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.800> engine<00:01:50.060> these

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
guess should we start the engine these

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.140 
guess should we start the engine these
easy<00:01:51.240> jobs<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.980> you<00:01:52.980> go<00:01:53.190> wrong<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.760> the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
easy jobs but you go wrong in the

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:16.400 
easy jobs but you go wrong in the
process<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.930> doing<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.350> yeah

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.360 

yeah<00:02:17.940> yeah<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.840> fear<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.430> really<00:02:21.430> good

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
yeah yeah you can fear that really good

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.080 
yeah yeah you can fear that really good
yeah<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.580> then<00:02:25.239> when<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.230> got<00:02:26.819> when<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:27.910> feel

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
yeah and then when you got when you feel

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.059 
yeah and then when you got when you feel
the<00:02:28.239> pressure<00:02:28.390> point<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.170> give<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.770> another

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
the pressure point and give it another

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.059 
the pressure point and give it another
half<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.180> turn<00:02:31.390> shall<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:32.319> give<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.620> try<00:02:32.770> then

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
half a turn shall we give it a try then

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:51.420 
half a turn shall we give it a try then
you<00:02:42.599> can<00:02:43.599> still<00:02:43.870> hear<00:02:44.019> that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:09.470 

I<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.930> hear<00:03:03.060> from<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.829> hiya<00:03:07.530> again

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.210 

and<00:03:26.909> I'm<00:03:27.060> really<00:03:27.269> tight<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.870> already<00:03:29.930> yeah

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
and I'm really tight on it already yeah

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.160 
and I'm really tight on it already yeah
okay<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.730> guess<00:03:33.060> that's<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.780> valves

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
okay so I guess that's just the valves

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.080 
okay so I guess that's just the valves
then<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:34.950> I've<00:03:35.939> got<00:03:36.180> an<00:03:36.299> oil<00:03:36.510> leak<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.909> is

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
then and I've got an oil leak so this is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.569 
then and I've got an oil leak so this is
how<00:03:39.299> you're<00:03:39.480> supposed<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.870> set<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.140> now<00:03:40.579> so

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
how you're supposed to set it now so

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.870 
how you're supposed to set it now so
