00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.890
 moments but was not my ankles good 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.890

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.000

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:20.849

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.930
 nice but here I am here 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.940
 then for the face I have a lot of 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.160
 good face stuff then we 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 start with that I still finished a 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 cleansing oil from the body 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.020
 shop 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.239
 obviously I buy back I will test 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.250
 that of Occitan I will try to 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.890
 try that of Occitan and I would like 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450
 many tested that of bobby brown 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.230
 that of cabbage and me obviously at the stadium 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.900
 I obviously bought then I 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.750
 finished a check that my deep mask 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 clean invigorating cleansing gel I loved 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.360
 this thing from us too embarrassing it's 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 a hope a scrub actually does that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.890
 cleans the steps thoroughly with 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.690
 microphones biya energizing energy 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.880
 for a fresh skin check all 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.070
 skin types it was really great 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.900
 because it's huh 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.340
 an action on the excess of sebum and when 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.260
 I was using it's weird to say but I 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.750
 I regret less quickly I regret less 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.180
 fast with that frankly it's a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.459
 kill and listen that slab what finally I 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.540
 recommended him to my little cousin 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.030
 who starts to have acne 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.250
 but this stuff is really great is 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.530
 the neutrogena scrubs I find them 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.450
 excellent exfoliants like this 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.780
 they listen to cheap quality report 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.790
 prices just top so yes I buy 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.050
 I have another neutrogena I that I 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.910
 to use but I will buy back a 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.770
 time slot 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.319
 then always in the face I have a 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.030
 mask actually that I forgot is the 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.100
 stampede can and it annoys me actually 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.530
 that's what he was hidden in the fridge 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.730
 and suddenly I ruined all that I can 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.600
 really not use it because it's 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.170
 expired since the last year 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.290
 over a year ago badens tomorrow this 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.880
 will do a year ago so here I can not 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.800
 use it really annoys me because 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.950
 I had it and but I use it and 3 4 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.269
 time but it's a shame because when 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.130
 I find them and said shit 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.790
 but why he was at the bottom of the fridge 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.030
 So that's a bit pissed off so 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.650
 I do not know I do not know if I 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.530
 will actually buy the coup one can if I 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.390
 do not have this thesis tested enough in am 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.000
 so in the last mtv where I said 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.919
 I had finished the cleaning foam 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.960
 of the 1 2 3 2 at clinic so I have 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.330
 finished the rest so so this is a 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.040
 emisssion tool so the lotion and has 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.260
 created a wait that I would not buy back 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.690
 unfortunately I bought the 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.910
 solution 1 2 3 for oily skin so 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.520
 the classic for combination to oily skin 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.680
 and in large size because I 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.600
 love this one was fine but I find 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.640
 that she did not have any actions on 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.789
 the buttons in fact there is one of three 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.910
 as well then I have a toothpaste 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.919
 almost I like to talk about toothpaste but 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.020
 so I always use college 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.360
 colgate max right one 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.789
 so that's the basic I have in this 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.950
 moment I have it even more with 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.900
 microbeads and all but salmon 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.630
 toothpaste so prefer that yes I 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.910
 buy back would then do I have 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.830
 makeup so I still finished a 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.900
 eraser place of chesnay yvelines 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.330
 here I go back only by that it is 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.919
 that's how I already said yes yes I 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.780
 buy them I still use it and I 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.950
 will redeem again because so I can 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.210
 find it because it's right 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.650
 topissime end when you have two there 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.030
 and I believe that the line there too I 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.530
 believe not in fact I'm sure at every 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.630
 time he tells me I'm letting myself eat 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.699
 the same but when you have some 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.009
 imperfections to correct it is just up 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.460
 hide dark circles while leaving a 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.229
 morning a natural effect finally it's top 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.759
 and if you do not want to buy a brush 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.259
 in all that is not terrible you 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.580
 do you apply then you tap 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:49.849
 so here I love it and then I'm done 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.300
 a touch burst a girlfriend a touch 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.500
 glow from daily more than I love it 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.800

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.020
 spain it's a killed here it's for 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.580
 to illuminate is a slaughter so here we go 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.310
