00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
system with vista so basically the first

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.630 
system with vista so basically the first
thing<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.849> need<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.540> make<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.740> partition

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
thing you need to do is make a partition

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390 
thing you need to do is make a partition
on<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:18.000> hard<00:00:18.240> drive<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.130> open

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
on your hard drive to do this just open

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.769 
on your hard drive to do this just open

manage it's going to bring our user
account<00:00:25.619> control<00:00:25.740> which<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.369> obviously

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
account control which you obviously

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
account control which you obviously
continue<00:00:29.960> after<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.109> done<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:32.130> pop

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
continue after that's done it will pop

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.680 
continue after that's done it will pop
up<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.680> computer<00:00:34.680> management<00:00:35.070> window

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
up with the computer management window

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
up with the computer management window
so<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so from here you go on to this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
so from here you go on to this
management<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.430> it'll<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.790> connecting<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the new partitions of the disks and that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.689 
the new partitions of the disks and that
kind<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.820> stuff<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.480> I've<00:00:51.539> already<00:00:51.719> made<00:00:52.020> my

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I've already made my partition here so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
I've already made my partition here so
what<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> need<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> have

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
two hard drives that both showing up

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.260 
two hard drives that both showing up
here<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> petition<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> hard

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
here and this is a petition of this hard

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
here and this is a petition of this hard
drive<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.260> whatever<00:01:02.250> hard<00:01:02.489> drive<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> want

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to use you to have enough memory free

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
to use you to have enough memory free
and<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.150> click<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> shrink

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and you right click on that and shrink

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.289 
and you right click on that and shrink
volume<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
volume and then it will do this and

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
volume and then it will do this and
after<00:01:12.299> its<00:01:13.010> found<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> amount<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:15.650> space<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
after its found the amount of space you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
after its found the amount of space you
can<00:01:17.009> shrink<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> by<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.570> come<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.900> with

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
can shrink it by it will come up with

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.380 
can shrink it by it will come up with
this<00:01:19.350> window<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.530> use<00:01:22.939> to

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.450 

decrease<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.420> size<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.979> once<00:01:29.310> you've

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
decrease the size of it and once you've

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
decrease the size of it and once you've
done<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.700> you'll<00:01:30.180> end<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.600> another

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
done that you'll end up with another

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.920 
done that you'll end up with another
space<00:01:31.380> which<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.130> format<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.750> in

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
space which you can then format so in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.499 
space which you can then format so in
the<00:01:34.110> amount<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.409> space<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.490> megabytes<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the amount of space so in megabytes so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
the amount of space so in megabytes so
you<00:01:37.020> want<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.290> decent<00:01:37.650> amount<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.070> space

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you want a decent amount of space

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.490 
you want a decent amount of space
obviously<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> only<00:01:39.650> not<00:01:40.650> enough<00:01:41.119> so

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
obviously this is only not enough so

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.819 
obviously this is only not enough so
that's<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.680> ideal<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.220> funny<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:46.070> there<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
that's not ideal is funny about there so

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.440 
that's not ideal is funny about there so
make<00:01:49.829> enough<00:01:50.130> space<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.610> done<00:01:50.759> mine<00:01:50.970> forty

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
make enough space have done mine forty

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.139 
make enough space have done mine forty
eight<00:01:51.570> gigabytes<00:01:52.110> which<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.250> enough<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.939> me

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
eight gigabytes which is enough for me

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.200 
eight gigabytes which is enough for me
so<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.259> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.770> now<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.909> once

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
so what you want to do now is then once

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
so what you want to do now is then once
you<00:01:57.360> got<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> new<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.229> will<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> new<00:01:58.829> space

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you got the new you will be a new space

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.050 
you got the new you will be a new space
which<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.659> click<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.549> then<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
which you then right click and then you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.240 
which you then right click and then you
press<00:02:03.299> format<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.310> when<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.460> format<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:07.250> do

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
press format and when you format you do

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.240 
press format and when you format you do
the<00:02:08.369> volume<00:02:08.759> label<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.780> then

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the volume label and all that and then

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
the volume label and all that and then
you<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.580> option<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.810> change<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.349> drive

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you get an option to change the drive

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
you get an option to change the drive
pulse<00:02:14.310> which<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.640> need<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.849> change<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
pulse which we need to change it to a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.990
