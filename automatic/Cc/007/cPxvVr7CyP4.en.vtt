00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.950
 hello to all these kids 6023 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.830
 for a first comment tour 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.530
 so you'll have noticed I'm a 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.210
 girl yes I know it's pretty rare in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 this kind of game but hey we still 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 some doubts 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 so if some people will play 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.110
 with me there is really no problem what 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.300
 will be with great pleasure 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 so you can oiled 360 game and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.290
 my gamer tag is listed in the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 description of the video 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.960
 so here you are adding me then 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 precisely in the comments if that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.850
 would interest you to make a real 100 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.280
 against me and then I'll ask if he 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 wills the pilot for me on his 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 Youtube channel 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.690
 so that's for my first video going 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.620
 play in the country 90 silent as to 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:30.060
 tangier price undetectable tracker and 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.979
 assassin so I wanted to assault with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.439
 which as strict strategic package 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.180
 the predator missiles and the helicopter 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.979
 of attack 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:43.979
 so I play almost all the time with 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.110
 here it is so I am on the mass 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.990
 fallen that is not a map that 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.560
 I highly appreciate on the wii a little 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 more here I was blocked gentlemen 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.740
 predator who macerate years he's my 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.960
 parcel strategy for once i'm going 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.210
 develop something not too bad 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.299
 in a strategic package 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.910
 it's quite rare but good so here we are 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.280
 see right away that I unlock between 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.880
 dassault but when I get shot 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.830
 I will not launch it now so 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.800
 then said me too in the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.490
 comments if you like me 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.200
 and vincent way a dual how tahri 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.130
 here you tell me if you like it 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130
 or you would not like it 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.160
 then tell me what you think of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.129
 the and 90 me I think it's in 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.239
 not bad is there she has a lot of bullets 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:44.590
 she is me well I prove she is 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:47.510
 stable value was fine and I'm going 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.040
 do a lot of kiel with you not want 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.870
 spoil the suspense 1 I leave you 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.069
 watch 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.090
 put yourself in the end I counted the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:00.110
 belgian kick world so then I 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:05.410
 have never been able to finally this point of view 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.489
 it was to make a youtube channel or 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.880
 a facebook page 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.180
 this is to be seen according to the number of goals 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.319
 is to make video 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.720
 so as I'm going to see there are a lot of 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.720
 its 15 and well about forty in the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:30.110
 part you do not normally have 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:33.500
 luck but hey I'm going to end my 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.690
 assault yellow it's now and so 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.880
 I did exactly in style with so 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.470
 I invite you to stay 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.040
 until the end of the video 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.350
 because I came in more than small 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.250
 bonus to me it's two little clips that 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.579
 I realized and that's so I finish 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.040
 also say that the video I do them based 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.019
 beast this morning so here it was my 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.269
 very first video of your day 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:07.370
 so I was pretty happy so the age 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.639
 and at the end of this part makes a 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.819
 pretty good score so I 'm not telling you 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.950
 again but I made a very good score 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.750
 then I wanted to say that I had me 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.580
 I had preorder blackhawks 2 so 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.020
 I hope that will be blue v3 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.669
 because on 1 mw 3 the community and 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.680
 when a lot still I find 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.199
 you can tell and when a lot and 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.070
 I made my debut on black ops 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.900
 So here so as you can see 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.139
 I unlocked my second package 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.160
 strategic is also my second 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.440
 predator missile again 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.320
 unfortunately I did not have my 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.639
 the helicopter attacked but I have a 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.880
 hot source wrongly it's really 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.940
 happy to do once again in 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.669
 simple that is in my package 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.520
 strategic 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.710
 so here is a little thought advancing 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.979
 because it's a reaper and my brother has 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.610
 never thought with these parcels so is 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.280
 here he has big rollers 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.780
 they are perched yet he has denigrated 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.660
 perched we were not his stefoy 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.930
 so in addition I was unlucky 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.430
 this time I was stuck in drones 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:33.610
 I was a bit of a verdict then 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.949
 I would like the video to be fine 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.840
 shared that she be seen many times 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.880
 I would like it would please me - 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.770
 advancing because vincent 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.729
 he wants to be more 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:54.370
 know and he works a lot on these 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:56.409
 videos for you bah watch them in 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.310
 with good quality and so on 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:03.270
 so here I'd like it 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.159
 be well shared etc 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.199
 if you liked this video you can 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.259
 write it in the comments because 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.900
 it was my very first so that's it 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.889
 so if you liked it I 'll do it 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.840
 surely another 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.050
 so as you can see I come 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.900
 to kill me with a great ump because 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.360
 I am told is maybe if she has 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.349
 many seen why not make a faith 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.120
 how tahri 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:33.300
 that's where it says if you like it or not 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.190
 offers ideas I'm told after so 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.240
 as you can see the video she 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.820
 coming to an end so during the video 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.770
 I did not camp in fact one like in the 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.970
 most of my parts I have a lot 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.310
 rock so here I have tried the 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.320
 I tried it last but 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.380
 unfortunately I did not manage to 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.010
 to do but it does not matter it was 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.490
 that last 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:02.760
 as you can see we won and 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:09.000
 I finished my game on a pretty good 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:13.530
 score so here it stays but bonuses to 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.669
 the end so watch let me not hurt my 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:23.330
 the quilliam to the ump 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:23.330
 So here I tell you at +10 or two
