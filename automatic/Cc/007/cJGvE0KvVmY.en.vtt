00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello, today's review will be 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.910
 interesting for needlewomen for those who 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.440
 makes pictures makes a product out of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.180
 polymer clay plastics 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:29.990
 on the knock we get metal sticks 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.990
 the balls are such a set of heavy 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.870
 the smallest are all double sided 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.760
 the largest 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.760
 balls spinning can be twisted 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.589
 here is silicone insert for 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:03.339
 convenience that the metal is cold to 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.019
 it wasnâ€™t cold and it was convenient 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.110
 keep such professional 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.030
 tools for ease of use i 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.759
 I found a very sensible video in which 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.039
 shows how to work with such 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.070
 sticks on which at both ends 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.560
 are the balls they are used in at 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.080
 working with plastic or polymer clay 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.600
 cold porcelain and for example us 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.299
 it is necessary to process the flower petal 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.819
 so that he looked realistic 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.330
 for this we take a ball for such 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:38.259
 petals we need small and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.170
 horizontally begin to introduce a ball 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:46.860
 on the petal do smoothly and circular 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.770
 movements we look what happened 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.170
 petal became a little bulging we take 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:00.990
 big ball and start it 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.990
 modifying spend edges 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.409
 note that in one stack 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.960
 place 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.440
 Driving is not recommended 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.640
 make smooth circular movements with us 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.220
 turned petal pretty realistic 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.290
 he looks like a real one 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.260
 I hope the information turned out to be 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.120
