00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
having two more episodes left but I'm

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.460 
having two more episodes left but I'm
confident<00:05:46.430> if<00:05:46.610> they<00:05:47.030> do<00:05:47.090> this<00:05:47.450> right<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.050> they

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
confident if they do this right and they

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.080 
confident if they do this right and they
don't<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:49.100> know<00:05:49.190> go<00:05:49.460> down<00:05:49.640> some<00:05:49.880> sort<00:05:50.000> of

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
don't you know go down some sort of

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.510 
don't you know go down some sort of
weird<00:05:50.360> path<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.960> separate<00:05:51.410> animate<00:05:52.190> only

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
weird path to a separate animate only

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.159 
weird path to a separate animate only
ending<00:05:52.910> and<00:05:53.090> just<00:05:53.419> leave<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:53.630> open<00:05:53.990> up<00:05:54.050> the

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
ending and just leave it open up the

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.719 
ending and just leave it open up the
cliffhanger<00:05:54.710> that<00:05:54.740> I<00:05:54.919> think<00:05:55.190> they<00:05:55.370> can<00:05:55.430> do

cliffhanger that I think they can do

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.550 
cliffhanger that I think they can do
they<00:05:55.940> will<00:05:56.150> be<00:05:56.180> a<00:05:56.390> season<00:05:56.810> two<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:57.050> everything
