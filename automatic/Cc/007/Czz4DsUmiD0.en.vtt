00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:27.649 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:30.589 

then<00:05:28.649> use<00:05:29.159> an<00:05:29.309> eyeshadow<00:05:29.489> to<00:05:29.999> outline<00:05:30.569> your

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.749 
collar bones to make them look more bode
and<00:05:34.199> then<00:05:34.529> I<00:05:34.559> use<00:05:34.949> this<00:05:35.129> piece<00:05:35.429> of<00:05:35.609> like<00:05:35.729> a

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.519 
and then I use this piece of like a
what's<00:05:36.629> it<00:05:36.749> called<00:05:36.779> it<00:05:37.049> was<00:05:37.139> like<00:05:37.229> a<00:05:37.319> hamper

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
what's it called it was like a hamper

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:38.989 
what's it called it was like a hamper
and<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:37.949> cut<00:05:38.159> it<00:05:38.279> up<00:05:38.399> and<00:05:38.519> I<00:05:38.609> like<00:05:38.759> it<00:05:38.879> better

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
and I cut it up and I like it better

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.759 
and I cut it up and I like it better
than<00:05:39.239> fishnets<00:05:39.749> because<00:05:40.049> it<00:05:40.139> doesn't<00:05:40.379> stretch

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:40.769 
than fishnets because it doesn't stretch

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:43.069 
than fishnets because it doesn't stretch
and<00:05:41.039> then<00:05:41.129> therefore<00:05:41.369> doesn't<00:05:41.759> smudge<00:05:42.209> again

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:43.079 
and then therefore doesn't smudge again

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.379 
and then therefore doesn't smudge again
I<00:05:43.259> used<00:05:43.559> some<00:05:43.949> water<00:05:44.189> activated<00:05:44.549> paints<00:05:45.209> in

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
I used some water activated paints in

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.159 
I used some water activated paints in
blue<00:05:45.599> and<00:05:45.809> red<00:05:46.079> to<00:05:46.349> make<00:05:46.709> a<00:05:46.889> um<00:05:47.809> what<00:05:48.809> you<00:05:48.959> call

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169
