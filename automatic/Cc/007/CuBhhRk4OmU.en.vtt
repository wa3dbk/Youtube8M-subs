00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.980
 hello welcome to this video 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.139
 comparative on accessories cannes 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.730
 happy today subject of which we are going 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.950
 speak it sets caterpillars 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.240
 in fact we will talk about the benefits of 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.710
 characteristics and above all we are going 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.509
 want to compare them with the competition 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 for that I went last 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.169
 with me who is product manager for 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.669
 accessories channel offers halal 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.230
 what I would like to know in fact for 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.970
 to start is what she wants 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.920
 even forbid when I want to buy 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.450
 a set of caterpillars a lot of 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.890
 factors to consider a christian 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.020
 for sure people are brought to 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.090
 consider price is an item that is a 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.910
 subject but many other factors 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.400
 the ground clearance the contact surface the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.050
 design lachenaie the installation the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.000
 guaranteed a lot of factors 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.710
 just take second will show you 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.690
 the skies of competition one in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.250
 will come back on lafarge for canam 60 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.160
 must be easy a lot of competitors 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.040
 different tickets makes the first 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.380
 factor that we do not notice is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.269
 the profile is right angle forward so 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.829
 with a right angle profile nav is a 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.689
 little bit harder to turn to 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.790
 things that were obvious in his 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.369
 together those who use a bed a 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.080
 list below even though we say that 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.940
 it's a set of four caterpillars 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.350
 seasons we use in the running to 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.479
 maintain the craze of the caterpillar 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.590
 so it's not very obvious because 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.470
 a lot of contacts and a lot of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 friction at will on the guides here 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.440
 we see a band 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.390
 we have a system that is very much 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.299
 more effective completely different from 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 this one if we look back from 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.930
 3.60 system 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.760
 the first thing you notice is 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.979
 the profile is an aggressive profile in 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.110
 back much more aggressive canada and 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.240
 powerful there is a balance to be made 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.250
 to return too aggressive because we want 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.630
 not to dig a hole then not that he 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 know we will miss jitters silence 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 we think we have the perfect 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 swing of one here if I come back on my 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.670
 guides to maintain the alignment of the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.900
 shirt of an important one we have a lot 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.120
 many guides 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.140
 to mold in the fireplace because we 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.060
 wants to make sure he's not 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 set chaining when learning 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.800
 ok mountain with our set there 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.690
 there is no iss so we go 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.369
 with the wheels on heals six have 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.380
 matured in the chimney is very very 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.060
 performing in caterpillars so 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.520
 the iris of caterpillar beads with 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 soils - otherwise there is a 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.600
 compartment so here actually to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.360
 differences if you look 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.310
 spacing grids and that's a name 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.900
 when we lose we can buy it 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.420
 to know also that we have just lost 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.680
 our day probably deliver a 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.209
 caterpillar when caught in the woods 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.250
 it's something to lift the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.630
 vehicle for their doctor in place for 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.680
 their descent is a matter of 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.470
 some we want to spend 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.590
 ok ok here the other thing we can 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.240
 notice is we have access for if we have 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.620
 need to remove the licks they want 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.330
 put back the streets we want to make a 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.170
 permutation red caterpillars quickly 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.140
 during the season 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.820
 here we have access to the 4 white with with 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 our system versus a system of 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.250
 competition 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.350
 yes so to this game it's too bolts 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.820
 be turned the caterpillar to come 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.470
 take off the fourth beat and a little 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.760
 more effort for me because it takes 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.600
 I want neither drogba I need you 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.150
 are also the exact hockey in the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.150
 chimney also we have a set of road 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.760
 more than the competition and then in 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.090
 each one of us has bearings 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.130
 double ball single hic being still a 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.180
 times these maintenance issues these 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.950
 reliability issues 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.630
 it says it's a four system 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.450
 seasons but really been rolled into the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.180
 evoked case ok so we'll go to 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.010
 before I show you again the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.650
 loose profile nor lachenaie iban design 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.959
 important and if we notice our profile 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.150
 the crawler forward is English to 45 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.340
 so judge not I come back on my turns 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.930
 in places signoret 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.230
 redheaded runners we have a lot of turns 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.700
 to make it easier the direction here if 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.890
 I if you look 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.840
 profiles are fairly close in 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.629
 going and then are online and with the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.800
 wheels like that facilitates driving 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.900
 a lot less vibration 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:04.140
 so when I'm driving in fact we 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:06.269
 feel less so ok what we have and 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.769
 unique also on the apache system 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.780
 it is that we can vary the angle 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.620
 attacked the thing when one is in snow 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.239
 deep 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.000
 we would like to have more contacts at 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.889
 ground when one is a hard ground - 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.220
 ground contact will make driving easier 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.560
 my election so here we just do this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.600
 lake is the standard then we have a lot of 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.330
 adjusted facility is dependent on 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.280
 conditions of the day so that actually 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.470
 the game rises in the morning fell from 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.690
 Snow edge and I just wanted 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.370
 do this loan committee for 15 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.030
 minutes go around the four corners 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.040
 after ok another thing noticed in 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.080
 our unique system is that we 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.060
 has an imitating cable so that's fine 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.190
 prevent that berthod wheels that is 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.510
 a break in the driving system a 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.740
 thing also that we say we hear 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.110
 often speak is that with 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.669
 caterpillars in the bottom it's more is 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.630
 normally only with wheels in fact to 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.430
 try to turn the ball 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.750
 actually you have a lot of contact 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.200
 on the ground so it's a little bit more 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.450
 difficult 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.830
 what we did at canam with that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.600
 we developed a module 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.550
 electronic that plugs into a 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
 computer that is maximizing the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.180
 brain power direction ok so 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.680
 one maximizes to brain elections 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.330
 it's easier to turn and then 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.000
 as long as we do we will correct at the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.770
 reading the domain to read the 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.330
 words nor speed with a system of 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.310
 caterpillars whether that's the competition where 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.350
 a standard track system that's 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.840
 that the speed drive and rolls pretty 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.860
 nearly 40% too fast compared to this 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.389
 we see lhenry hockey in the background 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.800
 as subconscious you have that a 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.349
 world our next interviews or just 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.660
 wood it is not guaranteed that it 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.669
 can have an effect the ecologists dps 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.340
 coins comes all because I go out you read 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.680
 the right speed that counts the good 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.669
 balance sheet but I think it gives us 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.620
 a good idea there in terms of 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.330
 the ipo sets 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.280
 but what side by side now here 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.500
 what we actually saw there had been 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.660
 with him too we have a set of 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.250
 caterpillars that's different actually does that 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.949
 it's another page 360 that was 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.650
 developed specifically for mountain biking the 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.970
 3 60lt been developed specifically for 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.400
 vehicles side by side 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.479
 the back is longer or we speak 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.250
 of a vehicle that is heavier 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.470
 we know that people will charge the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.680
 box so we want to spread the short on 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.240
 more soffiati but the two caterpillars 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.680
 what is interesting is that the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.810
 two have the same concept we can vary 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.479
 the angles of attacked one speaks of bering 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.370
 we talk about ground clearance 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.250
 the commander imposes the ground clearance of 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.449
 more than the system the competition that 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.539
 so it's interesting 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.740
 the guarantee with brp kennels have been 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.960
 validated at the same time as the vehicles 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.850
 so you talk about workout art 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.520
 that you talk about executive parts 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.960
 everything is guaranteed to the same thing as I 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.370
 think that's a good point too from the 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.970
 guarantee you must never forget those there 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:50.280
 do theirs if we do not have the baffles 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.750
 kids listen allen thank you very much I 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.889
 think we have a lot of information 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.419
 interesting information 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.220
 I hope they were informative 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.599
 for you we also suggest you 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.400
 watch other videos comparative 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.380
 which are available the part of arenas 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.470
 and myself thank you very much for being 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.470
 the
