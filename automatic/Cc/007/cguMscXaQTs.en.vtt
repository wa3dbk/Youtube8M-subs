00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 to make you see better how 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.270
 knot in the hook I took a piece of fil 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.519
 Iron that has folded to give mo 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.910
 this is a great love account that is a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.429
 boar fashion and learned a string that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.900
 simulates the fishing line 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.820
 we tied the fishing line on the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
 cane tip and we have the part 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 wire end 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 we must admit after putting the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 float that slips clearly 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
 Once there the hand can 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 put we take our love this is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.770
 the final part and this is the part 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 of the hook the final part goes from the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 part of the hook we do this 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.789
 let's scroll until we have more 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.879
 thread to do to make the threads then 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.920
 we ask the thread this way 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.000
 then the final part always here 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 close 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 the noose bending only the thread then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.969
 on this other side we start to go 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 to wrap it around the mo and the thread 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.680
 or that other we take all the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.320
 wire we keep in tension with the wire of 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.830
 tip because the more he intends this is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.580
 the more beautiful the knot becomes , the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.150
 windings'll show a little more 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.770
 wide at least to see well we take from 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.340
 part of here now we start from 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340
 border 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.770
 let's do a lot of spire this case 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.880
 because there is the big thread 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.880
 then once we finish our coils 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.049
 we have the noose, this is the thread 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 at the end we are going to insert it in the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:02:00.750
 noose so and now there is nothing else 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.070
 that pull the end also on the tip 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.070
 what happens to this 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.250
 city ​​era 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.040
 and this is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.900
 9 of the year
