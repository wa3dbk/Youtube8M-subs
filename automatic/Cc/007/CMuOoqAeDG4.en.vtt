running back the lead role is one of my

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.710 
running back the lead role is one of my
favorite<00:00:16.980> place<00:00:17.160> here's<00:00:17.670> why<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.449> run<00:00:18.630> it

favorite place here's why you can run it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
favorite place here's why you can run it
out<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.990> any<00:00:19.199> formation<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.369> looks<00:00:20.730> just

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
out of any formation and it looks just

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.540 
out of any formation and it looks just
like<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.210> pest<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.050> also<00:00:22.740> allows<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.279> better

chance at play action because the run
looks<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> past<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.269> use

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
looks just like the past and you can use

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.240 
looks just like the past and you can use
either<00:00:27.900> run<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> set<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> path<00:00:29.010> or<00:00:29.220> the

defense<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> here's<00:00:35.790> an<00:00:35.910> example<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.630> see

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
defense and here's an example you see

defense and here's an example you see
right<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.469> basic<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
right here we have your basic I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
formation and what we're going to do

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720 
formation and what we're going to do
against<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> 50<00:00:40.739> front<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> how<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
against a 50 front you show you how the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
against a 50 front you show you how the
leader<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.530> effective<00:00:44.129> now

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
leader out of the I can be effective now

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.650 
leader out of the I can be effective now
here<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.879> right<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> wide

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
here we have right here you see the wide

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
here we have right here you see the wide
receiver<00:00:45.960> both<00:00:46.950> flanked<00:00:47.309> out<00:00:47.460> any

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
receiver both flanked out any

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
receiver both flanked out any
traditional<00:00:48.329> set<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.899> reason<00:00:49.230> why<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.620> have

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
traditional set the reason why we have

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
traditional set the reason why we have
these<00:00:49.950> guys<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> safety<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
these guys going to the safety is to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.299 
these guys going to the safety is to
block<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> give<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
block is because you want to give the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.610 
block is because you want to give the
illusion<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.390> pass<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.110> that's<00:00:55.320> why<00:00:55.440> they're

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
illusion of a pass so that's why they're

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.750 
illusion of a pass so that's why they're
going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> safeties<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.489> blocking

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
going to the safeties are not blocking

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
going to the safeties are not blocking
the<00:00:56.910> cornerbacks<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.629> cornerback<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the cornerbacks the cornerback see you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
the cornerbacks the cornerback see you
TTYL<00:00:59.070> receivers<00:00:59.430> bail<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> line<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
TTYL receivers bail out the line of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.520 
TTYL receivers bail out the line of
scrimmage<00:01:00.390> they're<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> backpedal

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
scrimmage they're going to backpedal

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810 
scrimmage they're going to backpedal
they're<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> bail<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> turn<00:01:02.640> their

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
they're going to bail out and turn their

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.910 
they're going to bail out and turn their
hips<00:01:03.030> therefore<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> wide<00:01:04.379> receiver<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
hips therefore the wide receiver can to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
hips therefore the wide receiver can to
get<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> safeties<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.330> parties<00:01:06.840> are

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
get to the safeties so both parties are

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
get to the safeties so both parties are

full bags job is to isolate on the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.609 
full bags job is to isolate on the
linebacker<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> create<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
linebacker and that's going to create a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
linebacker and that's going to create a
huge<00:01:41.189> hole<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.270> tail<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.689> right<00:01:42.869> here

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
huge hole for this tail back right here

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
huge hole for this tail back right here
to<00:01:43.229> shoot<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.009> sprint<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> goal

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to shoot it up and sprint to the goal

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
to shoot it up and sprint to the goal
line<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.450> especially<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.740> quarterback

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
line and especially when the quarterback

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
line and especially when the quarterback
makes<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> mess<00:01:48.000> point<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
makes the mess point right there it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.600 
makes the mess point right there it
gives<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> illusion<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> pass<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
gives the illusion of the pass and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.980 
gives the illusion of the pass and
everyone<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> take<00:01:51.659> their<00:01:51.810> natural

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
everyone is going to take their natural

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
everyone is going to take their natural
rush<00:01:52.590> lanes<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.490> why<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> lead<00:01:54.030> role<00:01:54.270> play

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
rush lanes that's why the lead role play

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
rush lanes that's why the lead role play
is<00:01:54.479> effective<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.290> why<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> opens<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
is effective and that's why I opens up a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.469 
is effective and that's why I opens up a
lot<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> end<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.360> going

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
lot you see right here the end is going

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
lot you see right here the end is going
to<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.320> area<00:01:58.500> backer<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
to take that that area backer the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370 
to take that that area backer the
tackles<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.600> take<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.780> area<00:02:01.079> this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
tackles going to take that area this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.749 
tackles going to take that area this
guy's<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> try<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> fight<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> control

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
guy's going to try to fight the control

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
guy's going to try to fight the control
on<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> scrimmage<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.659> end<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.930> usually

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
on the scrimmage the end is usually

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.480 
on the scrimmage the end is usually
going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> take<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> outside<00:02:05.040> backer<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
going to take the outside backer is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
going to take the outside backer is
going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> stay<00:02:06.270> stone<00:02:06.600> wall<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.079> their

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
going to stay stone wall with their

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380 
going to stay stone wall with their
tight<00:02:07.469> end<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.190> therefore<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> create<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> huge

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
tight end so therefore you create a huge

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.690 
tight end so therefore you create a huge
hole<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:10.080> fullback<00:02:10.979> should<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.459> able<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> get

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
hole that fullback should be able to get

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.850 
hole that fullback should be able to get
to<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.849> linebacker<00:02:12.090> with

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
to that linebacker with

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.340 
to that linebacker with
and<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:13.250> he<00:02:13.370> can<00:02:13.520> give<00:02:14.090> him<00:02:14.300> give<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> tailback

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
and if he can give him give the tailback

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.470 
and if he can give him give the tailback
a<00:02:15.410> two-way<00:02:15.920> go<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.610> tailback<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.180> either<00:02:17.360> go

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
a two-way go the tailback can either go

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.270 
a two-way go the tailback can either go
straight<00:02:17.780> up<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:18.530> hole<00:02:18.770> right<00:02:18.920> here<00:02:18.980> or

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
straight up is this hole right here or

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.220 
straight up is this hole right here or
he<00:02:19.460> can<00:02:19.580> shoot<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.600> way<00:02:20.750> depending<00:02:21.170> on

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
he can shoot to that way depending on

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.720 
he can shoot to that way depending on
which<00:02:21.350> way<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.530> linebackers<00:02:22.130> block<00:02:22.400> cuz<00:02:22.580> you
