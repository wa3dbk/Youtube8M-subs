it<00:00:21.689> doesn't<00:00:21.960> strike<00:00:22.140> me<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> team<00:00:22.619> that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
it doesn't strike me as a team that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to get a world title back then I think

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410 
to get a world title back then I think
they<00:00:28.710> understand<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.609> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> remember

what I achieved last year and I think
it's<00:00:32.880> good<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> remember<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.469> at<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's good to remember but it's at the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
it's good to remember but it's at the
point<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.190> need<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.370> cut<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
point you do need to cut off and you you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560 
point you do need to cut off and you you
got<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> move<00:00:36.989> forward<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.149> far<00:00:39.390> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
got to move forward but it's so far it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600

that<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> had<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:06.330> Braun<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.049> coming<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that you had at Braun and coming to this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
that you had at Braun and coming to this
is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.210> animal<00:01:09.750> look<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
is a very different animal look very

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
is a very different animal look very
different<00:01:10.170> feeling<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.220> before<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
different feeling when I before I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
different feeling when I before I
actually<00:01:12.330> came<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> table<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
actually came to the table like the so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.010 
actually came to the table like the so
we<00:01:14.340> decided<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.570> were<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.900> two

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we decided that we were going to be two

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.679 
we decided that we were going to be two
working<00:01:16.320> together<00:01:16.580> I'd<00:01:17.580> never<00:01:18.060> knew<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
working together I'd never knew what to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.770 
working together I'd never knew what to
expect<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.790> struggle<00:01:21.509> with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
expect and I think we will struggle with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.469 
expect and I think we will struggle with
chained<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> knew<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
chained to a little bit but I knew it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.200 
chained to a little bit but I knew it
was<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> real<00:01:25.439> challenge<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.000> far

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
was a real challenge for me but so far

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
was a real challenge for me but so far
the<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> spent<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.650> who's<00:01:28.829> being<00:01:29.009> been

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the time I spent see who's being been

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
the time I spent see who's being been
great<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.720> useful<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> we

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
great and the useful thing is that we

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.429 
great and the useful thing is that we
have<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> simulator<00:01:32.909> editing<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.229> means

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
have the simulator editing so it means

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.890 
have the simulator editing so it means
that<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.860> work<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.579> engineers<00:01:36.030> while

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that I can work with my engineers while

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.730 
that I can work with my engineers while
I'm<00:01:37.079> driving<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> simulator<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.740> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I'm driving the simulator so it's a you

it's<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.819> an<00:02:24.000> exciting<00:02:24.390> partnership<00:02:24.630> because

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
it's as an exciting partnership because

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.140 
it's as an exciting partnership because
I<00:02:25.230> think<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.620> he's<00:02:26.160> he's<00:02:26.700> gained<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> lot<00:02:27.090> of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
I think that he's he's gained a lot of

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.490 
I think that he's he's gained a lot of
experience<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.870> short<00:02:28.110> period<00:02:28.170> in

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
experience in this short period in

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.949 
experience in this short period in
Formula<00:02:28.830> One<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.610> my<00:02:29.849> negative<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
Formula One and so my negative and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.839 
Formula One and so my negative and
positive<00:02:31.140> experiences<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.160> both<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.430> us<00:02:32.549> and

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
positive experiences for both of us and

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.000 
positive experiences for both of us and
I<00:02:33.299> think<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.660> bring<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.959> together<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:34.650> be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
I think if we bring it together will be

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.130 
I think if we bring it together will be
a<00:02:35.190> much<00:02:35.370> stronger<00:02:35.670> package<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.780> season

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
a much stronger package to this season

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.229 
a much stronger package to this season
you<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:38.130> need<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.400> do<00:02:39.120> work

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
you know we really do need to do work

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
you know we really do need to do work
closely<00:02:39.569> together<00:02:39.870> Lewis<00:02:40.739> understands<00:02:41.190> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
closely together Lewis understands that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.690 
closely together Lewis understands that
as<00:02:41.489> well<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.420> yeah<00:02:43.230> we'll<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.700> close

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
as well so yeah we'll have a close

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
as well so yeah we'll have a close
relationship<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.660> really<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:46.769> will

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
relationship and really I think will

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370 
relationship and really I think will
work<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.459> same<00:02:47.670> direction<00:02:48.380> whatever

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
work in the same direction whatever

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.729 
work in the same direction whatever
happens<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.890> happens<00:02:51.019> but<00:02:52.019> first<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.560> we

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
happens it happens but first of all we

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.349 
happens it happens but first of all we
need<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.160> need<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> work<00:02:53.459> together<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.970> be

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
need to we need to work together to be

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.970 
need to we need to work together to be
competitive<00:02:54.720> there's<00:02:55.560> always<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.829> bit<00:02:55.950> of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
competitive there's always a bit of

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.600 
competitive there's always a bit of
competitive<00:02:56.549> frictional<00:02:57.090> isn't

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
competitive frictional isn't

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.240 
competitive frictional isn't
teen<00:02:57.790> drivers<00:02:58.720> well<00:02:59.290> yeah<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.710> was<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> little

teen drivers well yeah if I was a little

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.710 
teen drivers well yeah if I was a little
bit<00:03:00.370> between<00:03:00.580> yourself<00:03:01.060> from<00:03:01.240> Reubens<00:03:01.600> he'll

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
bit between yourself from Reubens he'll

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.350 
bit between yourself from Reubens he'll
certainly<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.200> between<00:03:02.470> lewis<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:03.940> fernando
