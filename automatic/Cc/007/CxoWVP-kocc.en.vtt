00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.650 
your scissors and make a very small slit
and<00:02:30.700> try<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.760> make<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.090> as<00:02:32.210> straight<00:02:32.510> as

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
and try to make it as straight as

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.770 
and try to make it as straight as
possible

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.380 

see<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.500> slit<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.820> very<00:02:43.090> very<00:02:43.360> small<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
see the slit it's very very small and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.150 
see the slit it's very very small and
straight<00:02:46.390> next<00:02:47.080> you're<00:02:47.200> gonna<00:02:47.350> cut<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
straight next you're gonna cut it the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.150 
straight next you're gonna cut it the
width<00:02:48.460> that<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.360> want<00:02:49.690> your<00:02:49.810> hole<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.320> make

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
width that you want your hole to be make

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.980 
width that you want your hole to be make
sure<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.580> can<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.120> do<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.390> as<00:02:52.510> straight<00:02:52.870> as

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
sure you can you do it as straight as

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.449 
sure you can you do it as straight as
possible<00:02:53.340> straight<00:02:54.340> up<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:57.220> null<00:02:57.370> so

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
possible straight up that the null so

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.310 
possible straight up that the null so
you're<00:02:57.550> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.730> put<00:02:58.540> your<00:02:58.660> scissors<00:02:58.990> in<00:02:59.200> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
hole like this way and cut outwards

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.640 
hole like this way and cut outwards
towards<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.959> coming<00:03:05.230> towards<00:03:05.470> me

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
into the white part because that's the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.790 
into the white part because that's the
thread<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.950> want<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.400> pull<00:04:24.610> out<00:04:25.800> so

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.560 

cut-out<00:04:38.650> it'll<00:04:39.430> make<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.700> easier<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.330> pull<00:04:40.540> the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
cut-out it'll make it easier to pull the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.149 
cut-out it'll make it easier to pull the
thread<00:04:40.900> out<00:04:41.170> as<00:04:41.380> well

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.089 

see<00:04:47.749> now<00:04:48.749> the<00:04:48.809> blue<00:04:49.110> part<00:04:49.409> is<00:04:49.469> shorter<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.009> we

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
see now the blue part is shorter and we

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.359 
see now the blue part is shorter and we
can<00:04:50.279> get<00:04:50.429> to<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.610> white<00:04:50.789> part<00:04:52.249> so<00:04:53.249> you're

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:53.369 
can get to the white part so you're

00:04:53.369 --> 00:05:00.139 
can get to the white part so you're
gonna<00:04:53.459> grab<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.330> very<00:04:54.539> first<00:04:55.199> thread<00:04:59.149> like

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:00.149 
gonna grab the very first thread like

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:05.209 
gonna grab the very first thread like
this<00:05:00.179> and<00:05:01.309> pull<00:05:02.309> it<00:05:02.459> out<00:05:03.589> it<00:05:04.589> should<00:05:04.649> go<00:05:05.039> all

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
this and pull it out it should go all

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:16.159 
this and pull it out it should go all
the<00:05:05.309> way<00:05:05.429> across<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:05.789> this

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.800 

the<00:05:20.830> harder<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.460> pull<00:05:21.790> on<00:05:21.970> them<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.450> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
the harder you pull on them and the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.090 
the harder you pull on them and the
further<00:05:23.140> it<00:05:23.380> goes<00:05:23.500> out<00:05:23.800> on<00:05:23.830> both<00:05:24.280> sides<00:05:24.640> is

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
further it goes out on both sides is

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.070 
further it goes out on both sides is
gonna<00:05:27.100> determine<00:05:27.520> how<00:05:27.970> big<00:05:28.180> your<00:05:28.450> your<00:05:28.810> hole

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
gonna determine how big your your hole

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.890 
gonna determine how big your your hole
is<00:05:29.460> I've<00:05:30.460> learned<00:05:30.760> that<00:05:30.970> once<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.420> start<00:05:31.720> to

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
is I've learned that once you start to

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.960 
is I've learned that once you start to
pull<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.440> little<00:05:32.830> less<00:05:33.070> on<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.550> sides<00:05:33.820> here

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
pull a little less on the sides here

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.620 
pull a little less on the sides here

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
because of all the extra frayed out

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.260 
because of all the extra frayed out
stuff<00:05:38.080> here<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:39.370> smaller<00:05:39.760> your<00:05:39.970> hole<00:05:40.240> is
