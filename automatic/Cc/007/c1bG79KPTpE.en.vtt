00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
outside and you know I've I've kind of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
outside and you know I've I've kind of
been<00:01:55.829> feeling<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.280> lately<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
been feeling that lately just a little

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.209 
been feeling that lately just a little
overwhelmed<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.259> guess<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.590> could<00:01:58.619> say<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
overwhelmed I guess you could say and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.580 
overwhelmed I guess you could say and
and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.060> needed<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.200> balance

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and I needed to kind of get my balance

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
and I needed to kind of get my balance
back<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.579> way<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> doing<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.360> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
back in my way of doing that is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
back in my way of doing that is
compensating<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.950> completely

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
compensating you know just completely

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.639 
compensating you know just completely
just<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.509> take<00:02:06.689> myself<00:02:06.899> away<00:02:07.200> from<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
just kind of take myself away from it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
just kind of take myself away from it
for<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.890> couple<00:02:08.039> days<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.729> relax<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.810> hang<00:02:09.989> out

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
for a couple days and relax and hang out

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.710 
for a couple days and relax and hang out
with<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.289> friends<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.800> shit<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
I think that's good to do every once in

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.600 
I think that's good to do every once in
a<00:02:14.240> while<00:02:14.390> because<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.840> kind<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.140> brings<00:02:15.890> I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
just trust me I've done it before the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.050 
just trust me I've done it before the
summer<00:03:08.000> um<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:10.040> into<00:03:10.250> my<00:03:10.370> senior<00:03:10.700> year<00:03:10.730> this

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
summer um going into my senior year this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.290 
summer um going into my senior year this
past<00:03:11.300> summer<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.750> did<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.850> completely

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
past summer I did it and it completely

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.860 
past summer I did it and it completely
just<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.709> was<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:15.950> start<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.870> Marie

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
just like that was the start of Marie

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.840 
just like that was the start of Marie
and<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.140> breaking<00:03:18.590> up<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.010> part<00:03:19.730> of

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
and I breaking up and I think part of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.479 
and I breaking up and I think part of
the<00:03:19.940> reason<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:21.530> happened<00:03:22.340> was

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
the reason that that happened was

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.610 
the reason that that happened was
because<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.820> was<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.810> call<00:03:24.140> duty<00:03:24.380> at

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
because I was so and to call duty at

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.990 
because I was so and to call duty at
YouTube<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.280> everything<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:27.940> don't<00:03:28.940> know

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
YouTube and everything and I don't know

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.790 
YouTube and everything and I don't know
I<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.660> think<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.320> good<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.530> have<00:03:30.739> a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
I just I think it's good to have a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.740 
I just I think it's good to have a
balance<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.820> kind<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.269> wanted<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.690> talk

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750

about<00:03:33.019> in<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.290> commentary<00:03:33.800> but<00:03:34.930> I'll<00:03:35.930> end<00:03:36.200> my

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
about in this commentary but I'll end my

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.009 
about in this commentary but I'll end my
little<00:03:36.709> rant<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.690> wanted<00:03:38.930> to
