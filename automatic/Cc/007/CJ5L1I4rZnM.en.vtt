shield portable device but it is a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
shield portable device but it is a

Tegra<00:00:30.330> note<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.779> do<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> shield<00:00:31.890> tablet

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
a comparison to the portable and the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
a comparison to the portable and the
note<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.770> why<00:00:37.950> would<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.190> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> spend

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
note so why would you want to spend
three<00:00:38.879> hundred<00:00:39.120> dollars<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:40.050> tablet<00:00:40.649> that

note is another envidia tablet which
pretty<00:02:40.840> much<00:02:40.930> does<00:02:41.560> exactly<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.489> same<00:02:42.519> thing

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
pretty much does exactly the same thing

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.149 
pretty much does exactly the same thing
that<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.450> shield<00:02:43.750> does<00:02:44.019> only<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.829> does<00:02:45.010> not

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
that the shield does only it does not

way<00:02:51.159> and<00:02:51.189> it<00:02:51.760> works<00:02:52.000> fine<00:02:52.980> another<00:02:53.980> reason<00:02:54.780> why

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
way and it works fine another reason why

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.869 
way and it works fine another reason why
you<00:02:55.840> wouldn't<00:02:56.349> want<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.310> get<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> shield<00:02:57.669> tablet

something similar to the shield from

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.870 
something similar to the shield from
nvidia<00:06:11.260> i<00:06:11.470> would<00:06:11.830> say<00:06:12.010> wait<00:06:12.280> there's<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.669> good

nvidia i would say wait there's a good
chance<00:06:13.120> there's<00:06:13.390> good<00:06:13.570> they're<00:06:13.840> gonna

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
release a shield portable too because

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.450 
release a shield portable too because
from<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.229> reaction<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:17.890> the<00:06:17.979> shield<00:06:18.220> tablet

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
from the reaction to the shield tablet

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.550 
from the reaction to the shield tablet
it's<00:06:18.820> been<00:06:19.030> pretty<00:06:19.210> negative<00:06:19.479> from<00:06:19.900> gamers<00:06:20.200> I

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
it's been pretty negative from gamers I

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.710 
it's been pretty negative from gamers I
mean<00:06:20.979> they've<00:06:21.160> aimed<00:06:21.460> towards<00:06:21.880> gamers<00:06:22.270> and<00:06:22.479> I

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
mean they've aimed towards gamers and I

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.170 
mean they've aimed towards gamers and I
don't<00:06:23.080> think<00:06:23.410> many<00:06:23.590> gamers<00:06:23.890> are<00:06:24.130> going<00:06:24.310> to<00:06:24.430> buy

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
don't think many gamers are going to buy

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.440 
don't think many gamers are going to buy
that<00:06:25.450> device<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:26.830> shield<00:06:27.070> portable<00:06:27.610> has<00:06:28.150> done

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
that device the shield portable has done

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.420 
that device the shield portable has done
well<00:06:28.750> I<00:06:29.020> think<00:06:29.110> for<00:06:29.740> the<00:06:29.770> most<00:06:29.979> part<00:06:30.100> for<00:06:30.400> a

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
well I think for the most part for a

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.150 
well I think for the most part for a
niche<00:06:30.700> audience<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.479> a<00:06:32.080> shoe<00:06:32.229> portable<00:06:32.680> to

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
niche audience and a shoe portable to

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.980 
niche audience and a shoe portable to
will<00:06:33.370> just<00:06:33.610> expand<00:06:34.060> that<00:06:34.180> audience<00:06:34.599> and<00:06:34.750> I

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
will just expand that audience and I

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.200 
will just expand that audience and I
think<00:06:35.289> that<00:06:35.410> would<00:06:35.500> be<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.710> much

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
think that would be a much

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.050 
think that would be a much
better<00:06:36.930> investment<00:06:37.620> for<00:06:37.770> nvidia<00:06:38.220> and<00:06:38.430> for<00:06:38.880> the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
better investment for nvidia and for the

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.629 
better investment for nvidia and for the
consumers<00:06:39.569> so<00:06:40.289> i<00:06:40.710> would<00:06:40.919> say<00:06:41.009> definitely<00:06:41.160> wait

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
consumers so i would say definitely wait

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.820 
consumers so i would say definitely wait
for<00:06:41.850> the<00:06:41.970> shield<00:06:42.180> portable<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.870> if<00:06:43.110> you<00:06:43.680> want

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
to tablet get a Tegra note that's pretty

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.230 
to tablet get a Tegra note that's pretty
much<00:06:45.900> the<00:06:45.960> same<00:06:46.199> thing<00:06:46.259> and<00:06:46.910> these<00:06:47.910> are<00:06:47.970> just

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
much the same thing and these are just

much the same thing and these are just
