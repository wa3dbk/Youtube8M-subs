00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 shit 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 the fight 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.730
 it's the weekend and to meet today for a new part 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.650
 commented serra mw 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.900
 as always in the regional 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 sure not live 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.200
 and I took my class full 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.810
 upset the media 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.560
 they can not do it and opposition forces a little pass of the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.890
 cross 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.010
 zack snyder in second language 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.840
 and so 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.980
 a short sentence requested to make parties 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.120
 general demers 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.260
 many stories 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.560
 so that I warn you that I do not want to do that described as strongly 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.690
 fallen 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 because it's a bit hard biting to do that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 but I'm still pretty well led 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.330
 mcdonald at first I had a little trouble actually it's true that the heir 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.910
 mass and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.380
 in particular particular about the truth 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 even unions 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.940
 twelve months 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.930
 I am engaged 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710
 go I think 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.270
 and then a man who was suffering 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.980
 this leading company in 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.420
 this year the city of amman 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.210
 this is my kids i'm going from the oncfs 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.730
 catch him after the fire 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.080
 come see them do it 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.560
 so you dreams of ethics even asked to do that and I would that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 I love by getting into trouble 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 it starts with a sprint final 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 sometimes it's a little hard anyway because the ideas of the insiders 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 really unbearable to watch the devil 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 I do not feel the talent elsewhere with his ensemble which is perfect 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.440
 So here we have to do with that's the community the activity is more 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.329
 serious 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.939
 we see the day to day by the troubles of French who are since 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.409
 his unbearable French who come 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.409
 lille who was then beaten this is true 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.899
 very popular and civilized 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.859
 all americans who are spending their time updating their status to actually 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.329
 Satisfactory this morning it's just a year 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.390
 it will be presented on September 23 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.459
 it's weird 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 seduces the great-motte launcher m 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.349
 neighborhood referent 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.749
 a good part of the diseases nevertheless 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.010
 he caught up with me I made a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.010
 angeliki movie 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.189
 jenna haze always harder to make a little movie because we are not supposed 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.079
 kill enemies 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.489
 evra 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.359
 It was three years ago 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.320
 alain lamassoure immensity lp worries and nice 14 she who took me 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.320
 a determination that knows 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.479
 m other thing look at her I'm ashamed after it's called xp w it's necessary that they 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.559
 knew m 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.689
 a friend who's role in the party 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.389
 he sees the stylist it's nice to play clip if I'm scared 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.379
 even if sometimes it misses a created with serge kampf 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.359
 it's a good little dedication for him 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.169
 m yes so let this party burst next to the subject 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.319
 because even though the exceptional course I will not wait 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.599
 pretty good part 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.639
 Why 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.639
 the military sector 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.129
 if you do not know what I think is the chain of the elect 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.659
 if ever I would not have the right to wonder if a private channel 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.529
 if the video but who ask why 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.400
 Francophones to send the meeting commented 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.949
 course ready 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.429
 it's really a 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.869
 but surely on his project and it works very well besides 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.789
 same time the venice theme 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.249
 while what to do 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.389
 and I really like this scene that I thought why not send them 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.239
 a gameplay that could be nice 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.299
 and I noticed that wade very very little gameplay where mingle 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.509
 the pro version 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.669
 a small job of 4 9% 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.039
 we see that it is where the fiction mixes 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.490
 so I thought 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.830
 these longest civil parties 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.289
 a gameplay the look what to do 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.889
 disposal then are you going to look for the tri-nations of the site 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.469
 scheduled in time 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:46.319
 according to the elysÃ©e m eight months how did you do that three sides 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 then during the funeral I am a little surprised 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.559
 I am very very happy 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.829
 thank you not even the first time it happens to me sometimes the 10th 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.129
 so here I wanted to thank but subscribers 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.839
 from day to day 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.229
 without confronting each other 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.979
 thank you all 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.979
 they follow me everywhere it's great fun 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.300
 know-how in engineering te 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:22.589
 once 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.360
 however I can not do 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.300
 very easily 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.080
 even during the summer holidays 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.080
 but I still carry 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.550
 kouacou djah because yes 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.550
 that me too for that it's a pleasure 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.809
 even if minimal on a name 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:54.169
 so it's really a big passion for me 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.040
 so 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.529
 and yes the artists towards something else 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.560
 m sometimes the person who asks me questions 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.490
 in fact 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.229
 I already have enough weird 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.839
 but these questions 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.509
 so recent activities do not know if you like 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.059
 recent activities 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.909
 we can shout something 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.650
 so that's a good way for me to 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.650
 to talk to you about telling you something without having to do 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.479
 that's why 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.150
 this is art in the city 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.610
 1 39 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.490
 picasso 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.669
 they were so infamous little comrades fallen for once 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:29.669
 score 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.669
 he was the subject Thursday in these women 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.949
 more than anything simple 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:36.969
 it looks like it's 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:38.669
 it was nice with me 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.969
 in Frankfurt your joint technical approach 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.639
 that's what I did not 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.639
 gifi% and at least two or three years 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.629
 flash may miss 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.240
 and I could have done a nudge study 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.399
 it's about 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.889
 out of 360 for France 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.229
 I let you savor it and I say thank you for having the soul this video and 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.589
 do not hesitate to 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.399
 and we'll see you soon 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.139
 I raised my voice
