state<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:50.070> would<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.280> never<00:00:50.550> predicted

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
state and you would have never predicted

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
state and you would have never predicted
that<00:00:51.180> species<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> middle<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> state

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that species in the middle of the state

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
that species in the middle of the state
but<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.899> those<00:00:55.649> kinds

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
but you know here it is so those kinds

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.670 
but you know here it is so those kinds
of<00:00:56.100> surprises<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:57.030> snowy<00:00:57.329> owl<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> rare

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of surprises a snowy owl which is a rare

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
of surprises a snowy owl which is a rare
animal<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.309> South<00:00:59.850> Carolina<00:01:00.059> ever<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.809> remember

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
animal in South Carolina ever I remember

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160 
animal in South Carolina ever I remember
seeing<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> fence<00:01:02.460> post<00:01:02.690> out<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.960> way

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
seeing it on a fence post out this way

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
seeing it on a fence post out this way
back<00:01:04.530> years<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.070> years<00:01:05.189> ago<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> was

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
back years and years ago I think it was

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
back years and years ago I think it was
even<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> 60s<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> saw<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.560> 70

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
even in the 60s when I saw that or 70

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.359 
even in the 60s when I saw that or 70
some<00:01:08.630> great<00:01:09.630> variety<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> habitats<00:01:10.619> we've

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
some great variety of habitats we've

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.060 
some great variety of habitats we've
never<00:01:11.520> looked<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.939> closely<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.540> should<00:01:13.070> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
never looked as closely as we should so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.890 
never looked as closely as we should so
this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> great<00:01:14.790> opportunity<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.509> really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
this is a great opportunity to really

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.140 
this is a great opportunity to really
look<00:01:16.409> closely<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> biodiversity<00:01:17.520> here

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
look closely at the biodiversity here

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
look closely at the biodiversity here
and<00:01:18.330> we're<00:01:19.170> already<00:01:19.350> surprised<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.340> we

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and we're already surprised by what we

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
and we're already surprised by what we
see<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.820> prediction<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.720> more

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
see my prediction is will be more

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
see my prediction is will be more
surprised<00:01:22.259> than<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.040> history

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
surprised than when we look at history

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.070 
surprised than when we look at history

plants<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.650> animals<00:01:57.010> which<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.280> fun<00:01:57.490> enough

for<00:01:58.000> me<00:01:58.120> but<00:01:58.990> connections<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.760> me<00:02:00.880> that's<00:02:01.090> the

for me but connections to me that's the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.970 
for me but connections to me that's the
most<00:02:01.300> important<00:02:01.960> thing<00:02:01.990> maybe<00:02:02.380> that's<00:02:02.710> the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
really all about it's reminding us we
