quick way to what you want to find out

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
quick way to what you want to find out
the<00:00:15.990> cardiac<00:00:16.500> excess<00:00:18.080> cardiac<00:00:19.080> axis<00:00:20.330> okay

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the cardiac excess cardiac axis okay

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.470 
the cardiac excess cardiac axis okay
what's<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> easiest<00:00:22.529> way<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.400> find<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.240> what

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
what's the easiest way to find out what

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.189 
what's the easiest way to find out what
you<00:00:24.600> call<00:00:24.750> cardiac<00:00:25.230> excess<00:00:25.650> okay<00:00:26.039> guys<00:00:27.199> why

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
you call cardiac excess okay guys why

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.689 
you call cardiac excess okay guys why
it's<00:00:28.410> important<00:00:28.949> why<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.099> should<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it's important why we should know the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.389 
it's important why we should know the
cardiac<00:00:30.119> exists<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:31.529> there<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
cardiac exists because if there is a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.370 
cardiac exists because if there is a
change<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> cardiac<00:00:33.420> excess<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.230> are

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
change in the cardiac excess that are

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.310 
change in the cardiac excess that are
what<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.010> call<00:00:35.480> causes<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
what we call causes for that and you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
what we call causes for that and you
have<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> find<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> cause<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.760> have

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
have to find it the cause and you have

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
have to find it the cause and you have
to<00:00:39.030> treat<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> treatment<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.170> different

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
to treat and the treatment is different

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.520 
to treat and the treatment is different
for<00:00:41.160> each<00:00:41.340> cause<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.480> cardiac<00:00:43.050> excess

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
for each cause for that cardiac excess

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.130 
for each cause for that cardiac excess
deviation<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.600> well<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
deviation so you know very well the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
deviation so you know very well the
contact<00:00:46.530> exists<00:00:46.920> either<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.760> left

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
contact exists either it can be a left

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.260 
contact exists either it can be a left
axis<00:00:48.420> deviation<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.469> axis<00:00:49.950> deviation

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
axis deviation or a right axis deviation

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.619 
axis deviation or a right axis deviation
okay<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> let's<00:00:52.590> start<00:00:53.270> first<00:00:54.270> let<00:00:54.510> me<00:00:54.660> draw

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
okay so let's start first let me draw

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.030 
okay so let's start first let me draw
diagram<00:00:57.629> heart

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.620 

if<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> heart<00:01:03.300> okay<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
if this is a heart okay so you know this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.460 
if this is a heart okay so you know this
is<00:01:06.780> lead<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:12.119> looks<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.990> angle

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
is lead one that looks at this angle

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.940 
is lead one that looks at this angle
okay<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.600> lead<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.170> over<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:20.750> okay<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
okay and it lead to over here okay so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
okay and it lead to over here okay so
remember<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.400> gonna<00:01:23.550> talk<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:24.119> this

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
remember I'm gonna talk about this

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
remember I'm gonna talk about this
cardiac<00:01:25.320> axis<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> diagnose<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cardiac axis you have to diagnose a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.300 
cardiac axis you have to diagnose a
contact<00:01:27.360> axis<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.050> fast<00:01:28.410> with<00:01:28.830> these<00:01:29.070> two

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
contact axis very fast with these two

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.810 
contact axis very fast with these two
leads<00:01:29.550> lead<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> lead<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> other

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
leads lead one and the lead to the other

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.950 
leads lead one and the lead to the other
thing<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.390> require<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> QRS<00:01:34.619> complex

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
thing what we require is the QRS complex

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.430 
thing what we require is the QRS complex
QRS<00:01:37.009> complex<00:01:40.399> so<00:01:41.399> if<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.000> QRS<00:01:42.420> complex<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
QRS complex so if the QRS complex in the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.350 
QRS complex so if the QRS complex in the
lead<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> lead<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> dis

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
lead one in the lead one in the dis

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.920 
lead one in the lead one in the dis
league<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.250> predominantly<00:01:47.250> positive

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
league one is predominantly positive

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.010 
league one is predominantly positive
okay<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.440> it's<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.770> past<00:01:50.070> unit<00:01:50.490> lead<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:51.020> means

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
okay if it's a past unit lead one means

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.639 
okay if it's a past unit lead one means
if<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.979> lies<00:01:53.460> between<00:01:55.190> let<00:01:56.190> me<00:01:56.369> draw<00:01:56.640> over<00:01:56.910> here

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
if it lies between let me draw over here

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.460 
if it lies between let me draw over here
the<00:01:58.649> axis<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.899> angles<00:02:04.350> are

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
the axis this is what the angles are

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.410 
the axis this is what the angles are
drawing<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.000> plus<00:02:06.509> 90<00:02:07.340> okay<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> this

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
drawing this is plus 90 okay and this

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.199 
drawing this is plus 90 okay and this
comes<00:02:10.430> zero<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.819> comes

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
comes zero and this here it comes

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.180 
comes zero and this here it comes
minus<00:02:15.810> minus<00:02:16.680> 19<00:02:18.260> okay<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.650> here<00:02:20.069> it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
minus minus 19 okay and this here it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.809 
minus minus 19 okay and this here it
comes

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
comes

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.800 
comes
plus<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:21.989> minus<00:02:22.020> 180<00:02:23.630> okay

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
plus or minus 180 okay

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.170 
plus or minus 180 okay
so<00:02:25.770> lead<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.370> will<00:02:26.760> look<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
so lead one will look at the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.820 
so lead one will look at the
perpendicular<00:02:27.900> which<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.590> draw<00:02:28.770> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
perpendicular which if you draw the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
perpendicular which if you draw the
perpendicular<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.670> lead<00:02:29.819> one<00:02:30.030> means<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
perpendicular to the lead one means it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.040 
perpendicular to the lead one means it
looks<00:02:31.200> around<00:02:31.709> minus<00:02:32.580> 90<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.209> plus<00:02:33.330> 90<00:02:34.069> okay

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
looks around minus 90 to plus 90 okay

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.680 
looks around minus 90 to plus 90 okay
remember<00:02:37.050> if<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.130> QRS<00:02:38.550> complex<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.510> lead

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
remember if the QRS complex in the lead

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.199 
remember if the QRS complex in the lead
one<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.110> predominantly<00:02:40.890> positive<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
one is predominantly positive this

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.660 
one is predominantly positive this
indicates<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.930> excess<00:02:43.770> lies<00:02:44.069> anywhere

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
indicates that excess lies anywhere

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.970 
indicates that excess lies anywhere
between<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.300> -<00:02:45.540> 90<00:02:46.080> -<00:02:46.739> 90<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.730> plus<00:02:47.970> 90

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
between the - 90 - 90 and the plus 90

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.120 
say the excess is normal you have to
look<00:04:57.740> at<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.099> lead<00:04:58.280> one<00:04:58.639> lead<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.960> lead<00:05:00.830> one

look at the lead one lead to lead one

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.620 
look at the lead one lead to lead one
lead<00:05:01.639> to<00:05:01.909> okay

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
lead to okay

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.439

and in both illegal lead one and two

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:06.490 
and in both illegal lead one and two
both<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.110> leads

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
both the leads

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.680 
both the leads

if the QRS complex is predominantly
positive<00:05:09.020> then<00:05:09.919> it<00:05:10.099> means<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.490> axis<00:05:10.909> is

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
positive then it means the axis is

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.959 
positive then it means the axis is
normal<00:05:11.770> okay

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
normal okay

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.879 
normal okay
let's<00:05:13.969> see<00:05:14.180> whether<00:05:14.539> it's<00:05:14.780> left<00:05:15.409> axis

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
let's see whether it's left axis

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.390 
let's see whether it's left axis
deviation<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.080> have<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.740> say<00:05:18.919> the
