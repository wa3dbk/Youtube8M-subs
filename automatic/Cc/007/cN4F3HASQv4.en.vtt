00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 that is now you can see it looks like this 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.980
 then it out 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.159

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.220
 Daniel select the route and again 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 to move the focus 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.850
 there you can put a text below 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.799
 advised and that is red 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 Now you just have to reboots 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.689
 Press system again by button 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.479
 would have to press the medium just dry 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.600
 and so kept their now here we are in 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.119
 menu and here is a new app 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.549
 the superuser turned up with 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.400
 this app is just a lot of files 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.790
 or many possibilities 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.829
 unlocked 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 This app was in is in the breed 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.549
 keep score and therefore will 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 automatically installed on the phone yes 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.020
 and if now wanted to perform action 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.490
 like for example apps delete the directly 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.060
 are already out at the installation 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.240
 such as which to the computer 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.860
 and who can delete it now 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.439
 simply use a program that is 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.469
 hÃ¤ndel backups we open the times 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.560
 it also in place in google places and 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.530
 here it is briefly discreetly checked 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.660
 it is that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.900
 then crashes but that is not 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.360
 bad and then no messages 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.970
 is superuser request and has it 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.410
 asked if this program action 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.640
 the stop may over 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.490
 root rights work 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.680
 presses me and then notice that 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.200
 means that it is always allowed and now 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.250
 we may want to do things or others 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.940
 actor feeling first we go to the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.160
 bottom left on the button proven button 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.000
 and then go on stack and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.560
 processing 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.080
 There are many here now 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.230
 carry out things such as Beck 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.280
 to identify individual programs of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.810
 of all programs or then 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.000
 we can restore things and 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.739
 we can paste that in different 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.160
 such as files or apps the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.890
 be on the phone only on the s 10 o'clock 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.940
 We can not let it out of it 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.670
 do the sd card 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.550
 over it can deactivate like raps 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.830
 manipulate data month or things 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.540
 just uninstall that 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.450
 installed press on go you can 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.489
 just pick any I like 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.019
 but would not recommend because there is 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.600
 apps do not delete the people like to 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.820
 For example, the calls you can do 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.900
 it just pushes in the river here 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.250
 things then by him yes so is red 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.070
 that is the sense to suspect 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.989
 I hope you like the video though 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.989

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.430
 has worked or not
