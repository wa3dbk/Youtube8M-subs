BR G when we did SP v2 we wanted to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.519 
BR G when we did SP v2 we wanted to
balance<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.180> out<00:00:27.240> against<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> carbine<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
BR G and M my 5k with was then cut what

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
BR G and M my 5k with was then cut what
we<00:00:32.520> basically<00:00:32.700> did<00:00:33.120> was<00:00:33.390> removed<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> scope

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
we basically did was removed the scope

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.069 
we basically did was removed the scope
gave<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> laser<00:00:34.920> pointer<00:00:35.750> gave<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> an<00:00:36.930> 8

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
gave it a laser pointer gave it an 8

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.889 
gave it a laser pointer gave it an 8
round<00:00:37.350> clip<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> left<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> stock

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899

round clip and left it with the stock
Caleb<00:00:40.260> when<00:00:40.379> settings<00:00:40.800> other<00:00:40.920> than<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> now

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
Caleb when settings other than that now

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.090 
Caleb when settings other than that now
the<00:00:42.059> problem<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.680> became

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the problem with that was it just became

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.430 
the problem with that was it just became
a<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:44.730> monotonous<00:00:45.120> weapon<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> use<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a very monotonous weapon to use it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
a very monotonous weapon to use it
didn't<00:00:46.710> matter<00:00:46.860> how<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> used<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
didn't matter how it used it you just

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.720 
didn't matter how it used it you just
fired<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.320> fired<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.620> again<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> didn't

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
fired it you fired it again and didn't

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.590 
fired it you fired it again and didn't
lose<00:00:50.850> accuracy<00:00:51.860> now<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.070> SP<00:00:53.370> v3<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.210> thing<00:00:54.449> we

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
lose accuracy now for SP v3 one thing we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.729 
lose accuracy now for SP v3 one thing we
really<00:00:55.020> wanted<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.500> pistol<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> scope

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
really wanted our pistol was the scope

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
really wanted our pistol was the scope
everyone's<00:00:58.739> favorite<00:00:59.219> pistol<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.789> pretty

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
everyone's favorite pistol is pretty

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
everyone's favorite pistol is pretty
much<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> halo<00:01:00.510> 1<00:01:00.780> pistol<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.440> ODST<00:01:01.859> pistol

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
much the halo 1 pistol the ODST pistol

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
much the halo 1 pistol the ODST pistol
or<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.969> halo<00:01:03.239> reach<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.809> war<00:01:03.989> halo<00:01:04.229> 4<00:01:04.530> pistol

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
or the halo reach and war halo 4 pistol

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.219 
or the halo reach and war halo 4 pistol
and<00:01:05.299> reason<00:01:06.299> why<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> scope

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and reason why is because of the scope

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
and reason why is because of the scope
now<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.460> added<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> scope<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> gave

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
now we added the scope back and it gave

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.130 
now we added the scope back and it gave
the<00:01:09.990> Nate<00:01:10.200> round<00:01:10.470> clip<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.840> you're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the Nate round clip when if you're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
the Nate round clip when if you're
zoomed<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.710> what's<00:01:13.950> unique<00:01:14.220> about<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> pistol

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
zoomed in what's unique about the pistol

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640 
zoomed in what's unique about the pistol
is<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.150> locks<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> rate<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> fire<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
is that it locks the rate of fire so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
is that it locks the rate of fire so
it's<00:01:16.799> identical<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> halo<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.880> pistol<00:01:18.330> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it's identical to the halo and pistol so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's identical to the halo and pistol so
if<00:01:19.350> you're<00:01:19.590> playing<00:01:19.770> Halo<00:01:20.159> seee<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.970> probably

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
if you're playing Halo seee you probably

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.969 
if you're playing Halo seee you probably
like<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> halo<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.020> pistol<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
like the halo and pistol and when you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
like the halo and pistol and when you
zoom<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> same<00:01:24.030> experience<00:01:24.210> with

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
zoom in you get the same experience with

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.580 
zoom in you get the same experience with
a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.500> accuracy<00:01:26.689> now<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.320> really

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a little bit more accuracy now we really

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280 
a little bit more accuracy now we really
pictured<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> pistol<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> sidearm<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.930> in

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
pictured the pistol as a sidearm as in

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
pictured the pistol as a sidearm as in
that<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.490> weapon<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.030> always

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that it's the one weapon you can always

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.359 
that it's the one weapon you can always
fall<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.799> options<00:01:35.250> are

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
fall back on when your other options are

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.420 
fall back on when your other options are
exhausted<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.119> four<00:01:37.049> weapon<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
exhausted and four weapon to have that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
exhausted and four weapon to have that
role<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> game<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.420> needed<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
role in the game it really needed a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.679 
role in the game it really needed a
scope<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.520> plenty<00:01:41.880> powerful<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.570> can

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
scope and it's plenty powerful you can

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.359 
scope and it's plenty powerful you can
take<00:01:42.899> down<00:01:43.049> pretty<00:01:43.409> much<00:01:43.530> any<00:01:43.740> unit<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
take down pretty much any unit with it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
take down pretty much any unit with it
with<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> bit<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> skill<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:46.380> zoom<00:01:46.740> allows<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
with a bit of skill the zoom allows it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
with a bit of skill the zoom allows it
