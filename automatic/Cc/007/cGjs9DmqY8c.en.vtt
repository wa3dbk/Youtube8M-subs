you<00:03:28.380> might<00:03:28.530> have<00:03:28.650> noticed<00:03:28.680> yourself<00:03:29.310> are

you might have noticed yourself are

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
trying to run away from a Santos

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.960 
trying to run away from a Santos
swooping<00:03:31.590> down<00:03:31.620> or<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.070> pounce<00:03:32.459> from<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.760> river

swooping down or a pounce from a river

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.120 
swooping down or a pounce from a river
is<00:03:33.239> pretty<00:03:33.690> useless<00:03:34.019> at<00:03:34.320> majority<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.920> time

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
is pretty useless at majority of a time

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.000 
is pretty useless at majority of a time
so<00:03:36.060> next<00:03:36.450> time<00:03:36.690> try<00:03:37.109> rolling<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.680> side

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010

so next time try rolling to the side
instead<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.819> think<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.420> will<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.660> pleasantly

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.690 

there<00:03:44.140> then<00:03:44.350> comes<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.770> question<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.400> whether

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
there then comes a question of whether

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.550 
there then comes a question of whether
the<00:03:45.850> whole<00:03:46.150> ground<00:03:46.480> as<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> human<00:03:47.080> or<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.410> keep

moving around the map from location to

moving around the map from location to
location<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:51.190> really<00:03:51.610> depends<00:03:52.150> on<00:03:52.300> the
