00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it we're going to use the edge of this

it we're going to use the edge of this
box<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> fold<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
box and then I'm going to fold on this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.530 
box and then I'm going to fold on this
edge<00:01:19.220> start<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> middle<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.090> hand<00:01:21.360> goes

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
edge start in the middle one hand goes

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
edge start in the middle one hand goes
to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.470> hand<00:01:22.740> goes<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> left

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to the right one hand goes to the left

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
to the right one hand goes to the left
we're<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> cut<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.229> more

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
we're going to cut off a little bit more

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.310 
we're going to cut off a little bit more
of<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> paper<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.930> bit<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.140> out

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of this paper this little bit it's out

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.899 
of this paper this little bit it's out
of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> way<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> lot<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> deal

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
of the way we don't have a lot to deal

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.390 
of the way we don't have a lot to deal
with<00:01:30.170> now<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> haven't<00:01:32.250> cut

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
with now you can see that I haven't cut

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.920 
with now you can see that I haven't cut
this<00:01:32.549> straight<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.509> doesn't<00:01:33.840> matter

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this straight but that doesn't matter

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.649 
this straight but that doesn't matter
because<00:01:34.140> once<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.979> tape<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.299> we're

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
because once we tape this down we're

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
because once we tape this down we're
going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> use<00:01:37.049> double-sided<00:01:37.500> tape<00:01:38.420> three

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
going to use double-sided tape three

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.130 
going to use double-sided tape three
pieces<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> tape<00:01:40.200> again<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.899> we're<00:01:43.049> going

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pieces of tape again and now we're going

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
pieces of tape again and now we're going
to<00:01:43.229> put<00:01:43.409> double-sided<00:01:43.979> tape<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.750> we're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to put double-sided tape down we're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.100 
to put double-sided tape down we're
going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> put<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.100> edge

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
going to put it right here on this edge

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
going to put it right here on this edge
because<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.439> pull<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.740> paper<00:01:50.540> we<00:01:51.540> want

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because when we pull the paper we want

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.950 
because when we pull the paper we want
it<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.049> land<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.189> edge<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> there's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it to land right on the edge so there's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
it to land right on the edge so there's
our<00:01:55.140> edge<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> end

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
our edge now we're going to do the end

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.580 
our edge now we're going to do the end
so<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.469> fold<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> side<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:01.229> hold<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so you fold in the side and you hold the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580 
so you fold in the side and you hold the
paper<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.299> tight<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.049> box<00:02:04.259> as

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
paper and get it as tight to the box as

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.959 
paper and get it as tight to the box as
you<00:02:04.710> possibly<00:02:05.280> can

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you possibly can

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.960 
you possibly can
and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:07.409> fold<00:02:08.009> this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and then fold this

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.960 
and then fold this
and<00:02:09.150> make<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> triangle<00:02:10.110> with<00:02:10.320> it<00:02:10.730> this<00:02:11.730> edge

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and make a triangle with it this edge

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.260 
and make a triangle with it this edge
goes<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.920> we're<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.280> root<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
goes down we're going to get a root of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.630 
goes down we're going to get a root of
little<00:02:15.600> extra<00:02:15.870> paper<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.770> we're<00:02:17.550> going

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
little extra paper here so we're going

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.190 
little extra paper here so we're going
to<00:02:17.700> cut<00:02:17.970> above<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.300> line<00:02:18.600> about<00:02:18.930> an<00:02:19.050> eighth

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
to cut above the line about an eighth

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.720 
to cut above the line about an eighth
one<00:02:19.470> inch<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> important<00:02:22.170> part<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:23.010> we

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
one inch the important part is that we

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.410 
one inch the important part is that we
need<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.600> get<00:02:25.290> some<00:02:25.530> tape<00:02:25.770> here<00:02:26.000> tape<00:02:27.000> paper

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
need to get some tape here tape paper

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.360 
need to get some tape here tape paper
the<00:02:27.720> paper<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.820> last<00:02:30.030> edge<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:31.020> here

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
the paper and the last edge right here

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.820 
the paper and the last edge right here
fold<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:33.470> double-sided<00:02:34.470> tape<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.830> there

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
fold it down double-sided tape and there

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.860 
fold it down double-sided tape and there
you<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.370> edge<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.300> look<00:02:39.510> at<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you have the edge so if you look at the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.990 
you have the edge so if you look at the
end<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.560> look<00:02:40.740> at<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> side<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.760> nice

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
end and you look at the side it's a nice

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.450 
end and you look at the side it's a nice
folded<00:02:42.720> side<00:02:42.990> there's<00:02:43.740> no<00:02:43.920> tape<00:02:44.190> showing

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
folded side there's no tape showing

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.090 
folded side there's no tape showing
because<00:02:44.790> we've<00:02:45.150> used<00:02:45.450> double-sided<00:02:45.810> tape<00:02:46.440> so

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
because we've used double-sided tape so

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.680 
because we've used double-sided tape so
here's<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.550> holiday<00:02:48.000> wrapping<00:02:48.510> and
