00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.509 
own show vehicle this was found here in
town<00:00:22.519> got<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> reasonable<00:00:24.060> price<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:25.519> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
town got for a reasonable price but it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.300 
town got for a reasonable price but it
needs<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.510> fair<00:00:27.900> bit<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> work<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.619> lot<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.039> things

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
needs a fair bit of work a lot of things

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.099 
needs a fair bit of work a lot of things
that<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> subtle<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.929> most

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that are just kind of subtle that most

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.659 
that are just kind of subtle that most
people<00:00:31.349> don't<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.890> take<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> time<00:00:32.340> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
people don't really take the time to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.389 
people don't really take the time to
take<00:00:33.329> care<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.780> such<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> door<00:00:34.829> line<00:00:35.040> here

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
take care of such as the door line here

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.660 
take care of such as the door line here
you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.770> seam<00:00:37.770> doesn't<00:00:38.129> fit<00:00:38.640> very

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you can see the seam doesn't fit very

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.610 
you can see the seam doesn't fit very
well<00:00:39.440> but<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.920> don't<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.700> too<00:00:42.090> big<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> problem

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
well but I don't be too big of a problem

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.900 
well but I don't be too big of a problem
and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> based<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> VW<00:00:47.489> chassis

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and then it is based on the VW chassis

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.110 
and then it is based on the VW chassis
so<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.110> ahead<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.120> bolt

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
so we're going to go ahead and bolt

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.170 
so we're going to go ahead and bolt
right<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:52.110> cost<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.649> nine<00:00:53.550> inch<00:00:53.850> with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
right in with our cost of nine inch with

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.410 
right in with our cost of nine inch with
the<00:00:54.420> rebirth<00:00:55.289> auto<00:00:55.969> adapter<00:00:56.969> plate<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> I'll

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the rebirth auto adapter plate and I'll

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.299 
the rebirth auto adapter plate and I'll
just<00:00:57.600> bolt<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.730> real<00:00:59.730> easy<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
just bolt right in real easy and

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.240 
just bolt right in real easy and
figuring<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> putting<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.510> battery<00:01:03.870> pack

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
figuring on putting the battery pack

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.780 
figuring on putting the battery pack
right<00:01:05.250> behind<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.439> seats<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:08.010> front<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
right behind the seats in front of that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.100 
right behind the seats in front of that
rear<00:01:09.180> deck<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> essentially<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.150> mass

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
rear deck to put it essentially the mass

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.130 
rear deck to put it essentially the mass
of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.920> batteries<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of the batteries right here on the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.429 
of the batteries right here on the
chassis<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:18.390> rear<00:01:19.170> heavy

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
chassis which will be a bit rear heavy

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.800 
chassis which will be a bit rear heavy
but<00:01:20.810> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.810> today

wheels off take a look at the brakes
make<00:01:34.140> sure<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.470> real<00:01:34.680> good<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> go

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
make sure there's real good to go

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.340 
make sure there's real good to go
these<00:01:36.630> wheels<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.610> old-style<00:01:39.350> universal

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
these wheels are the old-style universal

these wheels are the old-style universal
whip<00:01:40.590> rims<00:01:41.509> they<00:01:42.509> use<00:01:42.750> these<00:01:44.060> adapter<00:01:45.060> rings

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
whip rims they use these adapter rings

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.080

to<00:01:46.740> bolt<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> variety<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.720> diameter<00:01:50.090> bolt

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to bolt on to a variety of diameter bolt

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.560 
to bolt on to a variety of diameter bolt
patterns<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:53.149> they're<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.329> good

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
patterns and you can see they're so good

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.959 
patterns and you can see they're so good
that<00:01:54.720> one's<00:01:54.899> already<00:01:55.200> missing<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.820> what

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that one's already missing and what

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700 
that one's already missing and what
happens<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.869> these<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.320> washers

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
happens is you get these little washers

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.260 
happens is you get these little washers
and<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.399> soon<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> actually<00:01:59.939> tighten<00:02:00.180> them

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and as soon as you actually tighten them

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.740 
and as soon as you actually tighten them
down

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
down

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
down
they<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:02.009> deformed<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.149> start

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
they get deformed and then they start

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.999 
they get deformed and then they start
getting<00:02:03.659> loose<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.200> fall<00:02:04.409> off<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
getting loose and they fall off and the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.459 
getting loose and they fall off and the
wheel<00:02:05.159> falls<00:02:05.460> off<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.969> bad<00:02:06.090> things<00:02:06.360> happen<00:02:06.479> so

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
wheel falls off and bad things happen so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
wheel falls off and bad things happen so
we<00:02:07.619> are<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.580> keeping<00:02:08.849> these<00:02:09.060> at

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
we are not going to be keeping these at

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.520 
we are not going to be keeping these at
all

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
all

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.600

consider<00:02:11.100> them<00:02:11.310> gone<00:02:13.130> we're<00:02:14.130> gonna<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.430> with

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
consider them gone we're gonna go with

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.630 
consider them gone we're gonna go with
some<00:02:15.150> low<00:02:15.360> rolling<00:02:15.630> resistance<00:02:16.340> rubber<00:02:17.340> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
some low rolling resistance rubber on

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
some low rolling resistance rubber on
the<00:02:17.820> new<00:02:17.970> rims<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.960> way<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the new rims so that way we can get the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
the new rims so that way we can get the
most<00:02:19.800> efficiency<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.790> our<00:02:20.940> drivetrain

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
most efficiency out of our drivetrain

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.290 
most efficiency out of our drivetrain
but<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.320> brief<00:02:25.530> walk<00:02:25.830> around<00:02:26.300> you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
but that is the brief walk around you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.970

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
windshield is custom to this car they

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.199 
windshield is custom to this car they
weren't<00:03:13.500> very<00:03:13.530> many<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.890> them<00:03:14.010> made<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.180> lot

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
weren't very many of them made and a lot

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.150 
weren't very many of them made and a lot
of<00:03:15.450> them<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.630> are<00:03:15.690> still<00:03:15.959> around<00:03:16.290> have

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
of them that are still around have

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.090 
of them that are still around have
cracks<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.450> does<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.739> so

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
cracks just like this one does and so

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.690 
cracks just like this one does and so
we're<00:03:20.250> gonna<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.700> figure<00:03:21.330> something<00:03:21.450> out

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
we're gonna have to figure something out

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.120 
we're gonna have to figure something out
since<00:03:23.700> they<00:03:23.850> do<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:24.150> make<00:03:24.300> them<00:03:24.480> right<00:03:24.660> now

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
since they do not make them right now

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.580 
since they do not make them right now
but<00:03:26.130> first<00:03:27.060> things<00:03:27.269> first<00:03:27.330> making<00:03:28.260> sure<00:03:28.410> it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
but first things first making sure it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.130 
but first things first making sure it
actually<00:03:28.709> drives<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.489> then<00:03:30.060> making<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.900> drive

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
actually drives and then making it drive

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.460 
actually drives and then making it drive
