00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.469
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.690
 to bring the dotcom running review today 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.980
 let's analyze the new balance mt 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.980
 version 2 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.789
 and you have them as you can see they are 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.579
 minimalist sneakers 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.399
 and the revised version in this case the 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.560
 version 2 of what we could say a 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.989
 classic the new balance mt 10 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.780
 let's start seeing the sole as 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.360
 you see a sole 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.899
 based on fixed hexagons as the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.450
 areas these blue are from the house vibrate 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.330
 therefore house rubber vibrate 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.430
 because hexagons so to favor a 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.250
 rhyme is multidirectional in any 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.130
 fixed direction that moves your fingers 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.890
 to find some taco that 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.450
 that I stopped watching also the zones 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 where it wears out most is in the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.729
 sneaker look how the sole goes up here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.460
 in the lateral parts it also goes up 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.049
 hours these side parts more for 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 hold the foot while this 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.100
 front to protect us from also from 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 the fixed stones that there are more pretty 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.229
 more material because in other 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 minimalist sneakers and this is going to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.140
 favor first in the protection of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.149
 foot and then the durability of the sole 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.549
 let's flex the ones you see are 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.080
 logically very easy since they are the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.050
 minimalist sneakers but yes that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.330
 see how they have enough return and 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.250
 This is because in this model 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.970
 mtv2 this little one has been introduced 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.430
 midsole 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.180
 look here this little midsole that 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.380
 Damping the shoe the fall 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.150
 also novelty has been defined of 4 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.960
 millimeters from backward therefore 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.260
 a drop of 4 millimeters from the back to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.170
 ahead therefore the cushioning and 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.860
 a small drop let's see now the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.930
 upper fixed as now if the shoe 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.300
 meets all minimalist requirements 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.070
 and is that practically a fabric 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.070
 bored although percent carries a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.150
 finer telita but little more a part 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.810
 more all this part of here something more more 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.030
 dense to protect us from the foot and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.240
 part this central 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.970
 an area already much more like skin 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.209
 synthetic to give consistency to the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.610
 Sneaker and to catch the foot fixed 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.160
 that the laces run quite well 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.040
 they are pretty flat semi-cords 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.010
 long and quite the truth quite 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.110
 little minimalists here has us 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.140
 surprised a little and wallace the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.970
 totally minimalist tongue tied to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.590
 the upper area has to be said that it is 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.260
 an antibacterial tissue 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.750
 that you can practically many people 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.319
 he carries them even he must some 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.040
 way to wear without a sock 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.000
 incorporates template 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.430
 and the interior is 0 seams here what 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.829
 you can see in yellow, look how it runs 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.170
 up to inside the shoe with 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.069
 zero coastal with both a finish 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.099
 exceptional part of the heel as you see 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.670
 It incorporates this area also of skin 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.609
 synthetic this gives consistency to the heel 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.260
 notice that it has no chassis but that 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.260
 gives consistency because when you put your foot 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.260
 the tissue is tensed and this part of here 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.180
 is what holds a little to the foot giving 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.840
 consistency to the shoe holding 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.920
 at the foot holding it and making the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.380
 perfectly fitted shoe 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.370
 around the foot set here as 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.040
 there is also an extra fabric for the heel 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.340
 and this is also going to make you grip 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.860
 also our achilles tendon 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.959
 in this back part you fix for 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.389
 help us is a detail that in other 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.340
 Sneakers could be less important 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.550
 but in these minimalists a good 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.040
 detail the shooter to reach us the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.810
 because it's not so obvious to put on 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.690
 minimalist slippers logically yes 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.760
 we open to be easier but it costs 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.569
 a little bit everything also everything is 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.839
 Get used 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.610
 therefore friends very light sneaker 

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:42.469
 It is not the lightest we have 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.709
 had in the hands of character 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:49.219
 minimalist but very light small 

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:54.409
 tweaks to improve this version of the 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:56.449
 emt 10 the emt 10 v2 analyzed by brings 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.050
 in the dotcom running review we'll see you 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.050
 in the next analysis
