00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.700 

this<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> 35-inch<00:00:04.250> 4<00:00:05.250> x<00:00:05.520> 39<00:00:06.089> wat<00:00:06.330> h/o<00:00:06.839> retro

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
this is a 35-inch 4 x 39 wat h/o retro

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.759 
this is a 35-inch 4 x 39 wat h/o retro
and<00:00:08.179> it's<00:00:09.179> all<00:00:09.360> has<00:00:09.630> independent<00:00:10.290> reflectors

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and it's all has independent reflectors

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.410 
and it's all has independent reflectors
with<00:00:10.980> German<00:00:11.309> polished<00:00:11.639> aluminum<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.269> them

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
with German polished aluminum in them

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.629 
with German polished aluminum in them
and<00:00:13.170> notice<00:00:13.500> how<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.710> has<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> push<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.370> clip

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and notice how it has the push on clip

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.220 
and notice how it has the push on clip
so<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> water<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.330> stuff<00:00:15.540> won't<00:00:15.750> get<00:00:15.960> there

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
so the water and stuff won't get there

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.830 
so the water and stuff won't get there
here's<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> bottom<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:18.420> running<00:00:18.630> on

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
here's the bottom of it it's running on

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590 
here's the bottom of it it's running on
advanced<00:00:19.289> five-year<00:00:19.890> ballast<00:00:20.420> see<00:00:21.420> how<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
advanced five-year ballast see how the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.179 
advanced five-year ballast see how the
valves<00:00:22.080> are<00:00:22.199> set<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> air<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:22.980> heat

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
valves are set up in the air so the heat

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.250 
valves are set up in the air so the heat
can<00:00:23.400> go<00:00:23.550> all<00:00:23.730> around<00:00:23.880> them<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:24.930> cool

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
can go all around them so they can cool

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.339 
can go all around them so they can cool
down<00:00:25.609> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> high<00:00:27.060> heat<00:00:27.330> tube<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
down this is a high heat tube that the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.870 
down this is a high heat tube that the
wires<00:00:28.560> go<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.010> there<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> protect<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
wires go in there to protect all the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640 
wires go in there to protect all the
wires<00:00:30.090> from<00:00:30.210> heat<00:00:30.599> these<00:00:31.320> are<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> little

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
wires from heat these are the little

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.250 
wires from heat these are the little
brackets<00:00:32.219> that's<00:00:32.610> set<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> ballast<00:00:34.140> so

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
brackets that's set up or the ballast so

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.540 
brackets that's set up or the ballast so
the<00:00:34.380> ballast<00:00:34.680> sit<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> air<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> air

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the ballast sit in the air so the air

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.389 
the ballast sit in the air so the air
can<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.059> around<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.950> here's<00:00:38.250> how

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
can get all around them and here's how

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.260 
can get all around them and here's how
he<00:00:38.430> assembles<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.870> ballast
