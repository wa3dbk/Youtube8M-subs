00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.700
 people and welcome to my 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.580
 new video in today's video goes 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 it's about typical student types yes i know 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.630
 there are already thousands of videos about it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 but I tried to sort of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 do not take that in any video 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.539
 so not something like that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.119
 nerd or avi or something but just 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 as I said, what does not happen so often and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.980
 yes I brought two friends 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 hey says to them 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.669
 hey yes as always I would say 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.590
 We will not be messing around for so long 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
 receive directly 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.070
 yes my first student would have 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 actually each know our is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.450
 this person who always asks questions 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.860
 So it's always my ok you're in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.590
 Of course you can ask the school 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.570
 But this person exaggerates 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.570
 really the only questions left 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.149
 Excuse me, please 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.789
 I have a question so I could have 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.189
 Once again a question is yes 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.220
 actually either way i would have one more time 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.020
 a kind of number two I do not know whether 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 This person at home has nothing to eat 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 get or just ads but has 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.479
 This person is constantly in the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.479
 classes 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.430
 Number three, I believe everyone 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.320
 happened by us and that is it 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.450
 daydreamer you know it when you are 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.160
 just just do not pay any attention 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.280
 can and somehow a different world 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.360
 drifted off then yes happened 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.360
 maybe this one 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.970
 victoria 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.090
 I did not know how to be next 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.370
 breathe should I have here now assess the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.920
 called nÃ¶rgler and it is this 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.600
 person who has always rum mecca of mac 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.730
 really about everything about the tasks 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.080
 which one must do about his notes 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.810
 about the teacher about the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.450
 everything is beautiful 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.520
 shit that's so unnecessary what we do 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.430
 you do not even need that later 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.800
 It makes me want that okay I do 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.330
 it is still unnecessary 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.490
 then there are the people who never 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.890
 Doing her homework and every time 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.420
 Everyone wants to write in the morning 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.340
 you forget the homework now 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.990
 not bad but always is 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.030
 already up to much 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.590
 Peter do you have the homework I have 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.320
 yesterday not make it as 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.030
 please peter I can speak German 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.410
 maybe I write it 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.390
 somehow not understood 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.730
 oh and maybe my own 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.890
 Calculator was broken and offer 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.989
 I will each of you have a person 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.360
 in the class is always at the door 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.690
 and wait until the teacher comes around 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.380
 to do this 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.030
 he's called the next kind too 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.100
 the carver the people are themselves 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.260
 did not report normally but always 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.300
 I have to admit I do it 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.650
 also from time to time but really not on 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.510
 but there are also people who 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.320
 really exaggerating and doing great 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:49.959
 Annoying is why he does not take me 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:52.160
 namely, do not wear it 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.630
 I have somehow for the next kind 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.880
 no name i describe it to you 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.190
 just this person discussed 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.410
 just always with the teacher whether to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.959
 the lesson or rather more 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.730
 so for example his notes or 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.430
 no idea in any case, the pictures 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.109
 Teachers always challenging 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.730
 always discuss and I do not know 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.989
 Hope you know this person I know 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.030
 many of them 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.010
 why I have now ne 3 and 11 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.879
 sorry i understand my note 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.169
 not exactly 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.299
 Mr. Teacher, why do I have now 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.370
 actually a two oral that 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.720
 does not make him much sense to me 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.550
 it is already clear that it is so 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.889
 would have to be or then there is one more 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.639
 Annoying way, this student of 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:38.580
 I can never do anything with Peter 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:42.310
 maybe a book thank you peter 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.840
 Did you feel like a pen for me ? 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.400
 a note maybe or a 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.289
 eraser live 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.000
 Calculators come too 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.400
 My last point is not that 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.169
 kind but I bet that everyone already 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.030
 times you know that if you 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.250
 just talk to somebody in the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.530
 teaching or someone talking to you 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.840
 and the teacher thinks you are not watching 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.610
 then it takes you off and you know 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.220
 the answer and that is such a cool one 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.900
 Feeling I know that the solution is quite 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.340
 that's the number that makes viktoria 23 yes 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.780
 that was it from my video 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.099
 I hope you liked it if so 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.169
 then like to give me a thumb 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.270
 I would really appreciate that 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.620
 if you want to participate in the second team 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.630
 In any case, there are still a lot of people 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.250
 other types one likes to write me in 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.800
 the comments then I would too 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.300
 very much like to do and yes other side 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.729
 still comes to my last video 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.110
 and I would say see you 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.110
 hopefully the next time again
