00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.569
 cosmetic house comes introduces a hand and nato care line for the 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.710
 real man 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.030
 the line consisting of six products is tailored to the special requirements of the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.929
 man 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.430
 actor and presenter koan jan de bruin is the first man in the netherlands who has knowledge 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.720
 makes the generally living altar henin with the line 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.400
 3 9 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.310
 time 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.199
 out of the way 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 that takes some getting used to 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.649
 sample 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.649
 the project 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.420
 which I find very beautiful and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.220
 dico men's line is that it really has a masculine appearance that it 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.790
 Easy to use is that you won't last very long 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.680
 and you're busy taking care of you differently, and I think that's the power 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.870
 to come from 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.460
 but true research shows that 34 percent of Dutch men 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.880
 is dissatisfied with the nails 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.640
 this puts the hands in third place after the dissatisfaction with the belly 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.920
 tanda 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 also have bought these products for my friend 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.640
 yes i think you could not buy anything for one 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.940
 it st it in the hospitality industry of these products from a friend of mine and 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.970
 There they are through it is really nice for your friend instead of once 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.620
 a bag or pair of socks across borders 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.230
 it is also nice to buy something out for the man's care 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.340
 is a well-known given andries a calling card 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.810
 Abroad, therefore, it has been common practice for many years for men to be regular 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.580
 to undergo a manicure treatment 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.910
 thanks to the special men's line you also await the dutch man 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.160
 hands and clean nails yours 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240
 The consultation has been specially developed for men who are concerned about the performance 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.700
 want to see 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.130
 then recent research by van der ditch showed that in addition to the beautiful well-groomed 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.180
 teeth 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.230
 ask the man to have nice hands 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.940
 look nice and well-kept 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.280
 I think that this type of product would use the agent, which is also unnecessary 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.520
 of course he knows 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.299
 stay nice for the heat lost absolutely a very nice club and I know 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.449
 definitely use that 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.469
 the horse
