00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.420 
managed help me source this driftwood
tree<00:00:13.440> which<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.780> made<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.289> wood<00:00:16.680> slice<00:00:17.010> and

lots of different branches and the way

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.730 
lots of different branches and the way
we're<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> start<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.140> design<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.619> by

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
we're going to start this design is by

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.000 
we're going to start this design is by
attaching<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.460> Oasis<00:00:24.210> igloo<00:00:24.480> cages

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
attaching the Oasis igloo cages

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.339 
attaching the Oasis igloo cages
throughout<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.550> driftwood<00:00:27.269> tree<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> I'm

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
throughout the driftwood tree and I'm

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.290 
throughout the driftwood tree and I'm
going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> use<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.220> aluminum<00:00:29.670> wire<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
going to use the aluminum wire just

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840 
going to use the aluminum wire just
because<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> grabs<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.710> easily<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.579> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
because it grabs things so easily and I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.090 
because it grabs things so easily and I
know<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.239> they're<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.420> there<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:34.100> securely

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
know that they're on there very securely

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.389 
know that they're on there very securely
and<00:00:35.750> they're<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> move<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.829> it's

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and they're not going to move and it's

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
and they're not going to move and it's
also<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.820> decorative<00:00:39.210> wire<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.590> easy<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
also a decorative wire so it's easy to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:55.060 
also a decorative wire so it's easy to
cover<00:00:41.129> up

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.890 

I'm<00:00:55.550> also<00:00:55.850> going<00:00:56.150> to<00:00:56.210> be<00:00:56.360> creating<00:00:56.810> a

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
I'm also going to be creating a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.540 
I'm also going to be creating a
beautiful<00:00:57.050> runner<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.800> go<00:00:57.950> at<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.190> bottom<00:00:58.460> of

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
beautiful runner to go at the bottom of

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.540 
beautiful runner to go at the bottom of
this<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.090> how<00:00:59.660> I'm<00:00:59.750> going<00:00:59.810> to<00:01:00.170> do<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
this and how I'm going to do that is the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.049 
this and how I'm going to do that is the
oasis<00:01:02.320> garlands<00:01:03.380> I've<00:01:03.800> actually<00:01:04.489> covered

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
these with saran so this not only is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.150 
these with saran so this not only is
going<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.240> help<00:01:08.870> in<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.230> messiness<00:01:09.560> like<00:01:10.010> to

to these roses here and it's a really
easy<00:01:45.500> technique<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.430> opens<00:01:46.790> them<00:01:47.000> up<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.020> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
you can really see it takes up a lot of

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.900 
you can really see it takes up a lot of
space<00:01:50.720> in<00:01:50.990> your<00:01:51.020> foam<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:52.550> adds<00:01:52.759> a

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
space in your foam it really adds a

richness and a lushness to your designs

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.190 
richness and a lushness to your designs
if<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.640> take<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> time<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.270> go<00:01:56.540> ahead<00:01:56.690> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
if you take the time to go ahead and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.050 
if you take the time to go ahead and
reflex<00:01:57.920> them<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.310> basically<00:01:58.520> you're<00:01:59.030> just

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
reflex them and basically you're just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.050 
reflex them and basically you're just
pulling<00:01:59.450> each<00:01:59.930> petal<00:02:00.380> individually<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.430> kind

of<00:02:02.150> flipping<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.630> backwards<00:02:03.110> inside<00:02:03.590> out<00:02:03.800> as

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
of flipping it backwards inside out as

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
of flipping it backwards inside out as
you<00:02:05.540> can<00:02:05.690> see<00:02:06.909> these<00:02:07.909> Vendela<00:02:08.510> roses<00:02:08.989> almost

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
you can see these Vendela roses almost

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.830 
you can see these Vendela roses almost
look<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.010> gardenia<00:02:10.519> when<00:02:10.850> they're<00:02:11.030> reflux
