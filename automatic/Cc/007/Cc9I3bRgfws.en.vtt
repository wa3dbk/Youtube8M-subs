00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.120 
attached to their shells holes were

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
drilled in the shells of these animals

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.490

and<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.880> handles<00:02:30.330> were<00:02:30.480> attacked<00:02:30.870> apparently

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

the<00:02:31.620> owner<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.220> animals<00:02:32.730> claimed<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.180> he

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the owner of the animals claimed that he

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.360 
the owner of the animals claimed that he
did<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.990> he<00:02:34.020> could<00:02:34.260> carry<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.950> tortoise

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
did it so he could carry the tortoise

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.400 
did it so he could carry the tortoise
around<00:02:35.640> by<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:35.970> handle<00:02:36.480> which<00:02:36.690> weighed<00:02:36.840> 25<00:02:37.230> to

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
around by the handle which weighed 25 to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.530 
around by the handle which weighed 25 to
30<00:02:37.620> pounds<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.580> box<00:02:38.790> turtle<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.420> be

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
30 pounds and so the box turtle can be

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.510 
30 pounds and so the box turtle can be
leashed<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:40.140> while<00:02:40.440> he<00:02:40.590> left<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.890> outside<00:02:41.040> no

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
leashed up while he left it outside no

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
with the stores we did today it's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.880 
with the stores we did today it's
something<00:03:06.989> I've<00:03:07.080> been<00:03:07.110> thinking<00:03:07.230> about<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.860> a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
something I've been thinking about for a

something I've been thinking about for a
long<00:03:07.950> time<00:03:08.400> do<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.910> think<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.660> smart<00:03:10.170> or<00:03:10.530> do

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
long time do you think it is smart or do

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.860 
long time do you think it is smart or do
you<00:03:10.709> think<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:11.160> harmful<00:03:11.610> for<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.269> animals

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you think it's harmful for the animals

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.130 
you think it's harmful for the animals
if<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.410> did<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:14.820> education<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.540> research

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140
