Thomas here bringing you some more black
ops<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.640> figured<00:00:15.330> everybody<00:00:16.259> is<00:00:16.470> playing<00:00:16.650> this

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:17.009 
ops I figured everybody is playing this

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.040 
ops I figured everybody is playing this
at<00:00:17.339> least<00:00:17.580> every<00:00:18.029> single<00:00:18.419> person<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.869> my

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
at least every single person on my

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.800 
at least every single person on my
friend<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.499> just<00:00:19.710> pulling<00:00:20.009> this<00:00:20.249> so<00:00:21.089> I<00:00:21.119> assume

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
friend was just pulling this so I assume

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
friend was just pulling this so I assume
everybody<00:00:22.140> else<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.220> planet<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.730> well

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
everybody else is in the planet as well

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.909 
everybody else is in the planet as well
so<00:00:24.449> i<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:25.079> just<00:00:25.109> probably<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.679> to<00:00:25.769> stick

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
so i I'm just probably going to stick

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.609 
so i I'm just probably going to stick
with<00:00:25.949> black<00:00:26.249> ops<00:00:26.490> until<00:00:26.909> a<00:00:27.079> lot<00:00:28.079> of<00:00:28.199> people<00:00:28.439> I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
with black ops until a lot of people I

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
with black ops until a lot of people I
just<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.980> sick<00:00:29.159> of<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.609> want<00:00:29.909> something

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.400 
just get sick of it or want something
else<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.169> if<00:00:31.829> you<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.250> speak<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.110> if

getting<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.179> ninja<00:01:24.569> pro<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> worth<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.380> I

it's<00:01:38.999> that<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.359> better<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.810> says<00:01:40.079> oh<00:01:40.289> if

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it's that much better like it says oh if

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.959 
it's that much better like it says oh if
you're<00:01:40.560> silent<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.369> hear<00:01:41.609> enemies

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.149 
you're silent you can hear enemies
better<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.929> don't<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.319> feel<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.709> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
better but I don't really feel like it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
better but I don't really feel like it's
like<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.109> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
like you can really it's really that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
like you can really it's really that
much<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.799> difference<00:01:47.329> because<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.450> can

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
much of a difference because you can

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
much of a difference because you can
really<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.259> hear<00:01:49.770> enemies<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.399> less<00:01:50.670> in

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
really you hear enemies a lot less in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
really you hear enemies a lot less in
this<00:01:50.999> game<00:01:51.209> then<00:01:51.389> I<00:01:51.479> feel<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.929> modern

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229

this game then I feel like in modern
warfare<00:01:52.289> 2<00:01:52.859> where<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.639> could<00:01:53.789> really<00:01:53.909> just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
warfare 2 where you could really just

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.789 
warfare 2 where you could really just
kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.359> sit<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.749> and<00:01:54.899> listen<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.439> know

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.929 
exactly where people are you know you
can<00:01:58.259> still<00:01:58.529> like<00:01:58.979> listen<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.609> bit<00:01:59.819> in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
can still like listen a little bit in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
can still like listen a little bit in
this<00:02:00.090> game<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.479> there's<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.749> lot<00:02:00.869> more<00:02:00.899> chaos

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
this game but there's a lot more chaos

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.490 
this game but there's a lot more chaos
and<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
and the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.340 
and the
the<00:02:03.120> their<00:02:04.120> footsteps<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.930> movement

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
the their footsteps and movement

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.570 
the their footsteps and movement
patterns<00:02:05.710> are<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> little<00:02:05.980> more<00:02:06.220> like<00:02:06.400> in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
patterns are a little more like in

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.160 
patterns are a little more like in
surround<00:02:07.000> sound<00:02:07.150> and<00:02:07.450> blend<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.930> with<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
surround sound and blend in with the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.810 
surround sound and blend in with the
environment<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.860> it's<00:02:09.039> kind<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.369> hard<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.610> pick

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
environment so it's kind of hard to pick

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.810 
environment so it's kind of hard to pick
them<00:02:09.970> out<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.590> know<00:02:11.620> once<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.190> get<00:02:12.700> the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
them out but you know once you get the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.190 
them out but you know once you get the
maps<00:02:13.030> down<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> little<00:02:13.510> more<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.960> kind<00:02:14.170> of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
maps down a little more and that kind of

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.530 
maps down a little more and that kind of
thing<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.380> can<00:02:14.590> kind<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:14.800> guess<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:16.270> anyway

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
thing you can kind of guess but anyway

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
thing you can kind of guess but anyway
whole<00:02:17.200> reason<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.560> kind<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.770> posted<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.190> match

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
whole reason I kind of posted this match

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.699 
whole reason I kind of posted this match
is<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.209> got<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.540> got<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.930> gunship<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.590> it

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
is because I got a I got a gunship in it

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.170 
is because I got a I got a gunship in it
later<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.670> don't<00:02:21.820> know<00:02:21.880> if<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.060> guys

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
later on and I don't know if you guys

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.150 
later on and I don't know if you guys
have<00:02:22.420> I've<00:02:22.959> gotten<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.470> those<00:02:23.590> yet<00:02:23.950> or

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
have I've gotten one of those yet or

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.520 
have I've gotten one of those yet or
seen<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.850> against<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:25.480> whatever<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:26.020> but

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
seen it against you or whatever but but

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.740 
seen it against you or whatever but but
i<00:02:26.560> thought<00:02:26.800> i<00:02:26.860> would<00:02:27.040> post<00:02:27.220> post<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.300> gunship

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
i thought i would post post a gunship

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.410 
i thought i would post post a gunship
gameplay<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
gameplay this is the this is like the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.180 
gameplay this is the this is like the
first<00:02:31.600> one<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> got<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.320> might<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.770> got<00:02:32.950> another

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
first one I got I might I got another

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.500 
first one I got I might I got another
one<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.610> was<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:33.790> probably<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.240> end<00:02:34.390> of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
one but it was like probably the end of

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.479 
one but it was like probably the end of
a<00:02:34.600> match<00:02:34.780> or<00:02:34.959> something<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:35.950> really<00:02:36.370> don't

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
a match or something so I really don't

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.060 
a match or something so I really don't
know<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> hell<00:02:37.000> I'm<00:02:37.120> doing<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
know what the hell I'm doing with it the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.070 
know what the hell I'm doing with it the
gunships<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:40.060> know<00:02:40.180> chopper<00:02:40.660> gunners<00:02:40.930> that

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
gunships you know chopper gunners that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.770 
gunships you know chopper gunners that
kind<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> thing<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.650> be<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.000> devastating

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
kind of thing can be so so devastating

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.840 
kind of thing can be so so devastating
in<00:02:43.930> call<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.260> duty<00:02:45.330> just<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.250> they<00:02:48.250> I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
in call of duty just just because they I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.280 
in call of duty just just because they I
mean<00:02:49.000> they're<00:02:49.420> obviously<00:02:49.750> harder<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.140> get

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
mean they're obviously harder to get

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.420 
mean they're obviously harder to get
because<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.590> really<00:02:50.800> have<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.010> earn<00:02:51.160> them

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
because you really have to earn them

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.070 
because you really have to earn them
with<00:02:52.330> kills<00:02:52.690> only<00:02:53.020> but<00:02:54.060> once<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.270> get<00:02:55.750> there

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
with kills only but once you get there

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.260 
with kills only but once you get there
as<00:02:56.260> long<00:02:56.440> as<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.920> enemy<00:02:57.100> team<00:02:57.459> does<00:02:57.820> not<00:02:58.000> shoot

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
as long as the enemy team does not shoot

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.290 
as long as the enemy team does not shoot
it<00:02:58.420> down<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.050> find<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.590> like<00:03:00.300> ninety-nine

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
it down and I find that like ninety-nine

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.810 
it down and I find that like ninety-nine
percent<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.810> games<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.260> I've<00:03:02.320> played

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
percent of the games and I've played

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.150 
percent of the games and I've played
either<00:03:03.820> against<00:03:04.630> us<00:03:04.780> or<00:03:04.959> for<00:03:05.200> us<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.800> people

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
either against us or for us that people

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.410 
either against us or for us that people
don't<00:03:06.310> really<00:03:06.489> shoot<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.880> choppers<00:03:07.239> down

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
don't really shoot the choppers down

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.960 
don't really shoot the choppers down
that<00:03:07.660> much<00:03:07.810> which<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.590> kind<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.799> funny<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.880> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
that much which is kind of funny so the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.280 
that much which is kind of funny so the
chopper<00:03:10.209> gunner<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.630> know<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:11.019> have<00:03:11.170> it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
chopper gunner you know you can have it

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.170 
chopper gunner you know you can have it
up<00:03:11.410> for<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.739> minute<00:03:12.040> or<00:03:12.190> two<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.400> if<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
up for like a minute or two and if the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.140 
up for like a minute or two and if the
other<00:03:13.330> team<00:03:13.600> isn't<00:03:13.810> like<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.610> indoors<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.970> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
other team isn't like in indoors and and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
other team isn't like in indoors and and
hidden<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.680> go<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.070> work

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
hidden you can just go to work

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.479 
hidden you can just go to work
especially<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.049> in<00:03:20.230> big<00:03:20.500> team<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.980> what's

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
especially in the in big team and what's

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.949 
especially in the in big team and what's
really<00:03:21.610> cool<00:03:21.850> about<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.120> gunship<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.810> it's

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
really cool about the gunship is it's

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.360 
really cool about the gunship is it's
pretty<00:03:23.140> much<00:03:23.290> like<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.560> chopper<00:03:23.950> gunner<00:03:24.130> um

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
pretty much like the chopper gunner um

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.180 
pretty much like the chopper gunner um
but<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.480> also<00:03:25.690> get<00:03:25.959> missiles<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.010> can

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
but you also get missiles and you can

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.580 
but you also get missiles and you can
control<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.940> fly<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.299> thing<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.930> don't<00:03:29.500> know

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
control and fly the thing I don't know

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.350 
control and fly the thing I don't know
if<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.709> guys<00:03:29.830> completed<00:03:30.640> single<00:03:31.060> player<00:03:31.209> at

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
if you guys completed single player at

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.850

using your killstreaks because you know

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.690 
using your killstreaks because you know
like<00:04:07.570> for<00:04:07.780> me<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.900> like<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.260> do<00:04:08.380> like<00:04:08.950> get<00:04:09.579> the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
like for me I like to do like get the

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.970 
like for me I like to do like get the
regular<00:04:09.940> chopper<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.810> then<00:04:11.050> go<00:04:11.349> like<00:04:11.560> chopper

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
regular chopper and then go like chopper

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.770 
regular chopper and then go like chopper
gunner<00:04:12.190> this<00:04:12.640> well<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.300> can<00:04:13.450> only<00:04:13.569> have<00:04:13.750> one

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
gunner this well you can only have one

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.870 
gunner this well you can only have one
chopper<00:04:14.440> out<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.280> probably

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
chopper out so it's probably

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.550 
chopper out so it's probably
better<00:04:16.000> for<00:04:16.300> you<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.420> plan<00:04:16.750> your<00:04:16.780> kill<00:04:17.230> streaks

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
better for you to plan your kill streaks

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.600 
better for you to plan your kill streaks
by<00:04:18.040> only<00:04:18.310> having<00:04:18.340> one<00:04:18.910> chopper<00:04:19.690> gunner<00:04:19.930> in<00:04:20.290> it

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
by only having one chopper gunner in it

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.830 
by only having one chopper gunner in it
that<00:04:21.610> way<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:21.850> can<00:04:22.090> kind<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.330> use<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.570> other

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
that way you can kind of use the other

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.140 
that way you can kind of use the other
one<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.320> get<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> chopper<00:04:24.340> gunner<00:04:24.730> but<00:04:25.000> then

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
one so I get a chopper gunner but then

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.790 
one so I get a chopper gunner but then
also<00:04:25.300> get<00:04:25.600> dogs<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.170> you<00:04:26.290> can<00:04:26.410> have<00:04:26.560> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
also get dogs so you can have the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.530 
also get dogs so you can have the
chopper<00:04:27.130> gunner<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.490> dogs<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:28.150> at<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.360> same

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
chopper gunner and dogs out at the same

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.300 
chopper gunner and dogs out at the same
time<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:29.050> know<00:04:29.140> like<00:04:29.350> have<00:04:29.530> complementing

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.510 
you get like dual quad rocket launchers
so<00:05:09.970> it's<00:05:10.120> really<00:05:10.480> ridiculous<00:05:11.250> but<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.400> know

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
so it's really ridiculous but you know

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.280 
so it's really ridiculous but you know
if<00:05:12.760> you're<00:05:12.940> if<00:05:13.180> you're<00:05:13.300> smart<00:05:13.660> with<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.050> and

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
if you're if you're smart with this and

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.560 
if you're if you're smart with this and
you<00:05:14.440> get<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.710> right<00:05:14.830> angles<00:05:15.280> you<00:05:16.060> can<00:05:16.090> really

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
you get the right angles you can really

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.210 
you get the right angles you can really
go<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.810> work<00:05:17.050> this<00:05:17.230> is<00:05:17.380> probably<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.740> pretty<00:05:17.920> bad

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
go to work this is probably a pretty bad

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.860 
go to work this is probably a pretty bad
map<00:05:18.550> for<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:18.970> just<00:05:19.120> because<00:05:19.240> there's<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.690> lot<00:05:19.840> of

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
map for it just because there's a lot of

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.140 
map for it just because there's a lot of
indoor<00:05:20.800> areas<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.550> stuff<00:05:21.730> like<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:22.030> lot

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
indoor areas and stuff like that a lot

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.450 
indoor areas and stuff like that a lot
of<00:05:22.210> alleyways<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.810> buildings<00:05:23.500> around<00:05:23.740> but<00:05:24.370> if

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
of alleyways and buildings around but if

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.130 
of alleyways and buildings around but if
you<00:05:24.550> were<00:05:24.670> like<00:05:24.820> on<00:05:24.970> jungle<00:05:25.510> or<00:05:25.870> something

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
you were like on jungle or something

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.830 
you were like on jungle or something
like<00:05:26.260> that<00:05:26.320> that's<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.800> little<00:05:27.010> more<00:05:27.190> open<00:05:27.840> yeah

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
like that that's a little more open yeah

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.360 
like that that's a little more open yeah
it's<00:05:29.350> it's<00:05:29.890> pretty<00:05:30.250> nasty<00:05:31.860> yeah<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:33.130> anyway

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
it's it's pretty nasty yeah so anyway

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.440 
it's it's pretty nasty yeah so anyway
back<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.670> the<00:05:33.760> kill<00:05:33.910> tricks<00:05:34.150> like<00:05:34.240> I<00:05:34.330> was

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
back to the kill tricks like I was

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.610 
back to the kill tricks like I was
saying<00:05:34.690> you<00:05:34.810> really<00:05:34.990> want<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.200> like<00:05:35.290> kind<00:05:35.530> of

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
saying you really want to like kind of

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.870 
saying you really want to like kind of
plan<00:05:36.130> them<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.760> be<00:05:36.880> complementary<00:05:37.750> I<00:05:38.760> you<00:05:39.760> know

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
plan them to be complementary I you know

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.520 
plan them to be complementary I you know
I<00:05:39.910> don't<00:05:40.390> really<00:05:40.540> like<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:41.110> lot<00:05:41.350> of<00:05:41.380> the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
I don't really like a lot of the

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.350 
I don't really like a lot of the
airstrike<00:05:42.070> stuff<00:05:42.400> I<00:05:42.580> mean<00:05:42.760> every<00:05:42.970> once<00:05:43.180> in<00:05:43.300> a

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
airstrike stuff I mean every once in a

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.910 
airstrike stuff I mean every once in a
while<00:05:43.510> but<00:05:43.750> for<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.080> most<00:05:44.230> part<00:05:44.350> I<00:05:44.590> feel<00:05:44.620> like

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
while but for the most part I feel like

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.950 
while but for the most part I feel like
you<00:05:45.130> can<00:05:45.310> kind<00:05:45.490> of<00:05:45.550> avoid<00:05:45.880> those<00:05:46.090> relatively

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
you can kind of avoid those relatively

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.230 
you can kind of avoid those relatively
easy<00:05:47.380> unless<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.610> really<00:05:48.790> kind<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.090> get<00:05:49.210> the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
easy unless you really kind of get the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.990 
easy unless you really kind of get the
drop<00:05:49.540> on<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:50.440> enemy<00:05:50.590> team<00:05:50.770> but<00:05:51.730> you<00:05:51.880> know

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
drop on the enemy team but you know

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.990 
drop on the enemy team but you know
usually<00:05:52.180> having<00:05:52.840> like<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.380> some<00:05:54.250> kind<00:05:54.430> of<00:05:54.460> UAV

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
usually having like a some kind of UAV

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.680 
usually having like a some kind of UAV
or<00:05:55.390> counter<00:05:55.930> UAV<00:05:56.250> followed<00:05:57.250> by<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.790> chopper<00:05:58.390> or

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
or counter UAV followed by a chopper or

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.590 
or counter UAV followed by a chopper or
or<00:05:59.290> or<00:05:59.920> some<00:06:00.340> kind<00:06:00.520> of<00:06:00.550> air<00:06:00.760> strike<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.270> then

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
or or some kind of air strike and then

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.660 
or or some kind of air strike and then
either<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.290> chopper<00:06:02.740> gunner<00:06:02.920> dogs<00:06:03.310> or

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
either the chopper gunner dogs or

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.190 
either the chopper gunner dogs or
whatever<00:06:03.940> it<00:06:04.450> kind<00:06:04.630> of<00:06:04.660> depends<00:06:04.960> on<00:06:05.080> your

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
whatever it kind of depends on your

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.230 
whatever it kind of depends on your
place<00:06:05.380> out<00:06:05.590> what<00:06:05.830> you<00:06:05.920> can<00:06:06.010> actually<00:06:06.280> get<00:06:06.730> like

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
place out what you can actually get like

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.820 
place out what you can actually get like
legitimately<00:06:07.960> you<00:06:08.230> don't<00:06:08.500> want<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:08.680> go<00:06:08.770> too

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
legitimately you don't want to go too

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.190 
legitimately you don't want to go too
big<00:06:09.390> when<00:06:10.390> you're<00:06:10.510> only<00:06:10.630> going<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.900> get<00:06:10.990> that

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
big when you're only going to get that

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.110 
big when you're only going to get that
maybe<00:06:11.530> like<00:06:11.800> once<00:06:12.130> a<00:06:12.400> game<00:06:12.610> or<00:06:12.880> every<00:06:13.060> couple

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
maybe like once a game or every couple

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.790 
maybe like once a game or every couple
of<00:06:13.480> games<00:06:13.660> it's<00:06:13.960> better<00:06:14.140> for<00:06:14.350> you<00:06:14.410> to<00:06:14.440> just<00:06:14.650> go

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
of games it's better for you to just go

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.920 
of games it's better for you to just go
three<00:06:15.100> four<00:06:15.280> five<00:06:15.460> you<00:06:16.240> know<00:06:16.360> and<00:06:16.570> just<00:06:16.600> and

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
three four five you know and just and

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.570 
three four five you know and just and
just<00:06:16.960> run<00:06:17.290> through<00:06:17.500> those<00:06:17.710> like<00:06:18.070> you<00:06:18.490> know

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
just run through those like you know

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.040 
just run through those like you know
every<00:06:18.820> every<00:06:19.180> other<00:06:19.300> life<00:06:19.570> or<00:06:19.600> whatever

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
every every other life or whatever

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.840 
every every other life or whatever
you'll<00:06:20.620> get<00:06:20.740> a<00:06:20.800> lot<00:06:20.980> more<00:06:21.040> experience<00:06:21.430> and

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
you'll get a lot more experience and

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.310 
you'll get a lot more experience and
with<00:06:22.030> the<00:06:22.150> care<00:06:22.330> packages<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:22.990> that<00:06:23.080> kind<00:06:23.260> of

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
with the care packages and that kind of

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.090 
with the care packages and that kind of
thing<00:06:23.380> you<00:06:23.500> can<00:06:23.800> you<00:06:24.040> know

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
thing you can you know

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.980 
thing you can you know
usually<00:06:25.520> get<00:06:25.760> some<00:06:26.090> some<00:06:26.300> pretty<00:06:26.570> good<00:06:26.720> kill

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
usually get some some pretty good kill

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.330 
usually get some some pretty good kill
streaks<00:06:27.290> out<00:06:27.440> of<00:06:27.560> it<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.800> mean<00:06:27.980> they've<00:06:28.100> toned
