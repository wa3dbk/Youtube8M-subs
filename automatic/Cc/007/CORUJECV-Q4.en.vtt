and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.869> course<00:02:06.960> he<00:02:07.290> also<00:02:07.409> said<00:02:07.799> my<00:02:08.310> hope

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and then of course he also said my hope

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.729 
and then of course he also said my hope
my<00:02:08.610> expectation<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.780> after<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
my expectation is that after the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.830 
my expectation is that after the
election<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.270> turns<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> gold

beating Obama

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
beating Obama
doesn't<00:02:13.800> make<00:02:13.860> much<00:02:13.920> sense<00:02:14.129> because<00:02:14.819> I'm<00:02:15.060> not

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
doesn't make much sense because I'm not

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
doesn't make much sense because I'm not
running<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.459> start

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
running again then that we can start

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.420 
running again then that we can start
getting<00:02:17.760> some<00:02:18.150> cooperation<00:02:18.870> again<00:02:19.410> now<00:02:20.220> look

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
getting some cooperation again now look

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.890 
getting some cooperation again now look
final<00:02:20.879> thing<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.599> it's<00:02:21.750> not

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
final thing on this is that it's not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.530 
final thing on this is that it's not
that<00:02:22.530> these<00:02:22.709> guys<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.970> thickest
