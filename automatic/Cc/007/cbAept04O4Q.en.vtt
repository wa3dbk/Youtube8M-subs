00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
system installed with the video inputs

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.999 
system installed with the video inputs
we're<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.499> show<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.709> how<00:00:10.799> to<00:00:10.860> install

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.009 
we're going to show you how to install

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.949 
we're going to show you how to install
your<00:00:11.219> backup<00:00:11.700> camera<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.299> that<00:00:12.629> it<00:00:12.870> is

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
your backup camera so that it is

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:20.410 
your backup camera so that it is
activated<00:00:13.469> when<00:00:13.589> you<00:00:13.620> go<00:00:13.799> into<00:00:13.919> reverse

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.420 

so<00:00:20.630> I<00:00:20.900> ordered<00:00:21.080> a<00:00:21.349> stereo<00:00:21.800> that<00:00:22.039> came<00:00:22.250> with<00:00:22.400> a

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
so I ordered a stereo that came with a

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.220 
so I ordered a stereo that came with a
backup<00:00:22.699> camera<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:23.300> it<00:00:23.539> was<00:00:23.660> all<00:00:23.840> made<00:00:24.080> sure<00:00:24.199> it

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
backup camera so it was all made sure it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.269 
backup camera so it was all made sure it
would<00:00:24.380> all<00:00:24.470> work<00:00:24.500> together<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.099> they're

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
would all work together but they're

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.769 
would all work together but they're
pretty<00:00:25.430> standard<00:00:25.759> so<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:26.180> just<00:00:26.449> find<00:00:26.689> the

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
pretty standard so you just find the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.679 
pretty standard so you just find the
video<00:00:27.590> camera<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.099> has<00:00:28.189> regular<00:00:28.369> RCA<00:00:29.000> input

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
video camera that has regular RCA input

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.109 
video camera that has regular RCA input
or<00:00:29.840> output<00:00:30.109> jacks<00:00:30.680> to<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.849> should<00:00:32.090> be

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
or output jacks to it and you should be

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.639 
or output jacks to it and you should be
able<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.449> hook<00:00:32.509> up<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.899> back<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.379> video

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
able to hook up to the back to the video

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.690 
able to hook up to the back to the video
in<00:00:33.860> portion<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.430> your<00:00:34.670> head<00:00:35.329> unit<00:00:35.690> on<00:00:35.780> your<00:00:35.899> car

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.710 

then<00:00:40.970> you<00:00:41.060> have<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.240> figure<00:00:41.390> out<00:00:41.570> where

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
then you have to figure out where

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
then you have to figure out where
exactly<00:00:41.750> you're<00:00:42.200> gonna<00:00:42.290> mount<00:00:42.470> it<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:42.680> the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
exactly you're gonna mount it in the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.990 
exactly you're gonna mount it in the
back<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:43.040> your<00:00:43.100> car<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.580> said<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.820> looked

back of your car and you said I looked
underneath<00:00:44.270> maybe<00:00:44.720> I<00:00:44.780> could<00:00:44.960> bolt<00:00:45.230> at<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
underneath maybe I could bolt at the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.410 
underneath maybe I could bolt at the
bottom<00:00:45.710> panel<00:00:45.950> oh<00:00:46.220> that<00:00:46.610> didn't<00:00:46.910> work<00:00:47.060> so<00:00:47.090> I

you<00:01:11.120> have<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.270> problem<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.470> I'm<00:01:12.560> going<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.770> drill

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
you have a problem so I'm going to drill

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.590 
you have a problem so I'm going to drill
a<00:01:12.920> couple<00:01:13.100> holes<00:01:13.310> here<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.820> mount<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.090> up<00:01:14.240> here

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
a couple holes here and mount it up here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.230 
a couple holes here and mount it up here
so<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.530> goes<00:01:16.160> into<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.550> car<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.000> it's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
so that it goes into the car now it's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.109 
so that it goes into the car now it's
going<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.420> take<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:17.690> back<00:01:17.960> panel<00:01:18.320> off<00:01:18.619> here

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
going to take this back panel off here

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.700 
going to take this back panel off here
okay<00:01:20.119> well<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.810> problem<00:01:21.020> is<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.410> that<00:01:21.440> when

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
okay well the problem is is that when

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.620 
okay well the problem is is that when
you<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:22.340> started<00:01:22.910> looking<00:01:23.119> around<00:01:23.180> looking

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
you I started looking around looking

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.350 
you I started looking around looking
around<00:01:23.660> at<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.290> back<00:01:24.650> panel<00:01:25.180> guess<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:26.330> I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
around at the back panel guess what I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.600 
around at the back panel guess what I
found

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
found

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.120 
found
well<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.640> found<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.180> sensor<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.350> BSA<00:01:30.920> could

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
well I found the sensor it's a BSA could

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.910 
well I found the sensor it's a BSA could
be<00:01:31.220> anti-lock<00:01:31.850> braking<00:01:32.410> system<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.530> could<00:01:33.680> be

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
be anti-lock braking system it could be

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.730 
be anti-lock braking system it could be
airbags<00:01:34.640> actually<00:01:35.479> anti-lock<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.470> airbag

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
airbags actually anti-lock and airbag

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.260 
airbags actually anti-lock and airbag
sort<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.040> work<00:01:37.160> together<00:01:37.340> during<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.850> collision

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
sort of work together during a collision

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.330 
sort of work together during a collision
and<00:01:38.360> everything<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:38.899> we<00:01:39.590> will<00:01:39.740> not<00:01:39.920> play<00:01:40.190> with

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
and everything so we will not play with

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.620 
and everything so we will not play with
that<00:01:40.430> sensor<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:40.940> I'm<00:01:41.030> not<00:01:41.149> gonna<00:01:41.270> rip<00:01:41.479> that

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
that sensor so I'm not gonna rip that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.480 
that sensor so I'm not gonna rip that
back<00:01:41.869> panel<00:01:42.170> off<00:01:42.470> or<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:42.710> gonna<00:01:43.250> leave<00:01:43.399> it

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
back panel off or just gonna leave it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.859 
back panel off or just gonna leave it
the<00:01:43.580> way<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.880> I'm<00:01:44.119> gonna<00:01:44.210> find<00:01:44.300> a<00:01:44.509> different

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
the way it is I'm gonna find a different

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.180 
the way it is I'm gonna find a different
way<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.500> wires<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.670> camera

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
way to get the wires to that camera

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.800 
way to get the wires to that camera
so<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.340> recap<00:01:49.580> we're<00:01:50.000> gonna<00:01:50.119> drill<00:01:50.660> a<00:01:50.690> couple

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
so to recap we're gonna drill a couple

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.540 
so to recap we're gonna drill a couple
holes<00:01:50.990> here<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.649> put<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.920> camera<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.369> right

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
holes here and put the camera in right

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.340 
holes here and put the camera in right
here<00:01:52.700> next<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.210> license<00:01:53.600> plate<00:01:53.810> for<00:01:54.170> that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
here next to the license plate for that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.900 
here next to the license plate for that
we're<00:01:54.560> gonna<00:01:54.649> need<00:01:54.770> some<00:01:55.190> drills<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.729> go<00:01:55.850> ahead

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
we're gonna need some drills to go ahead

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.029 
we're gonna need some drills to go ahead
and<00:01:56.090> drill<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.170> as<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.410> can<00:01:57.500> see<00:01:57.560> these

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
and drill and as you can see these

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.130 
and drill and as you can see these
drills<00:01:58.369> are<00:01:58.490> rated<00:01:58.789> for<00:01:59.030> wood<00:01:59.420> plastic<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
drills are rated for wood plastic and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.290 
drills are rated for wood plastic and
soft<00:02:00.410> metal<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.069> know<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> car<00:02:01.490> exterior

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
soft metal and you know the car exterior

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.880 
soft metal and you know the car exterior
usually<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.750> enough<00:02:03.020> soft<00:02:03.259> material

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
usually is enough soft material

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.199 
usually is enough soft material
depending<00:02:04.190> what<00:02:04.250> you're<00:02:04.429> going<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.670> use<00:02:04.910> these

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
depending what you're going to use these

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.490 
depending what you're going to use these
kind<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.539> drills<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.170> make<00:02:06.289> sure<00:02:06.319> you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
kind of drills so just make sure you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.890 
kind of drills so just make sure you
have<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.679> right<00:02:06.860> ones

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.510 

so<00:02:11.900> manufactures<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.740> this<00:02:12.890> nice<00:02:13.190> clean

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
so manufactures have this nice clean

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.770 
so manufactures have this nice clean
installation<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.150> goes<00:02:14.300> from<00:02:14.390> your<00:02:14.540> car's

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
installation that goes from your car's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.570 
installation that goes from your car's
electrical<00:02:14.960> system<00:02:15.620> goes<00:02:15.860> back<00:02:16.130> into<00:02:16.340> your

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
electrical system goes back into your

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.790 
electrical system goes back into your
trunk<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.300> have<00:02:17.450> things<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.380> lights<00:02:18.620> and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
trunk so you have things for lights and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.260 
trunk so you have things for lights and
all<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.340> are<00:02:19.460> built<00:02:19.610> into<00:02:19.790> your<00:02:20.000> trunk

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
all that that are built into your trunk

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.230 
all that that are built into your trunk
for<00:02:20.510> example<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.710> light<00:02:22.220> illumination<00:02:22.940> for

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
for example the light illumination for

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.700 
for example the light illumination for
your<00:02:23.420> license<00:02:23.780> plates<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.140> everything<00:02:24.530> and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
your license plates and everything and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.230 
your license plates and everything and
that<00:02:24.860> ABS<00:02:25.310> thing<00:02:25.520> we<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:25.820> talked<00:02:26.000> about

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
that ABS thing we just talked about

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.630 
that ABS thing we just talked about
maybe<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.770> very<00:02:28.100> very<00:02:28.460> small

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
maybe so it's on this very very small

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.760 
maybe so it's on this very very small
isolation<00:02:29.420> now<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.570> video<00:02:30.020> wires<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
isolation now the video wires to the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.830 
isolation now the video wires to the
camera<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:31.430> much<00:02:31.700> thicker<00:02:31.970> than<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.300> okay

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
camera but much thicker than that okay

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.720 
camera but much thicker than that okay
now<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.140> can<00:02:33.410> pry<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.740> off<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.190> guarantee

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
now I can pry that off but I guarantee

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.850 
now I can pry that off but I guarantee
I'm<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.120> gonna<00:02:35.270> get<00:02:35.420> these<00:02:35.570> wires<00:02:35.860> through

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
I'm not gonna get these wires through

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.640 
I'm not gonna get these wires through
that<00:02:37.070> little<00:02:37.520> itty<00:02:37.700> bitty<00:02:38.050> connector<00:02:39.050> so

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
that little itty bitty connector so

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.480 
that little itty bitty connector so
we're<00:02:39.770> gonna<00:02:39.860> have<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.040> come<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.340> a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
we're gonna have to come up with a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.130 
we're gonna have to come up with a
different<00:02:40.850> way<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> install<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.900> and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
different way to install this and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.920 
different way to install this and
connect<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.590> up<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:44.000> not<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.390> best<00:02:44.660> solution

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
connect it up it's not the best solution

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.010 
connect it up it's not the best solution
is<00:02:45.260> not<00:02:45.410> perfect<00:02:45.920> solution<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.550> it'll<00:02:46.820> work

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
is not perfect solution but it'll work

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.090 
is not perfect solution but it'll work
so<00:02:48.020> what<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.230> did<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.590> went<00:02:48.620> out<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:48.980> bought

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
so what I did is I went out and bought

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.010 
so what I did is I went out and bought
this<00:02:49.280> wire<00:02:49.910> wrap<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.450> everything<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:50.960> I'm

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
this wire wrap and everything so I'm

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.600 
this wire wrap and everything so I'm
going<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> use<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.740> route<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.070> wires<00:02:52.280> and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
going to use this to route the wires and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.130 
going to use this to route the wires and
the<00:02:52.790> wire<00:02:53.000> tie<00:02:53.270> them<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.780> edge<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.050> the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the wire tie them to the edge of the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.890 
the wire tie them to the edge of the
trunk<00:02:54.350> here<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:54.920> run<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.190> wires<00:02:55.400> through<00:02:55.730> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
trunk here and run the wires through it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.810 
trunk here and run the wires through it
from<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.960> rear<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.710> car<00:02:57.980> into<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.460> trunk

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
from the rear of the car into the trunk

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.020 
from the rear of the car into the trunk
and<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.630> hold<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.050> place<00:03:00.200> for<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.040> camera

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.790 

now<00:03:06.600> normally<00:03:06.990> need<00:03:07.170> two<00:03:07.290> inputs<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
now normally need two inputs to the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.440 
now normally need two inputs to the
camera<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:08.250> power<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.880> control<00:03:09.240> wider

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
camera one power and a control wider

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.490 
camera one power and a control wider
turning<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.110> off

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
turning on and off

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.290 
turning on and off
but<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.710> found<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.250> trailer<00:03:11.610> hitch<00:03:11.850> connector

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
but I found this trailer hitch connector

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.570 
but I found this trailer hitch connector
in<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> back<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.960> basically<00:03:13.400> sends<00:03:14.400> power

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
in the back that basically sends power

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.850 
in the back that basically sends power
to<00:03:14.850> your<00:03:14.970> backup<00:03:15.210> lights<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:16.290> turn<00:03:16.470> them<00:03:16.710> on

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
to your backup lights to turn them on

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.800 
to your backup lights to turn them on
when<00:03:17.100> your<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.580> have<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.880> trailer<00:03:18.150> attached<00:03:18.510> well

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
when your I have a trailer attached well

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.390 
when your I have a trailer attached well
that<00:03:18.930> same<00:03:19.140> thing<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.440> now<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.860> turn<00:03:20.220> on

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
that same thing is now going to turn on

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.710 
that same thing is now going to turn on
the<00:03:20.520> camera<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.060> don't<00:03:21.270> need<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.480> control

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the camera so I don't need to control

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.330 
the camera so I don't need to control
why<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.990> turn<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> camera<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:22.980> off<00:03:23.070> I'd

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
why to turn the camera on and off I'd

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.910 
why to turn the camera on and off I'd
simply<00:03:23.640> connect<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.060> up<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.330> power<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.680> did

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
simply connect this up to power so I did

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.130 
simply connect this up to power so I did
was<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.220> found<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.670> diagram<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.600> all<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.930> in

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
there's a tony instruction section of

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.160 
there's a tony instruction section of
the<00:03:31.530> manual<00:03:31.740> i<00:03:32.450> connected<00:03:33.450> up<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.690> wire<00:03:33.870> to

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the manual i connected up the wire to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.410 
the manual i connected up the wire to
the<00:03:34.350> proper<00:03:35.010> place<00:03:35.220> looking<00:03:35.610> at<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.850> diagram

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the proper place looking at this diagram

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.770 
the proper place looking at this diagram
and<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.350> simply<00:03:37.620> taped<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.360> now<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.690> I

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
and I simply taped it in so now when I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.080 
and I simply taped it in so now when I
put<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.140> car<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.680> reverse<00:03:40.730> its<00:03:41.730> going<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.970> go

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
let's wrap all this up I put this back

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.850 
let's wrap all this up I put this back
there<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.020> shove<00:03:46.260> back<00:03:46.530> into<00:03:46.770> the

installation<00:03:49.740> you<00:03:49.890> can't<00:03:50.190> even<00:03:50.310> see<00:03:50.550> it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
installation you can't even see it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.240 
installation you can't even see it
from<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.720> trunk<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.350> all<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.710> does<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.010> go<00:03:53.130> out

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
from the trunk and all it does is go out

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.950 
from the trunk and all it does is go out
to<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.490> wires<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:54.030> back<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.570> camera

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
to the wires going back to the camera

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.750 
to the wires going back to the camera
and<00:03:55.110> back<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.860> interior<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.670> car

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.580 

amount<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.629> camera<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.080> was<00:04:03.230> gonna<00:04:03.379> have<00:04:03.530> to

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
amount the camera I was gonna have to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.260 
amount the camera I was gonna have to
put<00:04:03.770> two<00:04:04.010> holes<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.489> mounting<00:04:04.520> it<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.090> one

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
put two holes for mounting it and one

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.970 
put two holes for mounting it and one
for<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.480> running<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.840> wires<00:04:06.080> but<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:06.920> took

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
for the running the wires but I took

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.559 
for the running the wires but I took
about<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.459> license<00:04:07.879> plate<00:04:08.180> light<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.540> I

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
about the license plate light and I

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:09.759 
about the license plate light and I
found<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.140> probably<00:04:09.260> wonder<00:04:09.620> why<00:04:09.739> I

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
found that I can probably wonder why I

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.020 
found that I can probably wonder why I
was<00:04:09.920> there<00:04:09.980> on<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.190> edge<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.550> this<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:10.970> don't

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
was there on the edge of this so I don't

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.199 
was there on the edge of this so I don't
have<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.330> drill<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.599> third<00:04:11.870> hole<00:04:12.879> so<00:04:13.879> now<00:04:14.120> you

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
have to drill that third hole so now you

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.060 
have to drill that third hole so now you
see<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.629> hole<00:04:14.810> wires<00:04:15.230> are<00:04:15.379> going<00:04:15.590> up<00:04:15.709> inside

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
see the hole wires are going up inside

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.500 
see the hole wires are going up inside
the<00:04:16.190> license<00:04:16.489> plate<00:04:16.669> light<00:04:16.850> area<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.329> there's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
the license plate light area and there's

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.900 
the license plate light area and there's
one<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.109> two<00:04:18.260> holes<00:04:18.470> drilled<00:04:18.769> for<00:04:18.979> 19<00:04:19.340> so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
one of the two holes drilled for 19 so

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.460 
one of the two holes drilled for 19 so
that's<00:04:20.090> how<00:04:20.209> we're<00:04:20.329> going<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.479> put<00:04:20.690> your<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
that's how we're going to put your the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.110 
that's how we're going to put your the
camera<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:21.919> here<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.760> should<00:04:22.880> work<00:04:23.060> just

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
camera in here and it should work just

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.390 
camera in here and it should work just
fine

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.250 

so<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.970> get<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.210> your<00:04:30.389> camera<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.050> back

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
so to get to your camera in the back

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.480 
so to get to your camera in the back
each<00:04:31.650> car<00:04:31.889> is<00:04:31.919> different<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:32.370> we've

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
each car is different but we've

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.760 
each car is different but we've
reinstalled<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.389> stereo<00:04:34.110> but<00:04:34.320> we<00:04:34.410> ran<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
reinstalled the stereo but we ran the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.469 
reinstalled the stereo but we ran the
car<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.310> wires<00:04:35.520> all<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.000> way<00:04:36.120> through<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
car the wires all the way through the

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.980 
car the wires all the way through the
center<00:04:36.750> console<00:04:37.199> here<00:04:37.470> back<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.840> past<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
center console here back to past the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.689 
center console here back to past the
brake<00:04:40.199> here<00:04:40.470> then<00:04:40.650> we<00:04:40.740> went<00:04:40.860> underneath<00:04:41.280> and

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
brake here then we went underneath and

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.670 
brake here then we went underneath and
exhibit<00:04:42.180> next<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.630> seat<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.560> then

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
exhibit next to the seat and then

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.890 
exhibit next to the seat and then
underneath<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.190> seat<00:04:44.520> down<00:04:45.030> here

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
underneath the seat down here

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.750 
underneath the seat down here
we<00:04:46.410> ran<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.740> wires<00:04:46.949> along<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.430> Ridge<00:04:47.729> here

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
we ran the wires along this Ridge here

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.760 
we ran the wires along this Ridge here
there's<00:04:48.510> a<00:04:48.570> little<00:04:48.810> channel<00:04:49.080> inside<00:04:49.470> there

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
there's a little channel inside there

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.800 
there's a little channel inside there
you<00:04:50.010> can<00:04:50.130> also<00:04:50.280> lift<00:04:50.580> up<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.970> side<00:04:51.150> here<00:04:51.600> where

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
you can also lift up the side here where

find that there's of course another door

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.909 
find that there's of course another door
channel<00:05:00.870> there<00:05:01.110> as<00:05:01.260> well<00:05:01.470> where<00:05:01.680> all<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
channel there as well where all the

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.070 
channel there as well where all the
wires<00:05:02.100> go<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:03.090> just<00:05:03.210> follow<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.570> existing

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
wires go you just follow the existing

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.110 
wires go you just follow the existing
paths<00:05:04.289> path<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.100> wiring<00:05:05.430> in<00:05:05.490> your<00:05:05.610> car<00:05:05.850> and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
paths path of the wiring in your car and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.000 
paths path of the wiring in your car and
you<00:05:06.840> look<00:05:06.990> if<00:05:07.169> we<00:05:07.260> take<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.440> little<00:05:07.680> peek<00:05:07.830> here

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
you look if we take a little peek here

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.350 
you look if we take a little peek here
you<00:05:08.130> see<00:05:08.310> there's<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.580> little<00:05:08.970> opening<00:05:09.060> there

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
you see there's a little opening there

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.300 
you see there's a little opening there
and<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.660> goes<00:05:09.780> right<00:05:10.020> back<00:05:10.229> out<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.530> your<00:05:10.800> trunk

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
and it goes right back out to your trunk

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.820 
and it goes right back out to your trunk
area<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:12.479> that's<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.870> where<00:05:13.169> we're<00:05:13.350> at<00:05:13.470> here<00:05:13.740> is

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
area and that's a where we're at here is

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.830 
area and that's a where we're at here is
that<00:05:14.039> that's<00:05:14.460> where<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.789> old<00:05:14.970> connection<00:05:15.720> was

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
that that's where the old connection was

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.689 
that that's where the old connection was
then<00:05:16.020> there's<00:05:16.229> our<00:05:16.410> wiring<00:05:16.680> coming<00:05:17.190> out<00:05:17.340> there

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
then there's our wiring coming out there

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.420 
then there's our wiring coming out there
and<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.690> comes<00:05:18.900> across<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.470> edge<00:05:19.650> there<00:05:19.979> back

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
and it comes across the edge there back

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.040 
and it comes across the edge there back
up<00:05:20.639> here<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:20.910> we've<00:05:21.240> attached<00:05:21.690> it<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:21.870> the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
up here and we've attached it to the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.110 
up here and we've attached it to the
back<00:05:22.199> of<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.470> trunk<00:05:22.740> hooked<00:05:23.460> up<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.729> camera

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
back of the trunk hooked up the camera

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.060 
back of the trunk hooked up the camera
to<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:24.840> right<00:05:25.350> through<00:05:25.590> here<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:25.860> where

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
to it and right through here is where

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.760 
to it and right through here is where
the<00:05:26.190> camera<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.639> at<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.570> if<00:05:27.690> we<00:05:27.840> take<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.470> trunk

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
the camera is at so if we take the trunk

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.580 
the camera is at so if we take the trunk
here<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.190> we<00:05:29.280> pull<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> down<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:30.320> we'll<00:05:31.320> see

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
here and we pull it down and we'll see

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.460 
here and we pull it down and we'll see
the<00:05:32.340> camera<00:05:32.850> mounted<00:05:33.180> right<00:05:33.360> there<00:05:33.630> on<00:05:33.930> the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
the camera mounted right there on the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
the camera mounted right there on the
light<00:05:35.280> assembly<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:36.150> we're<00:05:36.539> good<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.810> go

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.980 

we<00:05:43.639> are<00:05:43.789> you<00:05:43.880> can<00:05:43.970> see<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.210> videos<00:05:44.539> installed

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
we are you can see the videos installed

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.719 
we are you can see the videos installed
instead<00:05:45.410> of<00:05:45.530> all<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.740> connections<00:05:46.250> on<00:05:46.400> it<00:05:46.580> so

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
instead of all the connections on it so

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.279 
instead of all the connections on it so
let's<00:05:46.970> go<00:05:47.060> ahead<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.270> back<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.690> car<00:05:47.930> up<00:05:48.110> and

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
let's go ahead and back the car up and

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.379 
let's go ahead and back the car up and
everything<00:05:48.710> there<00:05:49.160> goes<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.639> camera<00:05:50.120> and

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
everything there goes the camera and

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.510 
everything there goes the camera and
sure<00:05:50.690> enough<00:05:50.990> we<00:05:51.110> can<00:05:51.259> see<00:05:51.410> out<00:05:51.560> feeds<00:05:52.400> a

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
sure enough we can see out feeds a

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.890 
sure enough we can see out feeds a
little<00:05:52.699> bit<00:05:52.789> of<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:52.910> horizontal<00:05:53.180> adjustment

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
little bit of a horizontal adjustment

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.450 
little bit of a horizontal adjustment
here<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.139> we<00:05:54.229> have<00:05:54.349> to<00:05:54.410> go<00:05:54.560> change<00:05:55.130> that<00:05:55.190> angle

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
here so we have to go change that angle

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.580 
here so we have to go change that angle
back<00:05:55.789> there<00:05:56.030> but<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:56.960> can<00:05:57.110> see<00:05:57.199> you<00:05:57.289> can<00:05:57.440> see

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
back there but you can see you can see

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.809 
back there but you can see you can see
the<00:05:57.680> markings<00:05:58.130> and<00:05:58.340> everything<00:05:58.699> they're

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
the markings and everything they're

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.969 
the markings and everything they're
built<00:05:59.000> into<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.300> camera<00:05:59.509> so<00:05:59.720> you<00:05:59.900> can<00:06:00.050> see<00:06:00.470> how

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
built into the camera so you can see how

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.110 
built into the camera so you can see how
far<00:06:01.160> you<00:06:01.310> have<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.490> go<00:06:01.729> up<00:06:01.789> while<00:06:01.940> you're

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
far you have to go up while you're

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.689 
far you have to go up while you're
backing<00:06:02.479> up<00:06:02.569> so<00:06:03.560> they<00:06:03.770> let's<00:06:03.949> do<00:06:04.160> now<00:06:04.340> is<00:06:04.580> to

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
backing up so they let's do now is to

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.939 
backing up so they let's do now is to
