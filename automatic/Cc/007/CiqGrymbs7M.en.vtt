00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.200
 First of all 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.530
 Shake hand grip 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.070
 You grip in two of grip 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.070
 At the time of serving 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.610
 Finger 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.610
 Behind you 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.420
 Make your wrists easy to hear 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 Tatsusuke department players 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.510
 When you hit a serve 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.510
 Usual 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.850
 Yg serve 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.850
 not 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.060
 In case of g or player 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.570
 yg serve 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.570
 + 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.140
 Passing Europe 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.160
 From above 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.160
 I will apply 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.330
 g When hitting a serve, your wrist and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.740
 Child movement 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 Wrist movement and day 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.170
 To do 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.310
 From the top of the player 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.720
 After swinging down 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 hit yg serve 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.220
 Wintering 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 Shoulder height 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.110
 Swing down 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.020
 Yg serve after dropping into 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.380
 I am 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.420
 this 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.110
 Shake down 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.640
 But why 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.240
 Here is a part of sake 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 Serve day 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.479
 By swinging down 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.860
 The action when you go out will be faster 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.140
 Swung down 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.460
 reaction 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.460
 Recoil a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.530
 It takes a lot of rotation 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.060
 Elder brother 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 Articles only 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.110
 From yg serve 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.599
 It is better since the swing-down 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.850
 Because the reaction of this racket can be used 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.549
 Can cut strongly 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.200
 When Zhang Jike players hit the yg Saab 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.910
 About the racket from above 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.250
 I'm hitting the second serve 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.250
 In this strongly broken rotation 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.990
 In the Olympic final 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.800
 Strongly cut my g- third turn day 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.650
 When Wang Hao players to receive 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.850
 Net miss 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.330
 I am 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:04.980
 Strongly terribly much throughout your entire home players resulting in a net miss 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.980
 It is characterized by being out 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:24.620
 yg serve is a pretty powerful weapon 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.340
 By all means strong rotation can be applied 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.620
 As you shake the ig Now 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.069
 Please try to get 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.069
 Poop 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.330
 It is recommended
