 between new sequel grand theft auto 5 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.660
 for the playstation 4 at the boot and me 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.040
 I thought we are straight 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.990
 gambling in online mode 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.090
 you see that my online character is me 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.530
 Incidentally, did not change further 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.470
 I always thought I'll show you 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.880
 with new the new passive mode because it 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.440
 simply random is itself arbitrary 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.060
 know just about trying it because 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.349
 Let's just do it 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.719
 yes, I'm here with christ, by the way 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.319
 while the service is running from now on there 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.589
 over there and how I have to watch that 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:42.879
 here are no radio vp radio stations are out 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.280
 already underbody lighting on 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.479
 is still in red is the same again 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.579
 another video, anyway, the new one 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:54.749
 passive mode you're practically pushing that 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:57.219
 let in touchpad then happens 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.510
 and i think that's just chris now 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.559
 with Christ is only with me that 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.940
 I'm unsure okay then I'll show you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.539
 okay I'll show it to christa sees 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.060
 get it right if a passive mode 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.950
 activated this is the new feature on the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.799
 next version of grand theft auto 5 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.539
 then the one becomes invisible practically 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.600
 yes, even as transparent as 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.299
 maybe knows from the race 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.649
 this non contact this no contact 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.600
 this is not a contact function yes quite 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.770
 you can see with yes and if you 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 Now he practically on his motorcycle 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.750
 ascends dennis r and his motorcycle 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.759
 completely transparent yes no one can do it 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.229
 somehow drive around because company like that 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.479
 problem that people just give you 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.490
 knocked over and cars and stuff like that 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.200
 happens modestly like mindless and here 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.390
 is you are completely transparent is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.039
 practically just like a ghost of 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.850
 here around randy and when he descends now 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.740
 then the motorcycle is visible again 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.619
 practically so here could damage 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.829
 but as soon as he rises then he is 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.420
