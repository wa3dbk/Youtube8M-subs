did<00:00:24.710> was<00:00:25.130> test<00:00:26.060> my<00:00:26.270> battery<00:00:27.970> what<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.000> want<00:00:29.300> to

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
did was test my battery what I want to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.830 
did was test my battery what I want to
do<00:00:29.539> there<00:00:29.990> is<00:00:30.460> what<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.490> first<00:00:31.760> did<00:00:31.970> was<00:00:32.270> trickle

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.360 
do there is what I first did was trickle
charge<00:00:33.110> it<00:00:33.410> overnight<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.550> it<00:00:35.150> came<00:00:35.420> up<00:00:35.660> to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
charge it overnight and it came up to

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.150 
charge it overnight and it came up to
measuring<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.489> healthy<00:00:38.210> 12<00:00:38.630> volts<00:00:39.200> but<00:00:39.530> it

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
measuring a healthy 12 volts but it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.950 
measuring a healthy 12 volts but it
turned<00:00:40.370> out<00:00:40.550> when<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:40.760> took<00:00:40.880> it<00:00:41.149> to<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.329> auto

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
turned out when I took it to the auto

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.229 
turned out when I took it to the auto
parts<00:00:42.410> store<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:43.070> measure<00:00:43.310> the<00:00:43.579> cold<00:00:43.850> cranking

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
parts store to measure the cold cranking

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.049 
parts store to measure the cold cranking
amps<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.870> was<00:00:45.079> way<00:00:45.980> below<00:00:46.190> what<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:46.760> needed<00:00:46.940> to

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
amps it was way below what it needed to

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.660 
amps it was way below what it needed to
be<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:48.950> about<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.280> only<00:00:49.340> way<00:00:49.520> you

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
be and I that's about the only way you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.209 
be and I that's about the only way you
can<00:00:49.850> tell<00:00:50.120> unless<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.230> have<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.380> special<00:00:51.680> meter

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
can tell unless you have a special meter

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.130 
can tell unless you have a special meter
and<00:00:52.610> those<00:00:52.969> are<00:00:53.239> hundred<00:00:54.170> dollars<00:00:54.530> or<00:00:54.770> more<00:00:56.140> so

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
and those are hundred dollars or more so

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.410 
and those are hundred dollars or more so
you<00:00:57.800> got<00:00:57.950> fresh<00:00:58.219> battery<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.940> and<00:01:01.270> then<00:01:02.270> you

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
you got fresh battery in and then you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.359 
you got fresh battery in and then you
want<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.690> determine<00:01:03.079> if<00:01:03.469> your<00:01:03.770> starter<00:01:04.309> is

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
want to determine if your starter is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.609 
want to determine if your starter is
good<00:01:04.609> or<00:01:04.759> not<00:01:04.789> the<00:01:05.509> easiest<00:01:05.899> way<00:01:06.139> to<00:01:06.170> do<00:01:06.409> that

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
good or not the easiest way to do that

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.059 
good or not the easiest way to do that
is<00:01:07.039> too<00:01:07.369> short<00:01:07.939> or<00:01:08.270> jump<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.259> two<00:01:09.649> main

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
is too short or jump the two main

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.190 
is too short or jump the two main
connectors<00:01:10.639> this<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.149> old<00:01:11.329> solenoid<00:01:12.020> you

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
connectors this is the old solenoid you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.919 
connectors this is the old solenoid you
got<00:01:12.350> two<00:01:12.590> main<00:01:13.509> connectors<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:14.719> then<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
got two main connectors and then the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.370 
got two main connectors and then the
small<00:01:15.229> one<00:01:15.529> and<00:01:15.740> if<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.459> get<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.380> jumper

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
small one and if you get the jumper

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.109 
small one and if you get the jumper
cables<00:01:18.409> out<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.100> your<00:01:19.219> car<00:01:19.459> or<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:19.939> could<00:01:20.090> just

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
cables out of your car or you could just

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.120 
cables out of your car or you could just
put<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> screwdriver<00:01:21.319> in<00:01:21.679> there<00:01:21.799> but<00:01:21.979> it's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
put a screwdriver in there but it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.789 
put a screwdriver in there but it's
really<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:22.670> mounted<00:01:23.420> underneath<00:01:23.749> here<00:01:24.649> so

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
really it's mounted underneath here so

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.379 
really it's mounted underneath here so
it's<00:01:25.100> kind<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.549> difficult<00:01:25.789> to<00:01:26.209> get<00:01:26.329> a

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
it's kind of difficult to get a

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.620 
it's kind of difficult to get a
screwdriver<00:01:26.929> in<00:01:27.319> there<00:01:27.560> safely<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.759> can<00:01:29.509> be

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
screwdriver in there safely it can be

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.980 
screwdriver in there safely it can be
done<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:30.170> I'd<00:01:31.069> say<00:01:31.310> it'd<00:01:31.429> be<00:01:31.939> easier<00:01:32.389> to<00:01:32.689> use

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
done but I'd say it'd be easier to use

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.489 
done but I'd say it'd be easier to use
the<00:01:33.289> jumper<00:01:33.920> cables<00:01:33.950> on<00:01:34.429> your<00:01:34.579> car<00:01:34.819> and<00:01:35.499> once

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
the jumper cables on your car and once

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:37.239 
the jumper cables on your car and once
you<00:01:36.619> do<00:01:36.770> that

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
you do that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.120 
you do that
turn<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.759> key<00:01:37.999> you<00:01:38.659> get<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.899> healthy<00:01:39.679> sounding

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
turn the key you get a healthy sounding

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.489 
turn the key you get a healthy sounding
starter<00:01:40.969> then<00:01:41.209> you<00:01:41.329> know<00:01:41.479> for<00:01:41.779> sure<00:01:41.810> your

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
starter then you know for sure your

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.230 
starter then you know for sure your
starter<00:01:42.979> is<00:01:43.039> good<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.609> it's<00:01:43.759> got<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:44.029> be<00:01:44.090> your

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
starter is good and it's got to be your

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.679 
starter is good and it's got to be your
solenoid<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.609> what<00:01:46.609> we<00:01:46.729> did<00:01:46.909> was<00:01:47.119> we<00:01:47.179> got<00:01:47.479> an

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
solenoid so what we did was we got an

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.739 
solenoid so what we did was we got an
aftermarket<00:01:48.169> solenoid<00:01:48.950> on<00:01:49.159> Amazon<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.509> was

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
aftermarket solenoid on Amazon it was

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.289 
aftermarket solenoid on Amazon it was
only<00:01:50.929> seventeen<00:01:51.529> dollars<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.789> turns<00:01:53.029> out

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
only seventeen dollars and it turns out

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.469 
only seventeen dollars and it turns out
it<00:01:53.450> fits<00:01:53.749> all<00:01:54.020> Polaris<00:01:55.009> ATVs<00:01:55.729> except<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
it fits all Polaris ATVs except the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.159 
it fits all Polaris ATVs except the
expedition<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.569> so<00:01:59.569> we<00:01:59.659> started<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:00.139> with

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.169 
expedition and so we started out with

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.059 
expedition and so we started out with
the<00:02:00.380> new<00:02:00.560> one

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
the new one

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.649 
the new one
I<00:02:01.099> noticed<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.669> could<00:02:01.819> get<00:02:01.939> some<00:02:02.119> used<00:02:02.359> ones

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
I noticed you could get some used ones

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.159 
I noticed you could get some used ones
on<00:02:02.869> eBay<00:02:03.319> but<00:02:04.069> they<00:02:04.729> turned<00:02:05.149> out<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.359> be<00:02:05.599> about

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.169 
on eBay but they turned out to be about

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:08.770 
on eBay but they turned out to be about
twice<00:02:06.560> as<00:02:06.829> much<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.459> you're<00:02:08.330> only<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.720> to

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
twice as much and you're only going to

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.089 
twice as much and you're only going to
get

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
get

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.580

maybe<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:09.939> to<00:02:10.119> lie<00:02:10.299> for<00:02:10.359> less<00:02:10.810> out<00:02:11.079> of<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.319> used

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
maybe have to lie for less out of a used

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.759 
maybe have to lie for less out of a used
one<00:02:11.980> because<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:13.030> think<00:02:13.299> these<00:02:14.230> things<00:02:14.590> just

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
one because I think these things just

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.209 
one because I think these things just
wear<00:02:15.040> out<00:02:15.069> over<00:02:15.280> time<00:02:15.639> so<00:02:16.889> what<00:02:17.889> you<00:02:17.980> want<00:02:18.129> to

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
wear out over time so what you want to

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.280 
wear out over time so what you want to
do<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.549> take<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.879> off<00:02:19.030> first<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.749> take<00:02:20.049> these

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
do to take it off first is take these

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.699 
do to take it off first is take these
connectors<00:02:21.219> off<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:22.269> would<00:02:22.689> be<00:02:22.959> good<00:02:23.139> idea<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
connectors off it would be good idea to

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.589 
connectors off it would be good idea to
disconnect<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.549> positive<00:02:25.060> lead<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.420> your
