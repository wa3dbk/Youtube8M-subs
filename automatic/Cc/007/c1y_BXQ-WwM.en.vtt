00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
been disappointing season for them

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.919 
been disappointing season for them
overall<00:00:29.400> they've<00:00:30.150> got<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> great<00:00:30.449> passing<00:00:30.810> game

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
overall they've got a great passing game

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.120 
overall they've got a great passing game
obviously<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.500> they've<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.740> bunch<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
obviously but they've got a bunch of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
obviously but they've got a bunch of
injuries<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.059> offense<00:00:33.809> including<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
injuries on offense including in the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
injuries on offense including in the
running<00:00:34.649> game<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:34.980> might<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.309> been<00:00:35.340> part

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
running game which might have been part

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.979 
running game which might have been part
of<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> reason<00:00:36.210> their<00:00:36.329> passing<00:00:36.630> game<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.870> so

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of the reason their passing game was so

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
of the reason their passing game was so
great<00:00:37.230> during<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> year<00:00:37.890> also<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
great during the year also they have a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
great during the year also they have a
ton<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> turmoil<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.629> their<00:00:39.750> coaching<00:00:40.170> staff

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379

but<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.770> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.690> down<00:00:42.690> season

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

nothing<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.009> than<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.460> monkey<00:01:29.700> off

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
nothing more than to get that monkey off

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.160 
the back yeah i think if the between the
two<00:01:32.549> teams<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:33.299> agree<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> i<00:01:34.140> think

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
two teams i agree with you i think

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
two teams i agree with you i think

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
troubles me a bit because northwestern

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210 
troubles me a bit because northwestern
specifically<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.560> done<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.130> they

specifically is not done well and they

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.319 
specifically is not done well and they
haven't<00:01:50.430> been<00:01:50.490> able<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.759> run<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> ball<00:01:51.030> well

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
haven't been able to run the ball well

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
haven't been able to run the ball well
and<00:01:51.360> they've<00:01:51.570> done<00:01:51.750> well<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.380> but

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and they've done well when they have but

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100 
and they've done well when they have but
still<00:01:53.070> overall<00:01:53.430> 10<00:01:54.090> points<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.810> points

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
still overall 10 points a lot of points

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
still overall 10 points a lot of points
and<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.799> general<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.579> general<00:01:56.909> vibe

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and just in general the the general vibe

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.490 
and just in general the the general vibe
of<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.360> game<00:01:57.570> i'm<00:01:57.719> thinking<00:01:57.990> northwestern

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
of this game i'm thinking northwestern

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
of this game i'm thinking northwestern
might<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.009> bet<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.340> we'll<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.700> yeah

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
might be a good bet here we'll see yeah

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
might be a good bet here we'll see yeah
one<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:01.049> thing<00:02:01.170> I'll<00:02:01.259> add<00:02:01.290> puter<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.250> my

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
one one thing I'll add puter is that my

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.060 
one one thing I'll add puter is that my
simulator<00:02:03.270> does<00:02:03.450> show<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.070> northwestern

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
simulator does show that northwestern

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
simulator does show that northwestern
will<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.700> successful<00:02:06.090> through<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> air<00:02:06.869> again

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
will be successful through the air again

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.380 
will be successful through the air again
you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.580> talk<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:08.940> play-action

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you know as we talk about play-action

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.860 
you know as we talk about play-action
pass<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.959> critical<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.679> these<00:02:11.340> matchups<00:02:11.640> right

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
pass is critical in these matchups right

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.449 
pass is critical in these matchups right
it<00:02:12.930> shows<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.349> they're<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.769> get<00:02:13.920> 88<00:02:14.430> a

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it shows that they're going to get 88 a

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.850 
it shows that they're going to get 88 a
half<00:02:14.760> net<00:02:15.269> passing<00:02:15.840> yards<00:02:16.080> per<00:02:16.140> attempt<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
half net passing yards per attempt and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.339 
half net passing yards per attempt and
when<00:02:17.010> am<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.730> allowed<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.540> their<00:02:18.870> own<00:02:19.019> one

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
when am is allowed that their own one

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.649 
when am is allowed that their own one
this<00:02:19.560> season<00:02:19.830> oh<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.150> last<00:02:21.299> three

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
this season oh and for the last three

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.000 
this season oh and for the last three
seasons<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.349> three<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.370> 16<00:02:24.030> since<00:02:24.720> 1992<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.980> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
seasons and three and 16 since 1992 so I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.190 
seasons and three and 16 since 1992 so I
think<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.480> if<00:02:27.480> you're<00:02:27.599> watching<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.989> game

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
think that if you're watching the game

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.110 
think that if you're watching the game
or<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.709> northwestern<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.579> achieve

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
or you think northwestern can achieve

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.680 
or you think northwestern can achieve
that<00:02:30.329> then<00:02:30.390> obviously<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:31.230> that's<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.500> pretty
