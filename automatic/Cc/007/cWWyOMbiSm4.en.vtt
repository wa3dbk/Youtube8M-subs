important in season 5 as with everything

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.070 
important in season 5 as with everything
I<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:22.949> I'll<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.789> over<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> actual<00:00:24.539> changes

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I do I'll go over the actual changes

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
I do I'll go over the actual changes
first<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.800> then<00:00:25.920> I'll<00:00:26.039> tell<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.640> they

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
first and then I'll tell you what they

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.519 
first and then I'll tell you what they
actually<00:00:26.939> mean<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.990> impact<00:00:28.380> they're

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
actually mean and what impact they're

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.509 
actually mean and what impact they're
likely<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.890> have

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
likely to have

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.310 
likely to have
so<00:00:29.699> let's<00:00:29.880> start<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> dragon<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
so let's start with the dragon and I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.959 
so let's start with the dragon and I
picked<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.769> first<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> actually

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
picked this first because I actually

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.060 
picked this first because I actually
think<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> most<00:00:33.780> important<00:00:34.410> change<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
think it's the most important change of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.370 
think it's the most important change of
all<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> objectives<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> three<00:00:37.200> main

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
all of the objectives now the three main

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
all of the objectives now the three main
things<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.040> changed<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.969> screen

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
things that have changed are on screen

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
things that have changed are on screen
so<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> doesn't<00:00:40.110> grant<00:00:40.290> gold<00:00:40.620> anymore<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so it doesn't grant gold anymore but it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
so it doesn't grant gold anymore but it
gives<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> certain<00:00:42.450> buff<00:00:42.660> instead<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
gives you a certain buff instead and it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.040 
gives you a certain buff instead and it
also<00:00:44.040> attacks<00:00:44.520> AoE<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.450> cone<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:45.809> shape

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
also attacks AoE in a cone like shape

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
also attacks AoE in a cone like shape
meaning<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:47.430> does<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.969> more

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
meaning that it actually does way more

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
meaning that it actually does way more
damage<00:00:48.629> especially<00:00:49.020> early<00:00:49.770> into<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> game

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
damage especially early into the game

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
damage especially early into the game
the<00:00:51.000> reason<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.420> mentioned<00:00:51.870> especially<00:00:52.050> early

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the reason I mentioned especially early

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
the reason I mentioned especially early
is<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.300> taking<00:00:54.719> dragons

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is because you want to be taking dragons

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
is because you want to be taking dragons
earlier<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.280> stack<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.730> your

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
earlier now so you can stack up your

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.479 
earlier now so you can stack up your
busts<00:00:57.030> faster<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> mean<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.949> every

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
busts faster so what I mean is every

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
busts faster so what I mean is every
time<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.850> kill<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> dragon<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.899> another

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
time you kill the dragon you get another

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
time you kill the dragon you get another
buff<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.829> slightly<00:01:02.129> different<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.879> it'll

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
buff that's slightly different and it'll

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
buff that's slightly different and it'll
be<00:01:03.690> no<00:01:03.899> surprise<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:05.010> times<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
be no surprise that the more times you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
be no surprise that the more times you
kill<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.119> better<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> buffs<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.110> at

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
kill it the better the buffs get at

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320 
kill it the better the buffs get at
helping<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> end<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> game<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> first

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
actually do it is gonna double all your

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually do it is gonna double all your
other<00:01:28.380> bonuses<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> your<00:01:29.520> attacks<00:01:29.820> burn<00:01:30.090> your

enemies for 150 true damage over three

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
enemies for 150 true damage over three
seconds<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.290> red<00:01:34.590> buff

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
seconds so it's kind of like a red buff

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
seconds so it's kind of like a red buff
now<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.549> buff<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> pretty<00:01:36.270> big<00:01:36.540> help

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
without Baron it actually means you can

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.720 
without Baron it actually means you can
pick<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> fire<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.470> still<00:03:13.799> win<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.310> gives<00:03:14.609> you

pick a fire and still win it gives you

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.699

that chance to come back and not just

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.469 
that chance to come back and not just

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:18.479 
have to sit there afraid to fight and

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.559 
have to sit there afraid to fight and
wait<00:03:18.900> out<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.260> buff<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:20.280> final<00:03:20.639> change<00:03:20.909> is<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
wait out the buff the final change is to

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.300 
wait out the buff the final change is to
towers<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.349> what<00:03:22.590> they've<00:03:22.709> done<00:03:22.889> is<00:03:23.129> they've

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
towers and what they've done is they've

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.789 
towers and what they've done is they've
given<00:03:23.609> each<00:03:23.879> row<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.510> towers<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.959> new<00:03:25.260> passive

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
given each row of towers a new passive

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.039 
given each row of towers a new passive
the<00:03:26.250> first<00:03:26.489> set<00:03:26.729> of<00:03:26.760> towers<00:03:27.299> takes<00:03:27.629> reduced

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
the first set of towers takes reduced

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.629 
the first set of towers takes reduced
damage<00:03:28.260> from<00:03:28.590> champions<00:03:29.099> for<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.430> first

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
damage from champions for the first

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.219 
damage from champions for the first
seven<00:03:30.060> minutes<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.599> game<00:03:30.930> which<00:03:31.199> is

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
seven minutes of the game which is

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.289 
seven minutes of the game which is
actually<00:03:31.829> already<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.699> the<00:03:32.729> game<00:03:33.090> right

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
actually already there in the game right

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.689 
actually already there in the game right
now<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:33.569> there's<00:03:34.139> no<00:03:34.290> change<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:35.220> next<00:03:35.549> set

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
now so there's no change the next set

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.539 
now so there's no change the next set
the<00:03:35.729> inner<00:03:36.120> towers<00:03:36.690> has<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.349> 200<00:03:37.979> health<00:03:38.159> shield

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the inner towers has a 200 health shield

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.819 
the inner towers has a 200 health shield
that<00:03:38.760> regenerates<00:03:39.269> after<00:03:39.780> 30<00:03:40.019> seconds<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.739> it

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
that regenerates after 30 seconds of it

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.710 
that regenerates after 30 seconds of it
not<00:03:41.010> being<00:03:41.069> attacked<00:03:41.639> now<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.479> tower

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
not being attacked now if the tower

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.750 
not being attacked now if the tower
actually<00:03:42.989> has<00:03:43.409> any<00:03:43.709> part<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.459> shield

actually has any part of that shield

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.939 
actually has any part of that shield
left<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.269> also<00:03:45.599> grants<00:03:45.989> nearby<00:03:46.500> allied

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
left it also grants nearby allied

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.339 
left it also grants nearby allied
champions<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.760> shield<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.180> increases<00:03:48.870> by<00:03:49.019> 30

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
champions a shield that increases by 30

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.099 
champions a shield that increases by 30
every<00:03:49.859> second<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.489> 300<00:03:51.359> this<00:03:51.810> makes

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
every second up to 300 this makes

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.599 
every second up to 300 this makes
actually<00:03:52.409> seeding<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.159> pushing<00:03:53.519> these

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
actually seeding and pushing these

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.670 
actually seeding and pushing these
towers<00:03:53.909> down<00:03:54.299> pretty<00:03:54.840> hard<00:03:55.169> because<00:03:55.379> it's

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
towers down pretty hard because it's

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.860 
towers down pretty hard because it's
much<00:03:55.919> easier<00:03:56.159> to<00:03:56.400> defend<00:03:56.819> it's<00:03:57.269> harder<00:03:57.720> to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
much easier to defend it's harder to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.509 
much easier to defend it's harder to
dive<00:03:58.109> with<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.530> shield<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.099> it's<00:03:59.340> also

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
dive with that shield and it's also

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.610 
dive with that shield and it's also
harder<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.120> be<00:04:00.269> poked<00:04:00.540> away<00:04:00.689> from<00:04:01.169> because<00:04:01.500> it

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
harder to be poked away from because it

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.770 
harder to be poked away from because it
obviously<00:04:01.709> regenerates<00:04:02.459> over<00:04:02.729> time<00:04:02.970> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
obviously regenerates over time the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.229 
obviously regenerates over time the
final<00:04:04.139> set<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.319> towers<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.040> inhib<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.760> Nexus

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
final set of towers the inhib and Nexus

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.089 
final set of towers the inhib and Nexus
turrets<00:04:06.599> have<00:04:06.750> been<00:04:06.900> completely<00:04:07.560> reworked

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
turrets have been completely reworked

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.679 
turrets have been completely reworked
they're<00:04:08.340> completely<00:04:08.909> different<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.449> how<00:04:09.540> they

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
they're completely different to how they

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.899 
they're completely different to how they
are<00:04:09.840> now<00:04:10.049> they<00:04:10.500> actually<00:04:10.799> fire<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.250> constant

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
are now they actually fire a constant

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.300 
are now they actually fire a constant
laser<00:04:12.150> kind<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.259> how<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.590> fountain

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
laser kind of like how the fountain

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.279 
laser kind of like how the fountain
works<00:04:14.549> now<00:04:14.909> but<00:04:15.269> obviously<00:04:15.659> it's<00:04:15.870> not<00:04:15.900> quite

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
works now but obviously it's not quite

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.170 
works now but obviously it's not quite
as<00:04:16.380> much<00:04:16.620> damage<00:04:16.889> whoever<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.729> laser<00:04:17.909> is

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
as much damage whoever the laser is

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.149 
as much damage whoever the laser is
actually<00:04:18.659> hitting<00:04:18.900> has<00:04:19.349> their<00:04:19.620> damage<00:04:19.979> and

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
actually hitting has their damage and

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.800 
actually hitting has their damage and
movement<00:04:20.430> speed<00:04:20.519> reduced<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.389> it's<00:04:21.510> kind<00:04:21.750> of

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
movement speed reduced so it's kind of

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.839 
movement speed reduced so it's kind of
hard<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.049> dive<00:04:22.320> as<00:04:22.529> well<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.460> really

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
hard to dive as well this is really

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.240 
hard to dive as well this is really
aimed<00:04:24.240> though<00:04:24.570> at<00:04:24.870> stopping<00:04:25.289> split-pushing

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
aimed though at stopping split-pushing

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.250 
aimed though at stopping split-pushing
and<00:04:26.340> diving<00:04:26.700> on<00:04:26.970> your<00:04:27.120> own<00:04:27.270> not<00:04:27.630> really<00:04:27.870> diving

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
and diving on your own not really diving

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.560 
and diving on your own not really diving
as<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.410> team<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.490> can't<00:04:29.790> be<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> Zed<00:04:30.330> or<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
as a team like you can't be a Zed or a

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.200 
as a team like you can't be a Zed or a
ribbon<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.290> just<00:04:31.350> sit<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.040> silane<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.670> dive

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
ribbon and just sit in a silane and dive

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.330 
ribbon and just sit in a silane and dive
anymore<00:04:33.510> but<00:04:34.020> diving<00:04:34.320> as<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.560> team<00:04:34.920> where<00:04:35.250> you

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
anymore but diving as a team where you

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.460 
anymore but diving as a team where you
get<00:04:35.550> your<00:04:35.670> tank<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.240> absorb<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.810> laser<00:04:37.020> is

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
get your tank to absorb the laser is

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.710 
get your tank to absorb the laser is
still<00:04:37.830> going<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.040> be<00:04:38.100> possible<00:04:38.640> so<00:04:39.270> those<00:04:39.480> are

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
still going to be possible so those are

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.810 
still going to be possible so those are
the<00:04:39.810> three<00:04:40.170> big<00:04:40.470> changes<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.190> objectives<00:04:41.670> in

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
the three big changes to objectives in

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.220 
the three big changes to objectives in
the<00:04:41.910> preseason<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.900> hope<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.110> guys

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
the preseason and I hope you guys
