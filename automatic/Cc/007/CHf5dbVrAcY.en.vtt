00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how I am 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.269
 I grow jimenez and on capillary 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:18.510
 mats this from and i try 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:24.890
 first year because the correction is big 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:29.609
 and need to somehow keep up with watering and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:35.160
 just what a jimenez do not like strong 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.370
 overdrying and worse start 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.620
 develop and bloom depends on well 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 formed sheet mass than she 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 more the better bloom love I decided 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 try capillary mat that order 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.940
 capillary magician means himself from 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 is just such a thing 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:05.570
 collected state he watches from two 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.570
 parts below is such here 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.860
 material of the type of padding polyester which is good 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.820
 absorbs water now it's wet a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.670
 covered with a film like this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:28.799
 black which is all small 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.189
 hole and looking for it lets air 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.750
 meaning what pot when put on 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.530
 this magician he would press and with his weight 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.710
 I slowly absorbs water very 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.290
 happy with this first year of use 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:52.470
 because it is convenient it is fast and with 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.000
 watering and jimenez perspectives are very 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.140
 develops well here with me 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.939
 worth a small part of the collection which 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 still just bloom before flowering 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.590
 keeping them on the mats can of course it would be 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.929
 and keep us from the window just 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.930
 uncomfortable 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:15.330
 because I want to arrange beautifully 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.410
 already either you bloom she womb not 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.129
 put in piles 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 it's not very convenient here we take 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.780
 let's say one kind of plant for 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.830
 examples wanted to show for example only 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:35.040
 water bloomed in my first year first year 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.709
 growing 1 rhizome is a sort of king of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.989
 windsor 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.720
 huge large flower well 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.360
 shaped bush here are two leaves 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.819
 from the sun damaged and so here it is 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.930
 generally excellent and in what way 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.019
 proof that we like 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.900
 this is a look at the root here here 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.900
 good drain hole needed 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.379
 film and get up so that it was visible here 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.540
 the roots have even crept through the drainage costs 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.450
 hole and gladly absorb 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:19.579
 water proof that they are very 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:24.690
 like everything take bangs and other 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:29.459
 plant on look here for example ice 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:33.030
 Volga is a very desirable variety for a long time. 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.919
 I wanted to build it was very weak 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.470
 very hilary zone which grew poorly 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:43.220
 grew very poorly but now she does 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:46.590
 already looks gorgeous and the whole buds and 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.859
 excellent side shoots that climb 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.150
 also bloom it can also be seen that 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:57.450
 the roots in climbed as I cook 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:03.989
 mats for use i mean i 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:09.810
 I cut them like this 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:12.240
 remove the tape fix tape to 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.650
 she doesn't 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.410
 did not go astray and it all fits 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.910
 there are such a size 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.620
 trays for seedlings 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.290
 they are not deep and very comfortable not so 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.050
 what is more is less is less 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:36.860
 By the way it is more convenient to drag them. 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.890
 here and accordingly put 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.530
 pots there pours out about 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.710
 depending on how the weather is like 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:53.250
 quickly go to dry up well and of course 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.110
 how quickly the plant develops that is 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.750
 sometimes less water is required at first 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:04.790
 I water even every day on these mats 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:07.350
 meaning what's just taking a watering can 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.140
 liter two-liter depending on 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.630
 size and pour it on this mat just 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.030
 I pour it on the mat if the plant is dry 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.010
 the top can also sprinkle it is possible 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.530
 both top watering and bottom 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.970
 fertilizer I water on the top polya 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.430
 some water on the bottom I'll go 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.030
 beyond these menus stand me on the east 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.900
 loggias 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.200
 no shading now end of june wanted 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.440
 hang tulle but changed her mind like them 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.820
 show not hot summer not to say that 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:44.190
 very hot and very sunny 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.600
 so as if here are a collection of these 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.930
 factors this is a good coverage of you 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.660
 accurate and timely watering outfit here 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.690
 such results that is such here in 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.910
 bushes mostly mostly yes 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.030
 here everywhere by analysis and planted that is 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.980
 This is what I have left for the color of the neck 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.010
 newcomers who 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:11.850
 young later planted and this is everywhere 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.870
 one mode as a rule 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.740
 may ling him here are the plants here too 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.600
 one arizona 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.470
 pot about liter 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:27.750
 favor me 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.330
 for such here, for example, show it to us 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.750
 nocturne 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:41.820
 he is such a huge here by 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:44.700
 my 2 and ash and soot so try 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.400
 capillary mats especially who do not 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.390
 manages a valium who has a large collection 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.490
 but also just for good development 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:58.070
 plants can use excellent 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.070
 I highly recommend this thing to everyone so far.
