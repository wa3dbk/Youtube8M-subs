00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
unlimited bandwidth connection if your

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.199 
unlimited bandwidth connection if your
speed<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.690> good<00:02:43.079> enough<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.060> should

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
speed is good enough then you should

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.900 
speed is good enough then you should
turn<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.480> down<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.930> am<00:02:46.920> turning<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.310> on<00:02:47.430> because

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
turn it down I am turning it on because

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
turn it down I am turning it on because
I<00:02:48.180> think<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.320> good<00:02:49.769> D<00:02:50.900> if<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.049> turn<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.350> on

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
I think it's a good D if I turn it on

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.080 
I think it's a good D if I turn it on
then<00:02:52.739> most<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.100> people<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.489> get<00:02:53.730> updates

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
then most of people can get updates

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.960 
then most of people can get updates
quickly<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:55.320> equality<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.579> downloading

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
quickly on equality of the downloading

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.479 
quickly on equality of the downloading
speed<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.570> people's<00:02:57.959> will<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.320> good<00:02:58.769> so

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
speed for other people's will be good so

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.270 
speed for other people's will be good so
that's<00:02:59.850> my<00:03:00.150> choice<00:03:01.019> my<00:03:01.230> option<00:03:01.620> that's<00:03:02.040> what<00:03:02.250> I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
that's my choice my option that's what I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.490 
that's my choice my option that's what I
like<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.420> want<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.900> simply<00:03:04.320> turn

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
like but if you want to can simply turn

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.979 
like but if you want to can simply turn
it<00:03:04.620> off<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.519> will<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:06.180> affect<00:03:06.360> your<00:03:06.600> PC
