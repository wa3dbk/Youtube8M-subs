00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.900
 for me the clothes the wardrobe the shoes 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.890
 accessories are like small pieces 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.290
 pieces of art for me then always 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.010
 I go for example to the rose that is where 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.050
 where greater in greater place I play 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.960
 buy find things that I like 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.300
 because they are unique things I think that my 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.420
 style has to do with a little bit of that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.940
 a little vintage I've always been with a 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.100
 little bit of punk I like the style 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.210
 medium so that it is not like 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.899
 conventional what you what 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.899
 conventional 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.290
 as I am vegan 'clearly influence 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.330
 my wardrobe clothes decisions 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.640
 absolutely now that there is summer like 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.940
 me that sometimes if we buy for example 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.120
 leather shoes that are are liked or 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.130
 there are stores that occupy recycled leather 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.400
 for some things I the truth that 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.800
 I kept taking it from me from my closet now 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.280
 clearly my work has to be a 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.119
 little bit talibana because I do not know there's 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 gala events and I have to go impeccable and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.780
 there are times that I can not find a 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.210
 shoe for example melissa that I 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 they love that they combine with color 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.500
 the costumes with the dress 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.689
 there are Chilean designers that I 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:41.289
 like and if you always resort to 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.850
 them to acquire garment go or when 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.750
 I need help to dress me up 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.600
 Antonio, I do not think what Antonio has 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.969
 that I like a lot is his in his subject with 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.299
 the fabric the system with the design of the 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.799
 clothes that he appeals a lot as used and 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.890
 I find it very interesting what 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.740
 ago and the lupe gajardo that is another of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.739
 my favorite that works a lot with linen 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.560
 with noble material and also has 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:10.239
 shapes and cuts who calls me a lot the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.230

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.650
 of clothes that like ethnic media things like 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.629
 wide than in the background as the non-typical 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.450
 it's like everything always as close to 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.340
 body showing the figure I like that 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.060
 Zorita work from the other place and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.440
 she is also very feminine 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.470
 in portugal in front of the animal there is a 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.480
 with the clothes but spectacular and tino and 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.450
