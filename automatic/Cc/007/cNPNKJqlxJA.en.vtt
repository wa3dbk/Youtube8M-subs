00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
the thing is powered on that's not a

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:41.929 
the thing is powered on that's not a
very<00:03:36.689> good<00:03:36.810> idea<00:03:37.079> but<00:03:40.069> now<00:03:41.069> it's<00:03:41.280> firmly<00:03:41.609> fits

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
very good idea but now it's firmly fits
