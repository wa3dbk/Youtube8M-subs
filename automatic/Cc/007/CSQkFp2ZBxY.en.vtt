00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.110
 We are going to prepare velvet sponge cake 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.420
 red the ingredients that we need 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.320
 They are for a mold of 23 centimeters 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.960
 diameter 250 grams of flour 250 grams 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.900
 of sugar 2 eggs 200 milliliters of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.720

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.800
 a teaspoon of vanilla essence 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.500
 three tablespoons of milk 14 grams of 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.710
 yeast royal or baking powder a 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.530
 Natural yogurt and red coloring better if 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.380
 it's in gel or powder cream and we start 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.170
 Sifting the dry ingredients as 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.170
 sugar is the flour 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.810
 salt the cocoa powder and the yeast or 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.330
 baking powder 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.200
 and with the help of a colander we are going to 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.690
 leave everything well past and without lumps and what 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.300
 we reserve we go to our blender 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.300
 of rods and let's beat the eggs 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 until it is pu men 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280
 once they are catching 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 we are going to add oil to them 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.070
 slowly 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.960
 when we have added the oil 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.900
 we put a little essence of 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.540
 vanilla 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.690
 and we will also add yogurt 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690
 natural 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.280
 we also put the teaspoon of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.430
 vinegar of which you always ask me 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.460
 that what is its function we add the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.150
 red coloring and I tell you that the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.130
 vinegar in this case for biscuits 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.960
 it works as a kind of preservative 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.540
 of moisture and makes the cake 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.810
 is much more juicy and therefore 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.479
 richer one time it has mixed well 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.429
 color we are going to add flour 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.700
 Sifted with the rest of the ingredients 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.190
 little by little and spoonful scoop for 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 that is integrated slowly and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.660
 finally we are going to add three 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.239
 spoonfuls of milk so that we do not get 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.239
 is a mixture so thick is 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.620
 as far as milk has been incorporated 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.220
 well to the dough and it has a texture 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.770
 soft 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.770
 let's in butter our mold 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.710
 we are going to take a teaspoon of 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.730
 flour 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.920
 and we are going to encamisar it so that later 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.340
 unmolds everything well although it is a mold of 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.569
 Silicone is never over this step 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.969
 add the cake dough 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.980
 and the oven we have to have hot 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.530
 at 180 degrees 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.810
 and we are going to give him a few taps to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.190
 that air bubbles rise 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.900
 too big 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.930
 you see how they rise and explode 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.120
 and we put it in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.120
 about 40 or 45 minutes we did not have 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 Four. Five 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.970
 to check that the best is done 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.680
 is to puncture it in the center with the help 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:38.780
 from a pinchito you see and if it comes out clean it's 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.780
 that we have our perfect cake 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.319
 we take them out of the oven 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.239
 and let it cool to unmold it and 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.940
 Fill it with the toilet cream 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.920
 authentic butter of the velvet net or 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.770
 with the filling that we like the most 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.020
 our ganache chocolate case 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.910
 marzipan and cheese frosting that you can 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.400
 see in our special pie 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.400
 Christmas that is delicious
