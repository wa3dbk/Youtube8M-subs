can do what was the philosophy behind

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
can do what was the philosophy behind
just<00:02:20.700> doing<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> third<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.480> fourth<00:02:21.750> courses

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
just doing the third and fourth courses

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.110 
just doing the third and fourth courses
doubled<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.709> opposed<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.220> maybe<00:02:23.610> doing<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.910> ten

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
doubled as opposed to maybe doing a ten

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.390 
doubled as opposed to maybe doing a ten
string<00:02:24.450> well<00:02:24.959> when<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.260> did<00:02:25.440> more<00:02:25.800> strings

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
string well when we did more strings

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.790 
string well when we did more strings
it<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.630> started<00:02:27.930> sounding<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> twelve

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
it just started sounding like a twelve

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.010 
it just started sounding like a twelve
string<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.880> was<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.209> way<00:02:30.630> too

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
string you know it was just way too

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.050 
string you know it was just way too
jangly<00:02:31.620> twelve<00:02:32.220> string<00:02:32.489> E<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.850> wasn't

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
jangly twelve string E and that wasn't

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
jangly twelve string E and that wasn't
the<00:02:33.300> fact<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.750> still<00:02:33.780> wanted<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.800> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the fact we still wanted this kind of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
the fact we still wanted this kind of
you<00:02:35.730> know<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.420> sort<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.720> six<00:02:36.989> string

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
you know this this sort of six string

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
you know this this sort of six string

vibe and so those just added that you
can<00:02:42.150> also<00:02:42.300> play<00:02:42.660> down<00:02:42.870> here

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.350 

so<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.560> playing<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.920> baritone<00:02:50.360> it's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
so here I'm playing a baritone it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.260 
so here I'm playing a baritone it's
tuned<00:02:51.720> way<00:02:52.020> down<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:53.310> by<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.580> playing<00:02:53.970> these

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
tuned way down but by just playing these

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.500 
tuned way down but by just playing these
strings<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.350> stay<00:02:55.740> off<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> end<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:57.090> sounds

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
strings I can stay off the end it sounds

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.950 
strings I can stay off the end it sounds
like<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> normal<00:02:58.080> guitar<00:02:59.480> but<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.630> doesn't

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
like a normal guitar but that doesn't

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.360 
like a normal guitar but that doesn't
sound<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.350> normal<00:03:01.740> guitar<00:03:01.860> sounds<00:03:02.340> like

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
sound like a normal guitar sounds like

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.200 
sound like a normal guitar sounds like
the<00:03:02.580> bass<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.970> coming

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210

we made a nine string out of this at
first<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.160> was<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.490> big<00:03:23.670> idea<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.180> it

didn't work and so we took those you
know<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:27.090> took<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.420> string<00:03:27.690> off<00:03:27.930> there<00:03:28.230> was

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
know we took the string off there was
one<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> B<00:03:28.920> string<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.520> was<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.910> too

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120

guitar<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:52.140> know<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.500> that's<00:03:52.620> kind<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.160> what

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
guitar you know and that's kind of what

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.850 
guitar you know and that's kind of what
we<00:03:53.760> thought<00:03:54.030> we<00:03:54.240> were<00:03:54.390> accomplishing<00:03:55.350> by

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
we thought we were accomplishing by

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.820 
we thought we were accomplishing by
adding<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.610> takes<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.030> baritone<00:03:57.830> that

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
adding this it takes that baritone that

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.320
