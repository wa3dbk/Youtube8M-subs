 Saved by users of SPAMES are 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.530
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.660
 video dedicated to fifa last 15 teams a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.390
 video in which we will talk about the five 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.849
 players I hate most about rooftops but 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.920
 obviously it is a hatred not in reality 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.740
 so they are players rather than many 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.420
 I really appreciate some of them 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.310
 even rooting for them I follow them a lot 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.160
 very willingly but they are players 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.170
 that when the meeting on the latest teams 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.570
 often against however because some 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.070
 they are also quite expensive suffers 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.199
 a lot so it could also be i 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.780
 players that I suffer most recently 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.970
 team I did not want to put the various crops 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.339
 and ronaldo because in any case despite being 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.589
 I don't particularly suffer from them 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.030
 because from those players you can 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.470
 wait maybe even a goal I put it 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.210
 in budget but this its own players 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.339
 what I hate to face 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.269
 let's start immediately with a player who 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.180
 you all know 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.040
 aguero version 86 then the version 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.989
 base not that upgrade and it's the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.059
 player who oil more among the premier 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.670
 league between attackers because why 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.039
 is an attacker with the right warcraft 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.590
 high low 4 star ski 4 star foot 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:15.109
 weak very fast because the 90's 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.909
 acceleration is really high 89 of 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.039
 therefore penalty also knows 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.960
 pull because it has good power of 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.189
 we have a shot at a good finish 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.899
 seen at four stars weak foot 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.560
 so you can pull if right than from 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.310
 left 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.259
 in short, a real nightmare for my defense 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.119
 every time I face it I suffer 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.579
 a lot because anyway thanks 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.399
 agility can perhaps skip 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.499
 Defenders maybe you part 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.329
 acceleration not recovered even more 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.670
 68 of physical strength which therefore are not 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.950
 very low then less bad than before 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.509
 so it was a fairly high price 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.579
 you didn't always see him now that he is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.630
 coming down to 80 thousand creditis 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.060
 xbox 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.569
 I meet him often and really trust him 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.149
 a nightmare to face it we remain in 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.130
 premier league and let's move on 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.100
 from the attack to the door then we do 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 a complete change and let's talk about thibaut 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.500
 courtois chelsea goalkeeper 86 of 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.600
 rating a 99 meter high 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.180
 therefore very high as a goal keeper 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.610
 overtime is one of the goalkeepers case of 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.340
 more in the game because when he faces it 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.300
 become 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.450
 really really hard to pass this 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.730
 player because practically everything 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.680
 para all this is absurd 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.590
 pests shoots from afar that those from 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 near good he is on the cross it was not even 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.379
 very badly on the exits so really 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.450
 paradoxically absurd is the best 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.650
 goalkeeper of the game while not having the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.450
 highest rating because in my opinion 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.980
 we were easier to deal with too 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.400
 us at the team of the year that I tried 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.349
 at times against me it has not me several times 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.620
 never given the impression of a goalkeeper 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.690
 that is worth the money courtois instead of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.519
 home with 20 thousand credits on playstation e 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.200
 trust is a wall 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.610
 more generally however in the category of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.440
 porters we could put any 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.030
 goalkeeper who to the opponent because there 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.950
 are those games where you find yourself 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.079
 goalkeeper fortissimo then say 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.970
 hell I want to try it, take it 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.900
 you and this one sucks this unfortunately 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.959
 it happens very often we change championship 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.030
 and we go to bundesliga with jerome 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.040
 boateng to its upgrade version 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.290
 the strongest central defender of the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.840
 I play in my opinion because you know 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.609
 the central defenders usually or are 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.290
 slow but have so much physical strength maybe 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.609
 they are fast but not much less than 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.670
 physical strength such as thiago 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.370
 silva boateng has no problems because it is 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.739
 fast because of ok 70 of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.989
 acceleration then in the short you could 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.389
 also surpass it but in the long in the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.940
 long at 87 and repeat 87 of speed 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.269
 maximum with 88 of physical strength then 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.250
 exposed anyone who retrieves anyone 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.900
 because even if you have ronaldo e 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.459
 maybe you have a few meters of advantage 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.680
 not even a meter is enough 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.970
 boateng advantage trust me veil recovers 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.370
 because he did n't go with the ball anyway 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.560
 runs slower boateng quietly 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.560
 he takes it back and steals the ball he has 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.540
 also excellent values to a perfect work is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.989
 one meter high and 92 and then take it from 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.630
 head 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.780
 I really don't have an absurd player 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.450
 idea how version 88 could be 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.599
 which is the formica version it came out 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.000
 with 93 of physical strength but trust for i 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.270
 20,000 credits which costs version 86 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.660
 it was worth it he and he is enough 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.730
 you want to have a defender 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.090
 trustworthy put them boateng and maybe 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.160
 stand alongside a right-back 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.170
 silver I hate with all of which 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.580
 probably the most player 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.670
 annoying that I face 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.560
 it is dennis diekmeier sino 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.800
 right of the ambiguus 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.680
 therefore always speed bundesliga 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.720
 so very fast he has an excellent physique 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.120
 do not trust what paper said that 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.920
 marks only 72 of physical with 70 of strength 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.080
 physics this man is a monster 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.060
 so everyone moves me 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.430
 maybe I put a neymar on the band 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.280
 this keeps it moving at its speed 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.620
 physically really an absurd player 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.690
 even at one meter and 88 then head 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.890
 takes them because you know maybe one goes to 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.510
 send a cross 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.160
 the ball arrives long where it is 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.840
 the full-back I often maybe put 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.060
 flying mobs are that it is not 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.190
 particularly high so there comes a 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.500
 striker who went to the second post 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.020
 in a bit taller type ibra and marks 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.120
 easily than mair it is one meter high and 88 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.100
 and also knows how to jump so you can't 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.320
 make it of mayer not of the players who 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.920
 I hate the most about this because fifa 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.290
 practically for me for how I play 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.390
 insurmountable we close with false 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.660
 player because he is not a player I am 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.210
 three players and it's the trident that I hate 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.360
 more in liga bbva in general the 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.740
 trident of players that I suffer the most 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.320
 you know that there are many in the liga bbva 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.980
 strong players and the neymar trident 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.200
 suarez bale always makes me suffer because 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.960
 it's a complete trident they are all very much 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.000
 fast bale is a force of nature 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.660
 when it leaves practically does not stop it 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.610
 never suarez perfect finalizer of 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.320
 give the ball and score all have between one 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.700
 great dribbling neymar is fast a 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.300
 five stars this punishes the pains 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.080
 weak so really a trident that ok 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.970
 you probably have to spend to do it 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.480
 about 800 thousand credits but trust us there 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.540
 so many people who have 800 thousand credits e 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.520
 you do this trident and you really suffer 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.350
 so paradoxically when he met 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.830
 teams with this trident then with 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.290
 bain suarez neymar point to make more goals 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.450
 because liga bbva defenses often do n't 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.129
 they are exceptional many maybe put 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.929
 more than they exaggerate sky in my opinion 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.669
 do not combine well or maybe put together 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.679
 also dani alves with piqué near and 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.149
 therefore they leave absurd holes therefore 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:48.459
 paradoxically when he met this 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:49.809
 of the laughing I already think to do her at least 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:52.629
 three four goals because surely 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.159
 I will suffer a lot of themes which are i 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.259
 your players you suffer the most 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.739
 suffered 15 last teams we will see each other 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.550
 soon 

00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:59.550
 Hi everyone
