00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.980
 Pictures like these can often be found in the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.250
 net started with a relatively new one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.410
 camera genus of action cam the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 small wonders are between 70 and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.180
 230 grams heavy and can be with the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.250
 appropriate accessories almost everywhere 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.390
 fix 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.789
 Meanwhile, there is action camcorder 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.029
 from a variety of suppliers both 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.990
 well-known as well as lesser-known 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.880
 but you should not 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.529
 promise that this action 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 congo or the same video and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.180
 achieve sound quality like the larger ones 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.309
 camcorder the comparison with a video 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 suitable SLR camera makes it 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.379
 clear 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.059
 especially with bad ones 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.670
 lighting conditions is the picture quality 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.950
 the action camps much lower 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 Distort the wide-angle lenses frequently 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.739
 very strong just barely every second action 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 cam has image stabilization 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.460
 this works in the difference to many 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.590
 camcorders only electronic action 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 camcorders are suitable for that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.329
 They are out in the wind and weather 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.970
 play and sport uses to stop 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 action video footage for what 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.080
 they are less suitable 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 high quality video recordings and above all 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.549
 not suitable for audio recordings 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.400
 many action camps do not offer one 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.320
 possibility to preview on videos who 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 the picture wants to control 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.030
 formula out tiny memory card and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.740
 read out a smartphone or pc 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.320
 who the actions are sick or are very 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.909
 small and have rather little possibilities 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.780
 targeted specific settings 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.240
 make 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.890
 some have a monitor where to do that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.619
 Most people can see the motive 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.610
 not at all and then you have to 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 Build wireless connections via 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.299
 wlan and set up this 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.220
 Connection is also relatively expensive 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.420
 that overall, handling something 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.020
 is complicated 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 but for that the action games make it possible 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.759
 spectacular perspectives and partly 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.799
 even slow motion shots who a little bit 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.790
 patience and the joy of experimentation brings 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.159
 will certainly have fun with it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.049
 all test results for 14 action games 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.200
 is there in the november edition of test 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.160
 or on the internet at www test de
