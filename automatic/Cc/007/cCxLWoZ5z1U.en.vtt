00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.150
 the well-being elegance and softness are 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.000
 Air characteristics that the project 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.460
 Let's meet today and sign the project. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.190
 interior designers lucila 7 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.470
 ângela marques girls okay okay 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.879
 And you see, Camila, that you 're okay too. 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.160
 It's a lot of Brazil and here in the program that 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.230
 Are you trying not to try not to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.510
 They already do the best, alright, you're a 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.579
 welcome, he saw his mother is here with 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.230
 You again because of our whole reason. 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.940
 from here you have them 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.920
 Angela tells us how it went 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.610
 concept to this project 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.190
 was challenged by the profile of the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.920
 customer that the customer a person who 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.699
 has a very strong personality then 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.930
 You have to suit your 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.950
 professional capacity with the profile of 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.080
 person 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.520
 I think this relationship between the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.860
 professional and customer the professional 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.950
 even if it is almost a psychologist or not 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.900
 sometimes and this client's case 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.540
 specifically in this project how 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.909
 was not too difficult because 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.580
 first she was already a friend and was 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.310
 very gratifying for us because we 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.140
 end of the project she said that it is 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.490
 exactly what she wanted then 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.560
 This is the best payment for any 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.270
 Professional, I know if I want to ask you. 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.030
 customer reaction at the end that is the dream 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.829
 is followed by the dreams of exactly her 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.950
 You're very happy about it all because 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.340
 she got to know enough artists 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.380
 is that the areas and turim she liked very much 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.820
 of everything we've done for him 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.340
 oh how nice this is the most important 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.250
 the end result on top of all this 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.409
 process this dating that flirts with 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 meetings the client stays 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.250
 pleased 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.520
 Thank you, you saw several elements in this. 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 design and focus serenity which you 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.950
 highlights the first one in 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.099
 doubt is nature itself because it is 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.580
 a load waiting for the hot one and has a 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.160
 part of the stroke that this nature enters 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.980
 In the house you know that mine and she wanted everything 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.739
 very light very beige knows something 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.519
 We see the hot and put a lot of 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.040
 stone in the house the floor is all white né 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.310
 the crystals that are wonderful we 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.319
 We used a light from the dikes to the fantastic 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.019
 very cool I said the customer likes 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.940
 light tones and light colors but I know 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.459
 There's a lot going on in the house too. 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.130
 Do you know that color work in the house? 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.769
 color placement was specifically 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.200
 works already we put tables 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.709
 for example those are colored 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.959
 very colorful, so it was what gave 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.400
 an up in the house né that made 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.310
 enter the color movement is through the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.349
 color and this green guinea all comes from 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.420
 outdoor area can house and also the 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.660
 expenses and ambiance of the external 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.130
 this atmosphere did take the environments 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.829
 internal right 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.010
 so I thought it was legal for the customer 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.590
 I liked super just have certainly looks 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.590
 so we did well the style she 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.350
 asked us one of the spaces are bigger the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.670
 is making it easier or more difficult 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.060
 decoration time 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.280
 sometimes it is not always easier 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.000
 one year when a single environment 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 you integrate the furniture and it 's a pity the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.450
 environment it is formed and it is ready 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.400
 now condition several environments one 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.440
 single space 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.459
 You have to make them talk right. 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.139
 besides staying environment and individual 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.600
 they have become a single environment 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.680
 No one has to talk to each other. 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.359
 so sometimes it's easy because you can 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.000
 specify any size of 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.780
 furniture that fits in the house is sometimes 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.549
 Do you want to make a three-meter sofa? 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.500
 as we have used a lot today in 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.800
 day 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.140
 follows quietly put it right then 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.459
 Does this side of good 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.870
 already the spaces are integrated 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.690
 distribution of parts 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.810
 to respect a whole circulation who 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.800
 functional neither newspaper nor even functional 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.840
 because the house in the house here is very 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.960
 nice then understood in any 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.790
 place where you are you feel very 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.600
 well because the house brings a certain peace to 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.810
 house was well balanced well 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.030
 planned to suit her and gave 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.000
 the combination of our taste with taste 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.610
 She understood then, even though it was the house 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.610
 Had her profile also has much 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.710
 thing that we did and that are also 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.720
 things that we like very much and I 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.760
 mainly works of art 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.280
 the end result of this project, people 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.050
