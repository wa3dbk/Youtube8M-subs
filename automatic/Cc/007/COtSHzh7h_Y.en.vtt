over<00:01:43.569> 3<00:01:43.749> to<00:01:43.810> 4<00:01:43.959> weeks<00:01:44.169> and<00:01:44.319> see<00:01:44.499> how<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.649> feel

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:44.919 
over 3 to 4 weeks and see how you feel

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:46.709 
over 3 to 4 weeks and see how you feel
and<00:01:45.819> then<00:01:45.939> hopefully<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.239> can<00:01:46.329> get<00:01:46.419> away<00:01:46.509> with

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
and then hopefully you can get away with

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.449 
and then hopefully you can get away with
taking<00:01:46.959> less<00:01:47.109> of<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.349> but<00:01:47.499> usually<00:01:47.739> your<00:01:48.249> body

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
taking less of it but usually your body

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.459 
taking less of it but usually your body
is<00:01:48.579> so<00:01:48.729> depleted<00:01:48.969> from<00:01:49.270> hard<00:01:49.539> training<00:01:49.810> from

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
is so depleted from hard training from

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.059 
is so depleted from hard training from
stress<00:01:51.029> that<00:01:52.029> you<00:01:52.630> need<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> short<00:01:53.529> period<00:01:53.829> to

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
stress that you need a short period to

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.440 
stress that you need a short period to
really<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.700> dosage<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.209> lot<00:01:55.359> of

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
really up the dosage in a lot of

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.769 
really up the dosage in a lot of
saturation<00:01:56.319> of<00:01:56.499> your<00:01:56.590> system<00:01:57.569> another<00:01:58.569> thing

00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:58.779 
saturation of your system another thing

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:00.599 
saturation of your system another thing
you<00:01:58.840> may<00:01:58.959> want<00:01:58.989> to<00:01:59.139> try<00:01:59.289> Jake<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.739> inositol<00:02:00.009> so

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
you may want to try Jake is inositol so

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.679 
you may want to try Jake is inositol so
inositol<00:02:00.969> is<00:02:01.209> something<00:02:01.450> that's<00:02:01.569> been

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
inositol is something that's been

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.999 
inositol is something that's been
suggested<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.349> balance<00:02:02.829> your

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
suggested to balance your

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.010 
suggested to balance your
neurotransmitters<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.819> your<00:02:03.849> brain<00:02:03.939> so<00:02:04.809> a<00:02:04.840> lot

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
neurotransmitters in your brain so a lot

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.999 
neurotransmitters in your brain so a lot
of<00:02:05.109> people<00:02:05.319> have<00:02:05.469> an<00:02:05.619> overstate

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
of people have an overstate

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.119 
of people have an overstate
overproduction<00:02:06.669> of<00:02:07.560> acetylcholine<00:02:08.560> over

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
overproduction of acetylcholine over

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.889 
overproduction of acetylcholine over
production<00:02:09.549> of<00:02:09.700> dopamine<00:02:10.149> or<00:02:10.420> maybe<00:02:10.689> an<00:02:10.750> under

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
production of dopamine or maybe an under

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.569 
production of dopamine or maybe an under
production<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.650> dopamine<00:02:12.069> over<00:02:12.370> production

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
production of dopamine over production

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.429 
production of dopamine over production
it's<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.269> imbalances

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
it's just imbalances

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.780 
it's just imbalances
so<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.769> know<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.010> lot<00:02:15.129> of<00:02:15.249> people<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.519> can't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so I know a lot of people that can't

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.410 
so I know a lot of people that can't
sleep<00:02:15.909> are<00:02:16.180> usually<00:02:16.499> pretty<00:02:17.939> fast<00:02:18.939> thinking

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
sleep are usually pretty fast thinking

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.270 
sleep are usually pretty fast thinking
people<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.230> usually<00:02:20.349> say<00:02:20.590> smarter<00:02:21.040> people

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
people so I usually say smarter people

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.949 
people so I usually say smarter people
have<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> hard<00:02:21.609> time<00:02:21.760> thinking<00:02:21.969> I<00:02:22.329> just<00:02:22.659> because

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
have a hard time thinking I just because

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.449 
have a hard time thinking I just because
you<00:02:23.019> have<00:02:23.109> so<00:02:23.290> much<00:02:23.409> acetylcholine<00:02:23.980> charlize

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
you have so much acetylcholine charlize

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.009 
you have so much acetylcholine charlize
driven<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:24.879> type-a<00:02:25.180> personality<00:02:25.780> people

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
driven like type-a personality people

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.470 
driven like type-a personality people
are<00:02:26.109> always<00:02:26.349> like<00:02:26.650> go-go-go<00:02:27.189> so<00:02:27.909> much<00:02:28.060> little

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
are always like go-go-go so much little

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.729 
are always like go-go-go so much little
choline<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:28.930> their<00:02:29.049> brain<00:02:29.260> which<00:02:29.499> is<00:02:29.590> like

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
choline in their brain which is like

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.940 
choline in their brain which is like
their<00:02:29.859> drive<00:02:30.579> home<00:02:30.849> no<00:02:31.480> transmitter<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.620> it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
their drive home no transmitter so it

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.319 
their drive home no transmitter so it
really<00:02:33.099> has<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.579> hard<00:02:33.790> time<00:02:33.819> they<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> hard

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
really has a hard time they have a hard

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.490 
really has a hard time they have a hard

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
time sleeping so taking something like

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.709 
time sleeping so taking something like
inositol<00:02:35.829> before<00:02:36.489> bed<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:37.269> about<00:02:37.420> three<00:02:37.629> to

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
inositol before bed just about three to

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.289 
inositol before bed just about three to
five<00:02:37.840> grams<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:39.280> good<00:02:39.549> amount<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.120> can

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
five grams is a good amount and can

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.809

have amazing sleep then there's gaba so
if<00:02:56.019> i've<00:02:56.169> HCP<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.859> precursor<00:02:57.159> to<00:02:57.340> gaba

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
if i've HCP is just a precursor to gaba

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.039 
if i've HCP is just a precursor to gaba
but<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.299> can<00:02:58.449> actually<00:02:58.540> take<00:02:58.689> a<00:02:58.810> dab<00:02:59.019> of

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
but you can actually take a dab of

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.649 
but you can actually take a dab of
supplement<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.650> well<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.519> get<00:03:01.090> amazing<00:03:01.389> sleep

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
supplement as well I get amazing sleep

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.119 
supplement as well I get amazing sleep
off<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.079> actually<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.709> take<00:03:02.919> if<00:03:03.040> you

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
off of that I actually you take if you

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.939 
off of that I actually you take if you
take<00:03:03.189> too<00:03:03.459> much<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.639> it<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:04.060> don't<00:03:04.510> say<00:03:04.689> that<00:03:04.949> if

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:05.949 
take too much of it I don't say that if

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.129 
take too much of it I don't say that if

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
you take this suggested doses about 1500

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.379 
you take this suggested doses about 1500
milligrams<00:03:08.469> you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.459> take<00:03:09.609> up<00:03:09.699> to<00:03:09.760> 3<00:03:09.969> grams<00:03:10.209> at

milligrams you can take up to 3 grams at
a<00:03:10.449> time<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:12.090> typically<00:03:13.090> if<00:03:13.209> you've<00:03:13.329> never
