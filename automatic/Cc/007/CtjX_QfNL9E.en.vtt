00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
set rule but here's why I'm using this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.310 
set rule but here's why I'm using this
three<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:20.699> using<00:00:20.880> today<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.109> saw

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
three that I'm using today you just saw

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.570 
three that I'm using today you just saw
me<00:00:22.470> grading<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.070> cheddar

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
me grading up some cheddar

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
me grading up some cheddar

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that's because cheddar has a universally

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.679 
that's because cheddar has a universally
liked<00:00:25.710> flavor<00:00:26.189> then<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:26.849> also<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.300> some

the first step in making a béchamel or a
white<00:00:56.280> sauce<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.850> making<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> roux<00:00:58.050> ro<00:00:58.530> u<00:00:58.829> X<00:00:59.340> Roux

white sauce is making a roux ro u X Roux

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
white sauce is making a roux ro u X Roux
it's<00:01:00.539> simply<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> mixture<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> butter<00:01:01.770> and

it's simply a mixture of butter and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's simply a mixture of butter and
flour<00:01:02.039> cooked<00:01:02.699> together<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.110> because

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
flour cooked together we do that because

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289 
flour cooked together we do that because
if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.890> cook<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> flour<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
if you cook the flour a little bit in

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.789 
if you cook the flour a little bit in
the<00:01:06.420> butter<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.780> doesn't<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.229> sort<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the butter it doesn't have sort of a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.270 
the butter it doesn't have sort of a
dusty<00:01:08.790> harsh<00:01:09.060> taste<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> end<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> once

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
dusty harsh taste at the end so once

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
dusty harsh taste at the end so once
your<00:01:11.430> butter<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> melted<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.450> ahead<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.930> add

like<00:01:19.920> wet<00:01:20.250> sand<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> pan<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> we're<00:01:22.530> gonna

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like wet sand in the pan and we're gonna

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.289 
like wet sand in the pan and we're gonna
cook<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.369> minutes<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:24.150> to
