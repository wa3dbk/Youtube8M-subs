yawning<00:00:29.220> did<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> yawning<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
yawning did you know that yawning is

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.959 
yawning did you know that yawning is
actually<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> first<00:00:31.769> expression<00:00:32.309> dogs

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
actually the first expression dogs

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.610 
actually the first expression dogs
learned<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> use<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:33.809> they're<00:00:33.930> tiny<00:00:34.170> puppies

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so it has multiple meanings depending on

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.950 
so it has multiple meanings depending on
the<00:00:37.170> situation<00:00:37.710> they're<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.520> ecstatic<00:00:39.510> joy

the situation they're in so ecstatic joy

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.690 
the situation they're in so ecstatic joy
could<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:40.980> emotions<00:00:41.460> right

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
could be one of these emotions right

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.779 
could be one of these emotions right

might be asking you to give him a little
break<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:08.880> sees<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
break that is if he sees you as the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.920 
break that is if he sees you as the
dominant<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.470> your<00:01:10.619> relationship<00:01:11.310> um

let's<00:01:12.930> move<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> next<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> could

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
let's move on to the next thing it could

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.249 
let's move on to the next thing it could
mean<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.600> dog<00:01:15.840> might<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
mean which is that your dog might be

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.530 
mean which is that your dog might be
cooling<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.890> his<00:01:17.280> brain<00:01:17.670> there's<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
cooling off his brain there's a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
cooling off his brain there's a
veterinary<00:01:19.140> behaviorist<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.890> UC<00:01:20.189> Davis<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
veterinary behaviorist at UC Davis that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
veterinary behaviorist at UC Davis that
thinks<00:01:20.909> dog<00:01:21.330> brains<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.140> hot<00:01:22.500> during<00:01:22.890> periods

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
thinks dog brains get hot during periods

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.840 
thinks dog brains get hot during periods
of<00:01:23.400> inactivity

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
of inactivity

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.399 
of inactivity
it<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.420> gets<00:01:24.509> warm<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it just gets warm because the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
it just gets warm because the
circulation<00:01:26.220> slows<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.330> yawning

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
circulation slows down so yawning

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
circulation slows down so yawning
supposedly<00:01:28.619> cools<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.220> arterial<00:01:29.880> blood

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
supposedly cools that arterial blood

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.960 
supposedly cools that arterial blood
down<00:01:30.450> helping<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> dog's<00:01:31.770> brain<00:01:32.130> function<00:01:32.790> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
down helping the dog's brain function so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
down helping the dog's brain function so
I'm<00:01:33.270> either<00:01:33.420> dominating<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.170> dog<00:01:34.380> too<00:01:34.680> much<00:01:34.920> or

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
he's having trouble thinking because

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.569 
he's having trouble thinking because
he's<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.530> doing<00:01:37.829> anything<00:01:38.040> while<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.460> at
