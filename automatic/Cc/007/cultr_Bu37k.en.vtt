have to do is give a little I give a
little<00:01:36.479> curl<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.770> sensor<00:01:38.189> down

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
little curl there and that sensor down

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.820 
little curl there and that sensor down
in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.790> direction<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:40.110> really

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
in the right direction it's really

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.740 
in the right direction it's really
for<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.100> ladies<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.180> come<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
for the ladies when they come down to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
for the ladies when they come down to
this<00:01:42.870> end<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.220> about<00:01:44.370> doing<00:01:44.730> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
this end they just think about doing a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.700 
this end they just think about doing a
regular<00:01:45.510> actor<00:01:45.750> stack<00:01:46.230> they're<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
regular actor stack they're just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.340 
regular actor stack they're just
thinking<00:01:47.160> anchor<00:01:47.760> stuff<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.900> leader<00:01:49.110> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
thinking anchor stuff but the leader is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.460 
thinking anchor stuff but the leader is
actually<00:01:49.710> pulling<00:01:50.070> her<00:01:50.430> forward<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:52.320> word

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
actually pulling her forward on the word

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
actually pulling her forward on the word
step<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.580> mean<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.900> walk<00:01:54.900> walk<00:01:55.910> anchor<00:01:56.960> fun

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
step what I mean is walk walk anchor fun

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
step what I mean is walk walk anchor fun
starts<00:01:58.410> 5th<00:01:58.830> walk<00:01:59.210> walk<00:02:00.210> triple<00:02:00.570> step<00:02:01.700> anchors

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
starts 5th walk walk triple step anchors

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.760 
starts 5th walk walk triple step anchors
step<00:02:03.330> that's<00:02:04.170> where<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.470> would<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.590> right

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
step that's where it would be right

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.070 
step that's where it would be right
