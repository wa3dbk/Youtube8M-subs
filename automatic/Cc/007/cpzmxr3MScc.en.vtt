00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
base Oh easy maybe it was super crazy I
think<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> definition<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.890> worth<00:00:32.130> was

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
think the definition of not worth was

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.010 
think the definition of not worth was
pretty<00:00:32.550> much<00:00:32.730> those<00:00:32.940> last<00:00:33.210> few<00:00:33.480> minutes<00:00:33.630> there

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
pretty much those last few minutes there

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.990 
pretty much those last few minutes there
because<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.770> ended<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.700> much

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
because they ended up going for so much

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
because they ended up going for so much
like<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.750> was<00:00:36.899> very<00:00:36.930> uncharacteristic

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
like it was very uncharacteristic

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.080 
like it was very uncharacteristic
because<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.219> were<00:00:38.309> doing<00:00:38.460> almost<00:00:38.879> nothing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because they were doing almost nothing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.459 
because they were doing almost nothing
for<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.660> long<00:00:39.809> time<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
for very long time they it's like I'm

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.990 
for very long time they it's like I'm
just<00:00:40.649> gonna<00:00:40.800> flank<00:00:41.100> I'm<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.670> kill<00:00:41.879> be

just gonna flank I'm gonna kill be
Erickson<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.690> kill<00:00:42.899> him<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.379> turtle

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
Erickson they kill him and then turtle

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.170 
Erickson they kill him and then turtle
goes<00:00:43.770> bottom<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> strange

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
goes bottom and then they do the strange

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
goes bottom and then they do the strange
trade<00:00:45.660> where<00:00:47.329> while<00:00:48.329> turtles<00:00:48.690> bottom<00:00:48.989> I'm

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
trade where while turtles bottom I'm

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
trade where while turtles bottom I'm
trying<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.700> strange<00:00:50.760> game<00:00:51.120> right

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
trying to do very strange game right

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
trying to do very strange game right
there's<00:00:51.660> an<00:00:51.780> opportunity<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.320> actually<00:00:52.469> go

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
there's an opportunity to actually go

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.619 
there's an opportunity to actually go
around<00:00:53.190> turtle<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> push<00:00:54.180> him<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
around turtle and just push him into the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
around turtle and just push him into the
bottom<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.800> able<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> pick

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
bottom are you going to be able to pick

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
bottom are you going to be able to pick
up<00:00:56.219> turtle<00:00:56.489> afterwards<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.329> we've<00:00:57.570> been

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
up turtle afterwards right we've been

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.549 
up turtle afterwards right we've been
talking<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.410> ever

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
talking about this pretty much ever

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
talking about this pretty much ever
since<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.940> saw<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> play<00:01:00.300> once<00:01:00.660> berkson<00:01:01.109> was

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
since we saw the play once berkson was

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
since we saw the play once berkson was
killed<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.980> two<00:01:02.190> inhibitors<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.910> they

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
killed with two inhibitors down they

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
killed with two inhibitors down they
don't<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.870> many<00:01:04.199> options<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.799> turtle

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
don't have that many options like turtle

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
don't have that many options like turtle
pulling<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> sneak<00:01:05.909> attack<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pulling out that sneak attack in that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
pulling out that sneak attack in that
situation<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.380> actually<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:07.860> smart<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
situation was actually really smart and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240 
situation was actually really smart and
because<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.150> takes<00:01:09.869> away<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.770> positive

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
because it it takes away most positive

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
because it it takes away most positive
opportunities<00:01:11.490> by<00:01:11.939> enemy<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> only<00:01:12.750> thing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
opportunities by enemy the only thing

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600 
opportunities by enemy the only thing
they<00:01:13.110> may<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.380> been<00:01:13.470> able<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.490> they

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they may have been able to do is if they

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.510 
they may have been able to do is if they
do<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> match<00:01:15.299> within<00:01:15.540> oxys<00:01:15.990> losing<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
do want to match within oxys losing the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.830 
do want to match within oxys losing the
third<00:01:17.520> inhibitor<00:01:17.850> anyway<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.540> match<00:01:18.659> with

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
third inhibitor anyway is to match with

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
third inhibitor anyway is to match with
the<00:01:18.900> second<00:01:19.290> inhibitor<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.130> maybe<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the second inhibitor so then maybe you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
the second inhibitor so then maybe you
can<00:01:20.850> play<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> dead<00:01:21.630> inhibitors<00:01:22.049> game<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
can play the dead inhibitors game and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
can play the dead inhibitors game and
not<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.950> steamrolled<00:01:23.220> afterwards<00:01:23.759> but

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
not get steamrolled afterwards but

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
not get steamrolled afterwards but
trying<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> end<00:01:25.140> without<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.619> main<00:01:25.830> damage

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
trying to end without your main damage

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.120 
trying to end without your main damage
dealer<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.650> work<00:01:28.740> right

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
dealer it's not gonna work right

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
dealer it's not gonna work right
overreaching<00:01:29.610> yeah<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> tough<00:01:31.140> decision

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
overreaching yeah so a tough decision

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
overreaching yeah so a tough decision
nonetheless<00:01:32.009> though<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.759> feel<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
nonetheless though and I do feel that in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.310 
nonetheless though and I do feel that in
a<00:01:33.630> sense<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> showcases<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.320> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
a sense it showcases a bit of the the

well for them here but unfortunately

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.830 
well for them here but unfortunately
with<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.399> loss<00:02:08.640> they're<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.270> vying<00:02:09.599> for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
with that loss they're not vying for

that seventh place spot anymore yeah

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.440 
that seventh place spot anymore yeah
there<00:02:11.700> could<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.970> been<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.120> three-way<00:02:12.420> tie

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
there could have been a three-way tie

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.270 
there could have been a three-way tie
for

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.740 
for
seventh<00:02:13.700> there<00:02:14.060> was<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> possibility<00:02:14.569> for

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
seventh there was a possibility for

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.120 
seventh there was a possibility for
defend<00:02:15.110> anyone<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.560> speak<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> early

defend anyone but to speak to the early
game<00:02:16.250> point<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.640> season<00:02:17.240> worth<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.510> port<00:02:17.720> early

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
game point a season worth of port early

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.390 
game point a season worth of port early
games<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.230> they<00:02:18.290> play<00:02:18.440> against<00:02:18.740> what<00:02:19.310> has

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
games and they play against what has

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400 
games and they play against what has
turned<00:02:19.700> into<00:02:20.090> probably<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.230> most

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
turned into probably the most

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.900 
turned into probably the most
conservative<00:02:21.830> team<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.490> league<00:02:22.640> with

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
conservative team in the league with

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.340 
conservative team in the league with
team<00:02:23.120> solomid<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.630> they<00:02:23.840> actually<00:02:23.990> came<00:02:24.290> out

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
team solomid and they actually came out

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.710 
team solomid and they actually came out
with<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> lead<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:24.950> honestly<00:02:25.670> as<00:02:25.940> far<00:02:26.600> as

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
with a lead and honestly as far as

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.660 
with a lead and honestly as far as
playing<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.260> mid<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.530> late<00:02:27.590> game<00:02:27.890> enemy<00:02:28.490> is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
playing the mid and late game enemy is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.400 
playing the mid and late game enemy is
not<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.209> bottom<00:02:29.510> tier<00:02:29.690> team<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.110> sense

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
not a bottom tier team in that sense

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.050 
not a bottom tier team in that sense
they<00:02:30.530> are<00:02:30.560> definitely<00:02:30.770> mid-tier<00:02:31.520> as<00:02:31.730> far<00:02:31.970> as

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
they are definitely mid-tier as far as

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.430 
they are definitely mid-tier as far as
I'd<00:02:32.180> say<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.480> NLCS<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.050> they<00:02:33.140> kind<00:02:33.350> of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
I'd say in the NLCS and they kind of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
I'd say in the NLCS and they kind of
showed<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.160> game<00:02:34.310> nearly<00:02:34.610> pulling

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
showed it in that game nearly pulling

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.940 
showed it in that game nearly pulling
out<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.209> win<00:02:35.450> against<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.230> really<00:02:36.530> poke<00:02:36.739> heavy

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
out a win against a really poke heavy

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.640 
out a win against a really poke heavy
TSM<00:02:37.819> which<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.270> strange<00:02:38.600> thing<00:02:38.690> for<00:02:38.930> TSM

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
TSM which is a strange thing for TSM

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
TSM which is a strange thing for TSM
because<00:02:39.830> they<00:02:39.920> picked<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.310> team

right<00:03:03.260> next<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.530> each<00:03:03.590> other<00:03:03.739> where<00:03:04.220> TSM<00:03:04.550> could

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
right next to each other where TSM could

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.160 
right next to each other where TSM could
probably<00:03:04.910> just<00:03:05.150> play<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.330> normal<00:03:05.390> composition

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
probably just play a normal composition

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.050 
probably just play a normal composition
and<00:03:06.350> be<00:03:06.470> able<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> run<00:03:06.800> all<00:03:06.890> over<00:03:06.920> enemy<00:03:07.430> yeah

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
and be able to run all over enemy yeah

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.580 
and be able to run all over enemy yeah
it<00:03:08.330> was<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.750> was<00:03:08.900> strange<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.230> seems<00:03:09.470> like

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
it was it was strange it seems like

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.290 
it was it was strange it seems like
maybe<00:03:09.709> that's<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> only<00:03:10.280> way<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> SM<00:03:10.790> is

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
maybe that's the only way to SM is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.880 
maybe that's the only way to SM is
playing<00:03:11.690> right<00:03:11.810> now<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:11.989> hope<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:12.260> their<00:03:12.650> sake

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
they have something else for playing

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.550 
they have something else for playing
well<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.209> yeah<00:03:14.360> if<00:03:14.480> we<00:03:14.630> look<00:03:14.810> at<00:03:14.959> playoffs<00:03:15.350> I'm

someone who can build a locket but in

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.860 
someone who can build a locket but in
this<00:03:45.470> situation<00:03:46.060> they<00:03:47.060> didn't<00:03:47.329> have<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.750> do

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
this situation they didn't have to do

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.479 
this situation they didn't have to do
that<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.230> they<00:03:48.320> could<00:03:48.470> put<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.769> locket<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.190> to

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.240 
that so they could put the locket on to
the<00:03:49.609> top<00:03:49.730> lane<00:03:50.320> maokai<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.560> as<00:03:51.739> long<00:03:51.980> as<00:03:52.100> he's

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
the top lane maokai and as long as he's

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.979 
the top lane maokai and as long as he's
safe<00:03:52.670> on<00:03:52.820> farm<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.239> jungler<00:03:53.540> or<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> top

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
safe on farm the jungler or the top

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.150 
safe on farm the jungler or the top
laner<00:03:54.230> if<00:03:54.350> they're<00:03:54.470> both<00:03:54.560> playing<00:03:54.769> chance<00:03:54.980> can

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
laner if they're both playing chance can

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.530 
laner if they're both playing chance can
absolutely<00:03:55.400> do<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:56.000> think<00:03:56.150> will<00:03:56.420> be

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
absolutely do that I think will be

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.699 
absolutely do that I think will be
better<00:03:56.720> if<00:03:56.870> they<00:03:56.989> even<00:03:57.170> had<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> damaged

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
better if they even had a damaged

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.680 
better if they even had a damaged
younger<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.370> supportive<00:03:58.850> bottom<00:03:59.570> liner

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
younger and a supportive bottom liner

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.270 
younger and a supportive bottom liner
like<00:03:59.870> Jonna<00:04:00.079> you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.590> totally<00:04:00.920> do<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.040> if

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
like Jonna you can totally do that if

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.380 
like Jonna you can totally do that if
you're<00:04:01.400> playing<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.609> group<00:04:01.790> up<00:04:01.910> game<00:04:02.060> so
