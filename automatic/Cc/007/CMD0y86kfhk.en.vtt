00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:11.550
 This item is made possible by 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:13.290
 deltion college and aj qmedia but left 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 a whole week went to Rotterdam 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.339
 wait for the next Sunday 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.749
 match against ajax and match that 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.980
 can be seen as a general 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.409
 rehearsal 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 no not a general rehearsal at all 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.929
 here we know that i have as a player 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.109
 a pec zwolle came your childhood and music 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.429
 against Ajax and there were really no others 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 things then it was not a general 

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:37.710
 rehearsal and him and the last match 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 against Ajax also played that way 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.289
 completely focus on the game against 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.219
 ajax and then you shouldn't think about it 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.660
 other matches after it is called one 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.280
 preparations you can do with fun 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.350
 I feel we found the cockpit corridor 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 that is the schedule for maikel van der werff 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.309
 things are a bit different because of yellow 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.839
 cards you got in the semi final of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.070
 the NFL cup 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.050
 miss to defend the match from 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.089
 next week he can focus there 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 also keep better at the competition 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.199
 yes sure g flower yes that I have 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.530
 I resigned now contest 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.540
 unfortunately my mine and my focus 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.329
 is of course totally the competition 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.670
 because we still have 3 games and that 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.600
 just want to close all three properly 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.299
 how do you feel about it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.450
 cup final should miss this yes yes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.040
 it's six o'clock it's really just 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 yes but i say i'm there 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
 laid down and you know I have the bee 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 I played all matches 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 and yes that you do not miss final yes that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.740
 is a pity last year I have one 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 happy to participate and yes me 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 have some years in order to to another 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.950
 to come to the final after the stay 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.479
 or bags that you that you miss these 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.579
 pec zwolle plays at least two more 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.259
 home games this season where it is the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.450
 competition ends at home against feyenoord 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 therefore plays against Ajax on Sunday 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.079
 a team that pec zwolle the latter 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.789
 year or light gives him final four 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.920
 matches no one not lost 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.359
 several times won important 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.689
 Young Cruijff cup final matches 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.159
 scale but every game is another 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.270
 in itself i think its sometimes one 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.070
 once 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.140
 want to put something right against one against 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.910
 PEC Zwolle and so on do not want 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.290
 allow but lie again 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.370
 possibilities for us but that is against 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.900
 every team 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.210
 yes then should not say it but it 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.280
 looks like it but the last one 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.710
 competitions we won and equal 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.500
 The fact is that the team played us 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.120
 and he is he does not come with one 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.590
 nice feeling towards it 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.030
 Ajax drive not so nice past 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.980
 weeks of lay in a team that the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.980
 on top of blow with I don't know 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.440
 it seems like there is one off season 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.570
 kind of like a night candle with them 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.550
 but they want to fight that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.960
 but to mount a gentleman I teach in 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.870
 they actually make such an impression that they 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.490
 ajax win against nec so what that 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.880
 both teams are about him 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.650
 just find the the spirit to order 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.580
 just with all you have such a law 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.540
 go into the cell 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.690
 what exactly do you expect from this 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.069
 contest 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.079
 well I expect a fairly open game 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.340
 ajax would like to put pressure on football 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.889
 just him just like us and yes it will be like that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.969
 and go down and hopefully take ours 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.829
 good looking 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.290
 what about injured play cm 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.540
 with to it 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.980
 that it should go pretty well today 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.359
 jordi ugly you also go inside with 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.010
 had a tap on his thigh with 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.540
 don't expect it to be a problem 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.189
 a Sunday 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.709
 expect the shell to connect the backer 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:31.840
 at the match selection 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.669
 and i hope i at least have one 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.689
 ryan thomas that can also be there 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.689
 that is frankly drawing
