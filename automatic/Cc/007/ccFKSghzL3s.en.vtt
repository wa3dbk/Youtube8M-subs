teaching shoe making here in Chicago I
got<00:00:16.120> started<00:00:16.480> shoe<00:00:16.840> making<00:00:17.050> in<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.860> 70s<00:00:18.550> since

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
got started shoe making in the 70s since

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.690 
got started shoe making in the 70s since
there<00:00:19.630> were<00:00:19.840> no<00:00:19.869> shoe<00:00:20.440> making<00:00:20.800> books<00:00:21.100> around

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
there were no shoe making books around

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.420 
there were no shoe making books around
at<00:00:22.030> the<00:00:22.150> time<00:00:22.420> that<00:00:22.900> I<00:00:22.930> could<00:00:23.230> find<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:23.920> decided

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
at the time that I could find I decided

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.970 
at the time that I could find I decided
to<00:00:24.700> deconstruct<00:00:25.600> a<00:00:25.810> pair<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.080> shoes<00:00:26.440> to<00:00:26.470> see

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
to deconstruct a pair of shoes to see

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.430 
to deconstruct a pair of shoes to see
how<00:00:27.130> they<00:00:27.340> were<00:00:27.400> made<00:00:27.700> I<00:00:28.060> had<00:00:28.750> thought<00:00:29.080> that<00:00:29.110> I

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
how they were made I had thought that I

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.100 
how they were made I had thought that I
could<00:00:29.740> get<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:29.890> pattern<00:00:30.400> from<00:00:30.730> that<00:00:31.120> I<00:00:31.540> didn't

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
could get a pattern from that I didn't

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.900 
could get a pattern from that I didn't
know<00:00:32.290> any<00:00:32.529> other<00:00:32.710> shoe<00:00:33.010> makers<00:00:33.370> at<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.579> time

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
know any other shoe makers at the time

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.040 
know any other shoe makers at the time
so<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:35.140> asked<00:00:36.129> leather<00:00:36.550> workers<00:00:37.149> what<00:00:37.570> kinds<00:00:37.989> of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
so I asked leather workers what kinds of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.029 
so I asked leather workers what kinds of
tools<00:00:38.379> I<00:00:38.649> would<00:00:38.859> need<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:40.410> gather<00:00:41.410> together<00:00:41.739> a

and for other people my dream for the
shoe<00:01:28.590> making<00:01:28.799> school<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.200> not<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.229> create

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
shoe making school is to not just create

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.010 
shoe making school is to not just create
a<00:01:32.310> whole<00:01:32.549> new<00:01:32.729> generation<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.750> cobblers

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a whole new generation of cobblers

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.529 
a whole new generation of cobblers
although<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.039> great<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
although that will be great but to

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.450 
although that will be great but to
empower<00:01:36.899> people<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.409> make<00:01:37.799> something<00:01:38.130> that's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
empower people to make something that's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
empower people to make something that's
unusual<00:01:39.360> something<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.350> wouldn't

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
unusual something that they wouldn't

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.249 
unusual something that they wouldn't
expect<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.520> ever<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.840> for

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
expect to ever get to make for

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.419 
expect to ever get to make for
themselves<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:45.709> much<00:01:46.709> of<00:01:47.159> an

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
themselves it's just that much of an

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.889 
themselves it's just that much of an
unusual<00:01:48.360> craft<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.549> love<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.539> part

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
unusual craft and so I love the part

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
where when I'm teaching a two-day class

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.830 
where when I'm teaching a two-day class
where<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.920> students<00:01:56.310> they've<00:01:57.060> cut<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.690> all

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
where the students they've cut out all

their materials they're starting to

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.190 
their materials they're starting to
assemble<00:01:59.819> them<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.209> they<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.539> this<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
assemble them and they get this look on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.010 
assemble them and they get this look on
their<00:02:01.350> face<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.720> gonna<00:02:03.899> be

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
their face like this is really gonna be

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
their face like this is really gonna be
a<00:02:04.170> shoe<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.220> making<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.299> that's
