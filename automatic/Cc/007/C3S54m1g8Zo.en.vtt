 oatmeal 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.780
 that was it already we can directly 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.059
 the preparation is given 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.100
 First you leave the vegetable stock 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.589
 together with the oil and with the salt 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 boil up and if that all then 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.390
 really nice stupid comes a tablespoon 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.430
 wheat wholegrain flour you hear that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.549
 then kill with a whisk 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.409
 and then the so is the brand of dough 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.020
 the vegetable schnitzel results and if 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.909
 the whole of the pot base take solves 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.580
 her down from the stove gives the egg and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 the yolk to it and the whole will then 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 also mixed properly if 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.560
 that is getting a bit more fluid or 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 stays then that is not so bad 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.270
 that will be compensated later and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.369
 that's just so long until it's good 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.090
 is mixed and then puts it first 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.430
 to the side 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.200
 in the meanwhile while the whole 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.299
 cools you prepare yours 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 Of course, vegetables must first 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.320
 be peeled what needs to be peeled 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 and you can really eat any vegetables here 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.710
 take what you have and if you only 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.890
 carrots then you can do the whole thing 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 even cooking with carrots yes and if 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 you have prepared the whole thing then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.530
 you cut all the vegetables in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 pretty small dice and then have to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.840
 finish with a colorful vegetable bowl 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.970
 the vegetable of your choice and it can be 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 go on in that you all the now 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.210
 the salt water bite 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 and if the whole thing is done then 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.500
 is cooked or first in the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.220
 In the meantime you can still have yours 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.200
 Chives in small rolls 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.690
 Cut about 1 tablespoon is there 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.790
 just fine and then the eggs are pouring vegetables 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.670
 and the whole thing will be a bit like that 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.140
 expressed dance while the sud on because 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.450
 We, for example, have rice 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.850
 Eaten and there you can eat the rice 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.870
 cook in the boiled water 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.090
 and then he gets a bit 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.770
 taste or vegetables will come then 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.360
 together with the herbs in a big one 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.090
 bowl and then you give that 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.770
 brandy the whole thing is going to be nice now 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.489
 Stir until everything connects well 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.350
 and for me that was relative now 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.700
 it was really fluid and still 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.519
 then you just give a handful 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.160
 oatmeal so long until the 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.140
 consistency has improved and that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.730
 whole is not so fluid because 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.180
 then you can do that on a baking paper 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.890
 be deliberate baking tray lay about one 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.470
 another one to one and a half centimeters 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.480
 high is there quite well and from yours 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.450
 Just lace as big as you like 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.310
 then the whole thing comes up at 170 degrees 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.500
 and heat in the oven for 20 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.170
 minutes and then you are as well 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.820
 pretty quickly finished then you have to 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.709
 we only have to do the whole thing 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.260
 Here with a simple sauce and rice 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.450
 made and it really has really good 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.549
 matches we found, then yes 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.920
 With that you have your vegetable schnitzel 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.860
 then already finished that is one 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.590
 great alternative if you vegetarian 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.570
 be for example and yes it tastes good 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.940
 really delicious and actually 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.030
 very easy and a lot of fun while 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.030
 to cook
