00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.110 
lost yeah no that's not what it's about
it's<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.210> think<00:04:33.660> for<00:04:34.440> me<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.830> journey<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.580> what

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
it's I think for me the journey is what

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.000 
it's I think for me the journey is what
I<00:04:36.150> enjoy<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.630> most<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:37.200> think<00:04:37.620> that's<00:04:37.830> what

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
I enjoy the most I think that's what

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.379 
I enjoy the most I think that's what
people<00:04:38.040> should<00:04:38.280> focus<00:04:38.639> all<00:04:39.030> their<00:04:39.330> attention

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
people should focus all their attention

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.970 
people should focus all their attention
and<00:04:39.810> efforts<00:04:40.050> on<00:04:40.169> is<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> journey<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:40.800> mean

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
and efforts on is the journey I mean

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.770 
and efforts on is the journey I mean
that's<00:04:41.760> what's<00:04:42.030> most<00:04:42.180> important<00:04:42.660> but

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that's what's most important but

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.420 
that's what's most important but
wouldn't<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.080> drive<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.470> destination<00:04:44.040> well<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
wouldn't it drive the destination well I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.190 
wouldn't it drive the destination well I
understand<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.120> but<00:04:45.210> but<00:04:45.840> wouldn't<00:04:46.169> it

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
understand that but but wouldn't it

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.680 
understand that but but wouldn't it
drive<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.440> crazy<00:04:46.590> if<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.280> were<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.700> know<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.480> guy

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
drive you crazy if you were I know a guy

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.390 
drive you crazy if you were I know a guy
years<00:04:49.590> ago<00:04:49.889> who<00:04:50.580> he's<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> great<00:04:51.419> doctor<00:04:52.169> hi<00:04:53.040> and

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
years ago who he's a great doctor hi and

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.640 
years ago who he's a great doctor hi and
he<00:04:53.639> came<00:04:53.910> in<00:04:54.120> second<00:04:54.780> in<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.260> hundred-yard

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.560 
he came in second in the hundred-yard
under<00:04:56.310> meter<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.760> guess<00:04:57.000> was<00:04:57.150> hundred<00:04:57.360> yards

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
under meter I guess was hundred yards

under meter I guess was hundred yards
back<00:04:57.720> then<00:04:57.960> in<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.200> in<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.290> Olympics<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.860> the
