today the first thing you need to know

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.470 
today the first thing you need to know
in<00:00:10.170> tuning<00:00:10.769> any<00:00:10.920> string<00:00:11.610> instrument<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.210> what

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
in tuning any string instrument is what

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.539 
in tuning any string instrument is what
pitches<00:00:12.690> you're<00:00:12.960> looking<00:00:13.259> for<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
pitches you're looking for and the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.980 
pitches you're looking for and the
violin<00:00:15.320> has<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.650> strings<00:00:17.010> e<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:18.320> D<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.680> G<00:00:20.990> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
violin has the strings e a D and G you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.640 
violin has the strings e a D and G you
may<00:00:22.140> use<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> pitch<00:00:23.130> pipe<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:24.439> find<00:00:25.439> those

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
may use a pitch pipe to find those

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.670 
may use a pitch pipe to find those
particular<00:00:25.949> notes<00:00:27.019> for<00:00:28.019> example<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.439> with

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
particular notes for example here with

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.849 
particular notes for example here with
the<00:00:28.769> e<00:00:28.800> sounds<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:31.470> would<00:00:31.619> tune

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the e sounds like and you would tune

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.850 
the e sounds like and you would tune
until<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.840> get<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> sound<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.500> exactly

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
until you get the sound that is exactly

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.580 
until you get the sound that is exactly
like<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.219> particular<00:00:35.730> pitch<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.809> you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
like that particular pitch if you're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.010 
like that particular pitch if you're
tuning<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.010> viola<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> cello<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.660> pictures

tuning a viola or a cello the pictures
you're<00:00:40.140> looking<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.100> D<00:00:41.989> G<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> C

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you're looking for would be a D G and C

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
you're looking for would be a D G and C
and<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.090> also<00:00:45.210> pitch<00:00:45.570> pipes<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and there are also pitch pipes that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
and there are also pitch pipes that
correspond<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.890> those<00:00:47.250> particular

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
correspond with those particular

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260 
correspond with those particular
instruments<00:00:48.530> also<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.620> you're<00:00:49.770> tuning<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.399> base

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
instruments also if you're tuning a base

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810 
instruments also if you're tuning a base
a<00:00:51.719> base<00:00:52.289> since<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> bigger<00:00:53.129> instrument<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a base since it's a bigger instrument is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
a base since it's a bigger instrument is
tuned<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.960> bit<00:00:55.050> differently<00:00:55.440> it's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
tuned a little bit differently it's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459 
tuned a little bit differently it's
tuned<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.949> forces<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> fifth<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.469> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
tuned in forces that a fifth and it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
tuned in forces that a fifth and it
starts<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> lowest<00:00:59.309> string<00:00:59.760> being<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.239> e

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
starts with the lowest string being an e

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.280 
starts with the lowest string being an e
then<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.800> D<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.059> highest<00:01:03.480> string<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> G<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
then a D in the highest string is G it's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.510 
then a D in the highest string is G it's
just<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> violin<00:01:05.040> strings<00:01:05.339> backwards<00:01:06.320> as<00:01:07.520> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
just the violin strings backwards as I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.250 
just the violin strings backwards as I
mentioned<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.180> use<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> pitch<00:01:09.780> pipe<00:01:10.020> in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
mentioned you can use a pitch pipe in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
mentioned you can use a pitch pipe in
that<00:01:10.380> way<00:01:10.530> you'd<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.400> ear<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that way you'd have to use your ear to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.890 
that way you'd have to use your ear to
hear<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> sound<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.799> correct<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.070> an

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
hear if the sound is correct or not an

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.510 
hear if the sound is correct or not an
even<00:01:15.900> better<00:01:16.140> way<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
even better way would be to have a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
even better way would be to have a
digital<00:01:18.180> or<00:01:18.689> electronic<00:01:19.220> chromatic<00:01:20.220> tuner

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

turn this screw to the right makes it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
turn this screw to the right makes it
higher<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.399> pitch<00:01:53.579> sharper<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.509> the

tuners the one thing you need to be
careful<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.700> however<00:02:17.150> when<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.390> use<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.750> fine

careful of however when you use the fine
tuners<00:02:18.319> is<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:19.100> if<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.340> tune<00:02:19.610> them<00:02:19.850> too

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
tuners is that if you tune them too

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.720 
tuners is that if you tune them too
tightly<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.380> right<00:02:21.680> there's<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.489> little

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
you how a digital tuner works with the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.490 
you how a digital tuner works with the
fine<00:02:37.489> tuners<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:39.650> we<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:40.010> zoom<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:42.769> here

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
fine tuners if we can zoom in here

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.750 
fine tuners if we can zoom in here
what's<00:02:45.500> nice<00:02:45.680> about<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:46.100> tuner<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.640> will

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
what's nice about this tuner is it will

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.810 
what's nice about this tuner is it will
actually<00:02:46.940> tell<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.690> pitch<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.350> you're

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
actually tell you the pitch that you're

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.220 
actually tell you the pitch that you're
tuning<00:02:49.820> if<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.870> notice<00:02:51.170> there<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.560> says<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.980> and

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.150 
to take a string and make it a lot out
of<00:03:18.019> tune<00:03:20.860> ok<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.010> would<00:03:22.250> be<00:03:22.430> your<00:03:23.769> D<00:03:24.769> string

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
of tune ok this would be your D string

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.050 
of tune ok this would be your D string
and<00:03:26.120> it's<00:03:26.299> very<00:03:26.570> attitude<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:27.380> take<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.060> and

and it's very attitude and I take it and

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.330 
and it's very attitude and I take it and
I<00:03:29.269> turn<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.870> right<00:03:29.989> cuz<00:03:30.500> very<00:03:30.860> flat

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
I turn it to the right cuz very flat

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.270 
I turn it to the right cuz very flat
just<00:03:31.579> keeps<00:03:32.030> saying<00:03:32.360> C<00:03:32.690> sharp<00:03:33.049> now<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.829> says<00:03:34.010> d

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
just keeps saying C sharp now it says d

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:44.260 
just keeps saying C sharp now it says d
but<00:03:34.549> it's<00:03:34.730> still<00:03:35.000> flat<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:38.239> getting<00:03:38.510> closer

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.080 

and<00:03:45.020> now<00:03:45.230> there<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.590> go<00:03:45.740> your<00:03:46.460> D<00:03:46.640> string<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.000> in

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
and now there you go your D string is in

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.830 
and now there you go your D string is in
tune<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:48.050> that's<00:03:48.980> how<00:03:49.100> fine<00:03:49.370> tutors<00:03:49.730> work<00:03:50.000> on

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
tune and that's how fine tutors work on

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.630 
tune and that's how fine tutors work on
a<00:03:50.900> violin<00:03:51.500> viola<00:03:52.100> cello<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:53.120> even<00:03:53.300> on<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.420> base
