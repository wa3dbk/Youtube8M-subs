00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.880
 the driver of the car brought us here 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.099
 he brings in has not quite 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.629
 loved his car is missing one 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.879
 large part of the sheet metal on the 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.550

 front bumper more than tomorrow arrangements 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.140
 changes year of construction 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.260
 the condition of the car attracts attention 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.200
 from our police officers and yes the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 car must go to the side story 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.710
 is dangerous 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.780
 Yes 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.360
 good afternoon you will have noticed 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.940
 that you are missing some parts of the car 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.280
 if you are driving in the city ​​and you would like one 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 pedestrian collide 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.579
 In the past you only had that fries cutter 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.430
 throw in a big potato and then 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.470
 the potato can divide the other deep into 12 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.000
 from 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.879
 so you can do it a little bit for yourself 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.550
 imagine times four fingers 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.440
 if we help make it insists 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.909
 it also says it makes me do 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.100
 having these are those thresholds one 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.020
 row of sporty cars they have that too 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.190
 based on organization and or 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.929
 slowly over the tribbles 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.550
 he is by the way buying boys like 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.110
 you are interested at ctg 6000 euros 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.410
 america well when advertising okay that make 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.910
 It will arrive the new bulk on your leave it 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.830
 as quickly as possible 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.270
 this is not a face at all 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.800
 take a look at the tires because they can 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.800
 lommel but that's why I tell them 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.920
 can normally go through just twice quickly 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.750
 nice at the traffic lights 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.620
 no don't do it no more street races 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.000
 more no 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.570
 and we are taken away woman okay well 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.370
 thank you 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.950
 you see she can understand 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.200
 but because years are deeper there is no end 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.270
 some protruding parts but yes 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.940
 even though your bumper is on it and you drive 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.530
 someone is just as dangerous as you 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.810
 Tell someone if you're on a 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.650
 with 30 to 20 kilometers per hour really comes 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.570
 almost a year 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.550
 it does break it is likely to do 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.050
 as good as if you just have to be good anymore 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.460
 you can roll with those movements 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.950
 maybe good then come out moon 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.600
 so then it's just about this bumper 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.210
 is also because of those thresholds and that's how it is 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.010
 just see broken off 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.420
 the high threshold then keeps being through it 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.850
 water then really get that whole 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.680
 deep v shapes in those just beginning 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.360
 from that threshold yes that you come in and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.650
 is just about 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.390
 breaks into pieces so you have to get there 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.950
 really economical with it yes that is indeed 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.900
 a very good way to get your whole 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 to lose the front bumper 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 well i am that whole bumper in principle 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.610
 not lost can be removed and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.180
 then i was looking for new ones 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.090
 bumpers 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
 yes american import car quite difficult 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.630
 to come and have a parts here 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.920
 you like that tuning company I want 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.170
 again bumpers but those are all 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.520
 of that year too many air happers one 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.290
 and you name it all but it is just like that 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.630
 a little too much for my feeling 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.100
 I like tight a bit more and I have to 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.630
 just to fit in the car 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.550
 I finally decided on that 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.290
 cut off the bumper by half 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.400
 I just have a lip via the internet 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.620
 ordered 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.150
 say ran a sports race that is 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.430
 say put it under the bumper 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.850
 which makes it look a bit more aggressive 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.980
 gets 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.140
 so i just fill it myself 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 reassembled with fiberglass and 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.500
 putty and etcetera etcetera very much 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.080
 work emotion feeling 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.610
 everything is there intimate and the end 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.920
 the result is impressive and you do that 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.780
 finally for you creates something that is yes 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.950
 what you have built yourself 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.640
 So that's the debt that just one 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 nice painting market yes built yourself 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.390
 painted number for me it built 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.570
 yes so the standard question but we 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 do ask why this car 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.989
 I have no idea it's just 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.610
 actually you see something if you have one 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.840
 lovely lady adorns the yourself 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.190
 somehow attracted to 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.510
 its without you actually knowing of it 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.489
 hey why do i feel anyway 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.720
 attracted to there maybe the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.519
 personality that they come things 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.340
 all later but when beautiful ladies 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.940
 looks is also how i saw that car 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.940
 is that so 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.880
 I kind of see my own 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.380
 personality in that car is sporty 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.330
 weird 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.740
 just a little messy 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.420
 everything together 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.950
 i like special things and that will come 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.100
 back in that car 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.580
 I am also quite careful with good tidy 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.660
 Keep up 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.790
 just beautiful twice a week 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.190

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.040
 to us you in the next cabinet 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.780
 infrastructure minister is going a bit 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.329
 then be the first to tackle 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.540
 thresholds I understand for the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.130
 children safety but then made 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.960
 common for cars that they are the 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.460
 do you want to maintain them then this is not yet 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.020
 such a very super expensive car my strong one 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.590
 mere lamborgini I have the money there 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.300
 for the I have to pass here is also 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.450
 agree to the large oz 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 so everything yes just say broken 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.419
 is also just very quiet about one 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.280
 which makes people behind me worse 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.220
 yes i like that i am not going all the way 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.050
