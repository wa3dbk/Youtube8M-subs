00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello I'll introduce the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.330
 operation of an automated system 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.639
 opening and closing for works 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.269
 of hen house this system is very simple 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 since it consists of basic elements 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 findable in any 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 supermarket 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.410
 it is indeed composed of an old 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.039
 drill a few wheels 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.250
 rubber of a simple switch is going 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.699
 and comes and wooden planks for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.410
 frame and gears 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.350
 there is no water tomatoes no relay 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 no electronic systems 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.079
 the mechanical part the training and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.200
 made by a drill on which a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.789
 Angle gear was fixed from a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.559
 old grinder at the end of this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.200
 unhappy a maybe or a little 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 rubber caster the set is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.110
 floating climb on a system sends 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 which slides in wooden rails on 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.020
 all lubricated paraffin a big 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.969
 stone was stuck on top of this 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.729
 system to apply pressure 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.159
 permanent vertical and so catch up 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.430
 the game and to prevent Angolans from 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.430
 slips 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 this together the motor drives via a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.320
 small roulette that is not visible 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 behind a big galette 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 intermediate plywood on this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 big intermediate slab a small 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.110
 roulette was secured jointly by 5 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 aims 4 30 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.479
 the interest of this cake is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.909
 to increase the torque is to decrease the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.250
 speed is a reducer 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.420
 this big intermediate slab is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.220
 also mounted floating 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 she has a two centimeter 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.140
 about vertical that allows him to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.170
 constantly follow the final patty 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.399
 is to compensate for wear 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 the central dumpling of this great 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.250
 intermediate galette between them feasted 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.530
 final with a diameter of about 45 cm 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.229
 which corresponds to the amplitude of the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.229
 hatch actuate the final patty 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.879
 revolves around an axis made with a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.520
 nut that is fixed and that is securely 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.220
 fixed on the wooden structure 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:23.130
 on this final galette we find the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.580
 notch of the cable on the one hand and two wedges 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.030
 in wood 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 on the other hand which serve to toggle the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.780
 come and go 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190
 alternatively the reductions of 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.510
 speed 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.800
 the drill rotates at 750 rpm 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.110
 it is connected to a bevel 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.650
 leader who turns to 250 laps 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.860
 minute reduction a third the whole 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.050
 drives the intermediate slab that 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.150
 rotates at 25 revolutions minute 1/10 reduction 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.420
 and this intermediate slab drives 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.810
 the final galette turns at 2.5 turns 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.740
 minute or ten big seconds for 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.310
 an opening or closing part 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.150
 electric 2 socket are 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.830
 permanently powered by 220 volts 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.410
 on these two plugs we connected two 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.330
 commercial programmers that of the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.150
 descent sending the current during a 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.060
 quarter of an hour in the evening at 9:30 pm and that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.910
 of the rise sending current during a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.090
 quarter of an hour every morning at 7 am 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.560
 the phase son of each of these 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.489
 programmers go through the back and forth 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.760
 that you see here 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.350
 its function is twofold firstly it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.480
 open the circuit so they cut the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.820
 running at the end of a half turn as soon as 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.739
 the cable just tipped 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.049
 on the other hand they close circuit the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.220
 circuit for the other programmer 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.370
 thus making the system ready for 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.560
 work for the next half turn 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.549
 so in summary the coming and going possesses 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.110
 two inputs and one output that goes to 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.670
 the Serbian lecam drill has rocked 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.980
 the switch so choose the input 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.160
 active and in fact to inactivate our 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.170
 input the sons of our are as to 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.320
 they all connected permanently and everywhere 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.030
 they too at the drill the demonstration 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.380
 to avoid waiting for the night we 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.959
 let's simulate the triggering of the 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.370
 closing programmer we see 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.990
 here that the eighth of the cable is in 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.259
 position 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.539
 back away so the cable is stretched so 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.940
 the hatch is open 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.470
 It is 21:30 the programmer sending the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.470
 current in its circuit which is closed 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.350
 after a half turn uncam switches the 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.449
 back and forth opens the downhill circuit and 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.710
 closes the circuit mounted as the 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.770
 programmer to ride does not see any 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.270
 still current the motor stops 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.000
 now imagine that the night is 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.910
 past and that we would do in the morning at 7am 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.610
 the programmer to get on the track of 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.820
 current the circuit is locked up the motor 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.820
 is powered 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.010
 after half a turn another range 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.690
 rocking back and forth again opens 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.670
 the circuits mount the engine stops 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.900
 and the downhill circuit is closed features 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.520
 for the future of better evening rotation 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.790
 complete cycle and takes and rap properly 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.590
 said 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.690
 we will now put the two 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.190
 programmers in a forced march what 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.710
 will have the effect of running without 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.850
 end the system and we will go study the 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.090
 the hatch and 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.090
 pulleys 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.029
 the cable is connected to the big galette 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.029
 who pays gives back and forth 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.329
 for maintenance reasons the 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.179
 system is in the house while the 

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:34.569
 hen house and 15 meters from the house 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:34.569
 a cord 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.379
 past 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.649
 along the skin between the door of the 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:41.649
 masonry 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:51.250
 the rope arrives golden role the 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.450
 lintel and connected to a rope that passes 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.960
 in a pulley that serves as a reference 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:59.190
 angle rope rope over 15 meters of 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.190
 along the henhouse 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.080
 on the henhouse there are two rails 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.480
 says in the hatch 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.660
 a second hen i which serves as a referral 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.720
 angle and a counterweight to lighten 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.630
 the system we can see the hatch up 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.460
 and get off driven by the engine that gets 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.100
 located 15 meters away in the garage 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.810
 of the House 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.560
 thank you for your attention for all 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:38.990
