00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.860
 guys i started with youtube by 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.690
 Gijs 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.539
 I thought it was always fun to play games 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.520
 and I am just about your goat with me 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.570
 record call of duty me 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.619
 and then that separates something like that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.479
 of course the emperor youtube started 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.609
 channel with gameplay videos and I advice 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 from a yes that seems pretty laughing to me 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.240
 to do 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.979
 and that's how I am at the game portal 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.109
 come about yoga is because you are something 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.369
 said from jeffrey yes you must have one here 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:49.409
 send video to and then yes then you must 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.799
 you see what they think 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.479
 well and that's how i am with her 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.759
 prayers go to then one 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.740
 game channel coming i was the fourth of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:05.039
 January 2012 started my channel and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.679
 January 9, 2012 is that I am at one 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.220
 game channel so that was another one 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.800
 quite fast but I do it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.020
 still having fun with it 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.430
 I'm not the most popular guy 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.720
 on Youtube 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.400
 that is mainly due to game music 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 game I have a distinct taste of games 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.900
 I'm not like everyone else 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.900
 just playing the popular games 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.360
 I want to do but on my channel 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.140
 didn't work because so many people already 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.030
 who play games 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.970
 so i have some other variation i do the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.349
 what less popular games and 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.840
 therefore I am still under 7 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.909
 among the ten cheese apps 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.140
 Yes, there was often the permits and 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.709
 as you can see i also have one 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.379
 very new 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.450
 a job on my car this is me 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.200
 accidentally seen through the internet this is it 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.200
 trunk a job 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.879
 oh shit only the trumpet sees a job 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.690
 the are wrath and yet a little nicer 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.780
 from 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.579
 that is a pity that is a great pity 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.190
 on his torno this paintjob looks like 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.780
 a whole lot cooler and base odor 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.549
 but that doesn't matter because 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.569
 that will go if I can ever have his wrath 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.569
 to buy 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.230
 sometime then i will go anyway 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.230
 also indicate your 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.400
 with this is wanting longer 2 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.680
 no can't guide my car has 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.970
 just also a new a new ever it 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.819
 new and jurgen got the line curled 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 is faster for this race 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:41.290
 I also get quite a few minis 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.169
 and with that and me nothing yes I can enjoy 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.849
 upgrade my shit 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.269
 I actually wanted is for this car and 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.040
 nappy laaf make a job but then you have to 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.310
 you want to have your hot pink and then you have to 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.310
 the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.890
 oh have a billion little ones before and then 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.490
 I still have 48 turbo boost at races 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.370
 when doing it you will not succeed me 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:12.250
 just don't miss a two three 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:16.120
 so yes but in the next the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.450
 next race i will do the qware 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.079
 and continue so I see you 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.240
 in a moment 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.000
 so there we are again in race 2 what 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.440
 jumps around leaves but I'm going right 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.320
 continue with the cure no the next 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.030
 question comes from pixel hd nl which come early 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.140
 I sometimes go in swollen and what I find there 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.790
 from 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.110
 I can't say anything about that I am too 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.790
 never been in zwolle in my entire 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.950
 so you can't say what i am 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.560
 found is that point 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.290
 and I actually have nothing at all 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.120
 search in zwolle so i don't think so either 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:52.570
 that I will get there very soon then we will go 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.750
 continue with the question of ariana grande de 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.750
 to 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.830
 who did you meet through through 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.290
 youtube 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.130
 oh that's a good question because i have 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.360
 quite a lot 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.910

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.940

 meet david extra yes it is whole 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.540
 hard to say i have so many people 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.060
 get to know certainly also the last time 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.320
 at the dip youtube knowledge at the what of 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.440
 fiction books 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.210
 at the david party i also have 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.910
 anyway what more people get to know than 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.050
 that I had before so yes it is for 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.160
 very difficult to say 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.460
 and who I all know 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.380
 yes it is just difficult to do that for a while 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.820
 to articulate 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.490
 let's just say that not enough 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.770
 are people who know at the moment 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:52.230
 oh no no no no really beautiful and then the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.970
 question from harm

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.260
 I had already responded 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.200
 this race is all you can search through 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.210
 the social club website when you get there 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.330

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.330

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.410
 ok and then you do the job then you can 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.910
 bake these races and then you can 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.860
 You can simply add a given moment 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.930
 you must then search for all publishers 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.090
 and then just enter a tag I do 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.730

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.910
