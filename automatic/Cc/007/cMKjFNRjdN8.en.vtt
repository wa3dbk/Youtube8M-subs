00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
 at 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.480
 she knew everyone knows but said 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.369
 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.770
 find for a little tutorial on the raid 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.689
 a core 2 intended therefore the vault of 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.369
 glass so we had already done a series 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.289
 little tutorial for the version raid 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.460
 normal especially as it should be known that 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.650
 are two three little things that 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.150
 change in hardcore mode and especially 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.470
 on the tables of oracles 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.420
 so I do not know yet if we're going 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.460
 do the bergen step if you ever 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 need tips and tricks 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.910
 information on this step is well 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.830
 do not hesitate to send me messages 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.269
 private or comments below 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.980
 this video like that well all 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.720
 just that I think we will make a 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.180
 video in response to the number of messages 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.670
 we will receive on the stage of the sea fans 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.290
 now regarding oracles 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.839
 well it's just after the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.280
 tear so the three rips nothing 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.019
 of a good witch protect you 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.640
 tears and you go up to 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.990
 whenever the Templar invokes his 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.600
 legions it is not really necessary 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 to do a tutorial about it so we 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.830
 stopped on the stage of oracles and 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 in particular we applied since the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.150
 start a strategy that comes from 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.369
 almerys 33 which is currently at my 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 eyes the best strategies for the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.040
 hardcore mode 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.010
 so this is a method kane &amp; rice a 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.650
 invented in June I would say so very 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.270
 diligent to destine you here he is he has 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.220
 revealed all his qualities he spent 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.110
 a night on this method I believe in 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.790
 search the arithmetic of oracles 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.130
 and so he made us a little painting 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.210
 which is my super explicit faith so 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.490
 here I wanted to do a little 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.659
 video about it i will put you the link 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.860
 of the chain del neri this in the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.630
 description do not hesitate to go do 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.670
 a little trick he did a lot of pretty 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.570
 records / destiny already so I you 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.610
 invite to visit them 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.220
 pending regarding his picture 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.180
 so seen like that it does not speak to you and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.340
 you will see that there is a logic 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.229
 very very very interesting 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.090
 impressive even so already it takes 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.820
 know he isolated the seven sequences 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.760
 of oracle and so he has missed assigning a 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.770
 number to each oracle 7 years ago 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.470
 all and they will spawn up to seven 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.569
 times by forming this different range 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.400
 before going deeper and more 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.110
 in detail on this table he will have to 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.760
 talk about different positions 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.269
 oracle and that's why I invite you 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.040
 to watch this little this graphic I 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.780
 will be I do not really know how the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 key she feeds she did 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.700
 just represents this 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.600
 position 17 different oracle who are going 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.220
 spawn in the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.320
 al of the Templar so it's relatively 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.090
 accurate I think he really great 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.590
 well worked on this technique and if 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.970
 never ben voila if you want 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.200
 thank for that you will see 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240
 that this method it will allow you 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.890
 clearly to spend the time bent to 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.910
 sure do not hesitate to go far 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.590
 a little visit 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.930
 so as you can see you have 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.060
 17 oracle spread throughout the amap is everything 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.460
 simply have to assign a 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.440
 position to each player to cover 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.150
 all the oracles so with regard to 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.070
 regards the positions it's not good 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.080
 wizard that's going to depend only on 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.300
 you and your abilities and everything 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.100
 just from your gambling habits we 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.110
 regards we are used to leaving two 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.850
 people at the very top of the pillar so he 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.370
 must of course be let die 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.050
 at the beginning of the game so leave you 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.820
 two people at the very top of the pillar and 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.010
 these two people will take care of 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.870
 oracles 1 2 and 4 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.360
 then you have a second person 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.950
 who will stay in the middle of the map 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.140
 I had to deal with both mobs 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.730
 and oracle 3 and you should know that 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.940
 this person can also be a 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.620
 support for oracles 7 6 and 4 if 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.270
 you never get overwhelmed 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.100
 now regarding positions 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.540
 of the other three people and well they 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.830
 are just going to be right 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.350
 so you'll understand there will be 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.940
 nobody on the left of the map and so 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.410
 these three people are entitled that they 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.330
 are going to be at the level of the cave where he 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.670
 there is the biggest spawn all the way down to 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.620
 right and so they will cover 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.270
 there will be a person who will take charge 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.070
 to kill all modes that go to pop 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.650
 and the other two people will be 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.510
 loaded with oracle 7 6 and 5 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.550
 with this method and with a good 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.200
 cohesion and good communication in 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.300
 your team you should logically 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.800
 go through this step very quickly and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.330
 without any difficulty 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.740
 so we come back to the table for 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.900
 finish what will allow you to 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.850
 better understand this table announces you 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.340
 simply the order of appearance of 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.720
 oracles sequence after sequence in 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.239
 first sequence you will have the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.330
 would have that 1 4 and 5 that makes this pole in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.350
 second sequence the oracles 2 6 7 etc 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.150
 etc. 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.190
 so watch out if this method that 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.290
 you look very very simple like that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.330
 know that when you arrive at the 6th 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.250
 and in the seventh sequence it becomes a little 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.570
 faster but a little more sporty and there 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.610
 we will have to be much more 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.590
 concentrated and much more reactive 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.720
 to be able to overcome both 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.580
 last oracle sequences a 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.639
 last little thing to avoid to 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.199
 the future to all 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.180
 who will follow this method of having to 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.789
 relaunch this video each time for 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.530
 get the order of appearance of the oracles 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.539
 I also put you in touch in the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.819
 description the plot of a small image 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.650
 which contains both the chart is the 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.219
 position of the six players for the seven 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.050
 different 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.999
 oracle so here do not hesitate to keep 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.560
 this link in memory to go back to 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.330
 every time you will be at this stage 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.650
 that's it for this little method 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.689
 do not hesitate to tell us what you 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.159
 think in comment and I remember 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.990
 if you wish to visit the chain of 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.490
 the author his link is all 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.319
 simply in the description 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.300
 a big thanks to anne erize for us 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.889
 to have shared this technique I 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.419
 do very very big kisses and I will 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.800
 see you soon for more tips 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.099
 on destiny 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.099
 ciao
