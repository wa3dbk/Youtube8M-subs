here is made of plastic there are no

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.090 
here is made of plastic there are no
metal<00:04:12.870> parts<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.320> this<00:04:13.470> everything<00:04:13.800> looks

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
metal parts in this everything looks

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.130 
metal parts in this everything looks
pretty<00:04:14.280> durable<00:04:14.640> too<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.210> pretty<00:04:15.480> solid

pretty durable too it's pretty solid

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.860 
pretty durable too it's pretty solid
so<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.609> age<00:04:17.730> base<00:04:18.030> seems<00:04:18.359> pretty<00:04:18.570> right

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
so the the age base seems pretty right

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.660 
so the the age base seems pretty right
for<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.230> nothing<00:04:19.680> seems<00:04:19.950> like<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.310> will<00:04:20.430> just

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
for this nothing seems like it will just

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.850 
for this nothing seems like it will just
you<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.120> fall<00:04:21.480> apart<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.200> durability<00:04:22.620> of

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
you know fall apart so the durability of

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.950 
you know fall apart so the durability of
this<00:04:23.040> is<00:04:23.310> pretty<00:04:23.550> high<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.090> like<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> little

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
place with the fetch and it looks like

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.720 
place with the fetch and it looks like
