was<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> long<00:00:13.019> line<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.259> these<00:00:13.590> trucks<00:00:14.929> we<00:00:18.740> see

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
was a long line of these trucks we see

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.730 
was a long line of these trucks we see
if<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.990> middle<00:00:22.500> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
if you can see that the middle of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
if you can see that the middle of
nowhere<00:00:23.010> Granite<00:00:23.369> City<00:00:26.449> you<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:27.779> have

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
nowhere Granite City you see they have

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
nowhere Granite City you see they have
lots<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> coils<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.340> that's<00:00:31.430> kind<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lots of coils here and that's kind of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
lots of coils here and that's kind of
what<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.790> truck<00:00:33.030> looks<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.420> except<00:00:33.870> mine<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
what my truck looks like except mine is

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.530 
what my truck looks like except mine is
shotgun<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> side<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.760> by<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
shotgun that is I to the side and by the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
shotgun that is I to the side and by the
looks<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.860> coil<00:00:41.219> may<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
looks of it I think my coil may be a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.840 
looks of it I think my coil may be a
little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.030> bigger<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:44.040> always<00:00:44.340> important

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
little bit bigger it's always important

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
little bit bigger it's always important
so<00:00:45.800> we'll<00:00:46.800> drop<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.190> off<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.750> we

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so we'll drop this off and see what we

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.860 
so we'll drop this off and see what we
get<00:00:49.050> next<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> clouds<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:51.030> covering<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
get next the clouds are covering up so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
get next the clouds are covering up so
I'm<00:00:52.050> hoping<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.829> coil<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.520> front

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
I'm hoping they get this coil in front

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
I'm hoping they get this coil in front
of<00:00:53.760> me<00:00:53.820> off<00:00:53.910> real<00:00:54.149> quick<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.989> inside

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
of me off real quick so I can get inside

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.150 
of me off real quick so I can get inside
before<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.910> starts<00:00:57.210> sprinkling<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.469> mean<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
before it starts sprinkling I mean it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
before it starts sprinkling I mean it
the<00:00:59.399> clouds<00:00:59.609> aren't<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.000> thick<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the clouds aren't that thick because you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.009 
the clouds aren't that thick because you
can<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> Sun<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> clouds<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
can see the Sun through the clouds so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
can see the Sun through the clouds so
let's<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.010> go<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:06.330> not<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
let's see there you go see it's not that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
let's see there you go see it's not that
bad<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> what's<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
bad but you know what's up it's that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.359 
bad but you know what's up it's that
cloudiness<00:01:09.180> effect<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> makes<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.140> nervous

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
cloudiness effect that makes you nervous

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.440 
cloudiness effect that makes you nervous

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in in fact you can you can see my coil

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.260 
in in fact you can you can see my coil
right<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.229> need<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> come<00:01:19.770> off

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
right there I need to come off

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.830 
right there I need to come off
I'll<00:01:21.270> pull<00:01:21.659> straight<00:01:22.470> ahead<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.840> they'll

I'll pull straight ahead and they'll

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.249 
I'll pull straight ahead and they'll
hook<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.700> then<00:01:26.700> I'll<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.820> done<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.420> we'll

there's a boards underneath here I've
got<00:02:11.670> skidded<00:02:12.670> coils<00:02:13.270> four<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.780> them<00:02:14.490> 46,000

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
got skidded coils four of them 46,000

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.380 
got skidded coils four of them 46,000
pounds

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
pounds

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.410
