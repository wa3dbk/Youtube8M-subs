here<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> practicing<00:01:32.549> trying

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
here is you got to be practicing trying

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
here is you got to be practicing trying
to<00:01:33.030> catch<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> board<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.110> front<00:01:34.380> foot

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to catch the board with your front foot

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
to catch the board with your front foot
rather<00:01:35.130> than<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:35.790> foot<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:37.020> can

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
rather than your back foot as you can

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
rather than your back foot as you can
notice<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.549> body<00:01:38.790> jumps<00:01:39.210> forward<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
notice your your body jumps forward and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
notice your your body jumps forward and
then<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.229> front<00:01:40.470> foot<00:01:40.530> comes<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.490> then

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
then your front foot comes off and then

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
then your front foot comes off and then
your<00:01:42.060> back<00:01:42.240> foot<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> stays<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
your back foot kind of stays up in the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
your back foot kind of stays up in the
air<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> catches<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> board<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.479> fine

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
air and catches a board which is fine

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
air and catches a board which is fine
but<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:46.979> board<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:48.180> out

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but you got to get the board going out

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
but you got to get the board going out
more<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.750> front<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> less<00:01:50.159> behind<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
more in front of you and less behind you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.910 
more in front of you and less behind you
obviously<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.930> mean<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.290> basically<00:01:52.530> what

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
obviously I mean that's basically what

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
obviously I mean that's basically what
you<00:01:53.009> said<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.380> cool<00:01:55.380> so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you said so you do know that cool so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.639 
you said so you do know that cool so
this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.790> probably<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> biggest<00:01:57.649> problem

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this is probably the biggest problem

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.280 
this is probably the biggest problem
that<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.070> people<00:01:59.700> having<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.299> 360<00:02:00.840> flips<00:02:01.110> on

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that I see people having on 360 flips on

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
that I see people having on 360 flips on
their<00:02:01.320> first<00:02:01.590> learning<00:02:01.860> them<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:03.119> kind

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
their first learning them and it's kind

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.649 
their first learning them and it's kind
of<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.740> hard<00:02:04.740> thing<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> explain<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.479> when
