00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone is guillaume and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.890
 I'm happy to meet you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.530
 for this new commented gameplay in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.910
 infected either the map village then you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.049
 have understood that when it was 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.719
 to infect is because I played alone 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 and generally I offer you a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 gameplay with a m 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.840
 at first I do not spoil at all 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.570
 part but we'll see later 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.810
 but she went pretty pretty short so 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.689
 we start with a peace 90 m in one 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 a killing in the online game and there 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.800
 it's true that when you're in 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 face it's quite difficult for the guy 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.430
 to kill you the technique of the beginning 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.290
 phillies and someone to avoid getting 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 get killed if he ever gets affected 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.670
 or to kill the first one if you ever 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.360
 are infected is that way it avoids you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.360
 to be infected in your turn and and that's it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 so as usual the beginning of the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.230
 part it does not happen much 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.079
 because he necessarily has only one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.480
 for 17 17 guys here he just got 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 kill right in front so necessarily 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 well if you get to see him it's that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 you're very lucky 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.990
 so I'm going to do my little ones but 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 little round like that until when you 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 es 1 2 3 4 5 and the people at home but 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.619
 good it's not right now 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.960
 short so this part p 90 cm 1 that I 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.150
 were playing all the time with in mode 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.890
 silence this quick shot but it's true 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.540
 that since some time I 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.460
 stopped it because I do not know they 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.850
 have made a recent update 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.750
 and well I do not know they have they have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.060
 lowered the door the impact of the damage 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.939
 weapons is pretty special special 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.290
 sorry I saw that the number of 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.960
 shots 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.640
 because shotgun launched with the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920
 large capacity chargers and is the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.240
 same as with the normal load so the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 games have rocketed a good become more 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.410
 in addition complicated finally short is enough 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.640
 weird got up I do not have 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.920
 download the elite pack because 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.360
 because I do not have it yet I do not play 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160
 enough in fact for to download the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.750
 pack is saying right now I'm trying to 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.399
 to avoid playing and there they 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.570
 reappear the two in front of me so 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.780
 it's pretty cool zavesca so that's 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.010
 it's even cooler in fact and brief 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.160
 shaded so I did not buy the pack 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.330
 elite why because 60 euros or 50 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.370
 euros I even know how much was 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.990
 excuse me if I'm wrong but for 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.480
 have all the taste buds the maps in 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.709
 before premiere, her fairy beats in the end 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.980
 makes 140 euros the video game 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.590
 so good I'm not going 5 to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.410
 rotorua m for 1 for a call of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.480
 knowing that the maps that are basic are 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.180
 very good are very good and especially there 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.489
 if we add weapon games as 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.410
 in call of duty and I find that rather 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.180
 cool because it's really a 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.080
 a game mode where I played all the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.600
 time so I think I'll 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.280
 proposed weapons stakes gameplay 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 there I nearly killed there and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.760
 luckily with my teammate 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.330
 thank you very much I 'm doing a little 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.030
 dedication to guillaume 52nd who play with 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.830
 me making it the ipad administrator 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.130
 and from the page the kings of the web on 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.310
 facebook who actually is a page 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.630
 which includes norman cyprian etc 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.370
 finally all the kings of the web 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.990
 I mean by that I mean by that 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.500
 and that is what they do over 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.940
 views on youtube as french to 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.980
 share a short war we are not there 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.300
 to talk about comic podcasters 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.510
 is not we are here to talk about call 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.000
 of 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.670
 and that's when the game goes 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.670
 to complicate oneself effectively one is more 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.380
 that nineteen now 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.760
 and here I will stay here in mode 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.490
 go ahead touch me well we are 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.980
 well and in fact I escaped death 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.150
 three times so there I am not wrong I 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.710
 see that there are my teammates behind 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.620
 who covers so I put myself cowardly 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.850
 still does a recharge game is watching you 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.880
 always my teammates we are more than 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.880
 4 against 12 so it gets tight it's 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:04.370
 to say super tight 2 3 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.680
 you had the jelly not stole at flat eal4 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.820
 and there I could have been killed two 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.350
 times five six seven or here there there I 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.660
 I'm not bad I 'm not good I'm 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:20.000
 not well I take a rock it's 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.200
 good but we were looking for three balls I 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.850
 know more about how much I am I must be 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.670
 at 2 3 kills beyond fashion is so a 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.190
 where there are more than three to moa 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.630
 to unlock I have time to launch it 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.830
 I bar bar I myself I am bar 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.560
 because it's going to be the first 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.330
 and I'm getting the officer had detonated 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.700
 one but extremist in extremis moa 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.470
 b gorgeous explodes 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.940
 I could still have a little chained 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.760
 but you will see that I will do 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.340
 my tata like to say to sochi and 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.810
 and here I am, I'm going to miss rolala 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.190
 wide and the agent could have very well 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.910
 to face both my teammate 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.710
 that you saw right is being killed 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.750
 and unfortunately I see one there and 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.680
 I made a little by little because of side 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.050
 I did not understand why 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.680
 in short a match and in addition he killed me 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.290
 at knife throwing brief a little 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.280
 from infected very nice where everything is 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.700
 goes into the last part 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.620
 but now so I hope the gameplay 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.230
 you liked it we will still see the 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.160
 score because the score shined that me 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.620
 does a little 40 2 1 which is rather 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.180
 not bad in terms of ratios I you
