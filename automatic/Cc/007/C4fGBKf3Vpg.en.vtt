so there is the aircraft right there so
let's<00:00:30.660> go<00:00:30.779> ahead<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.140> into<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> unboxing

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
let's go ahead and get into the unboxing

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.889 
let's go ahead and get into the unboxing
so<00:00:33.480> pop<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.780> open<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:36.890> pull<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.899> pops

aircraft<00:01:58.219> as<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.360> lot

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
aircraft as you can see it's a lot

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.850 
aircraft as you can see it's a lot
bigger<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> md<00:02:01.890> 10<00:02:02.479> side<00:02:03.479> by<00:02:03.659> side<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
bigger than the md 10 side by side you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.219 
bigger than the md 10 side by side you
can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.719> lot<00:02:06.719> lot<00:02:07.320> bigger<00:02:07.680> triple<00:02:08.310> seven

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
can see a lot lot bigger triple seven

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.170 
can see a lot lot bigger triple seven
but<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
but the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.289 
but the
md<00:02:12.900> 10<00:02:13.109> does<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.890> very<00:02:14.609> good<00:02:14.790> ranges

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
md 10 does have very good ranges

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.420 
md 10 does have very good ranges
yourself<00:02:15.629> from<00:02:15.750> statistics<00:02:16.469> but<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.189> triple

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
yourself from statistics but the triple

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.479 
yourself from statistics but the triple
7<00:02:17.640> also<00:02:17.790> has<00:02:18.090> its<00:02:18.620> positives<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:20.189> being<00:02:20.400> able

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
7 also has its positives of being able

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.069 
7 also has its positives of being able
to<00:02:20.609> carry<00:02:20.819> more<00:02:20.939> cargo<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:21.599> it's<00:02:21.810> of

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
to carry more cargo because it's of

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.380 
to carry more cargo because it's of
course<00:02:22.260> bigger<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.689> aircraft<00:02:25.200> is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
course bigger but this aircraft is

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.649 
course bigger but this aircraft is
fairly<00:02:27.390> big<00:02:27.719> it<00:02:27.930> gets<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> job<00:02:28.319> done<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.659> it

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
fairly big it gets the job done and it

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.110 
fairly big it gets the job done and it
looks<00:02:30.870> good<00:02:31.109> it<00:02:31.409> does<00:02:32.400> look<00:02:32.670> pretty<00:02:32.849> good<00:02:32.969> i

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
looks good it does look pretty good i
