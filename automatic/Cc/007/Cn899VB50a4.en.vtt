00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.170 
press our toes into the ground try to
straighten<00:03:07.830> our<00:03:08.040> knees<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.700> we're<00:03:09.000> going<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
straighten our knees so we're going to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.199 
straighten our knees so we're going to
contract<00:03:09.360> our<00:03:09.870> quads<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.850> when<00:03:11.850> we<00:03:11.970> do<00:03:12.180> that

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
contract our quads and when we do that

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.720 
contract our quads and when we do that
you'll<00:03:12.720> notice<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.070> inside<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
you'll notice that the inside of the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.970 
you'll notice that the inside of the
knee<00:03:14.880> muscle<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.570> vastus<00:03:15.959> medialis<00:03:16.260> obliquus

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
knee muscle the vastus medialis obliquus

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.390 
knee muscle the vastus medialis obliquus
VMO<00:03:17.720> gets<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.870> very<00:03:19.140> good<00:03:19.410> contraction<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.250> this

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
VMO gets a very good contraction so this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.750 
VMO gets a very good contraction so this
is<00:03:20.519> also<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:21.000> way<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.300> strengthen<00:03:21.900> our<00:03:22.320> knees<00:03:22.760> so

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
is also a way to strengthen our knees so

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.140 
is also a way to strengthen our knees so
when<00:03:24.030> we<00:03:24.120> rock<00:03:24.420> onto<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.230> balls<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.680> our<00:03:25.830> feet

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
when we rock onto the balls of our feet

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.090 
when we rock onto the balls of our feet
straighten<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.239> knees<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.780> squeeze<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
straighten the knees and squeeze the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.690 
straighten the knees and squeeze the
glutes<00:03:29.930> okay<00:03:30.930> hold<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.500> for<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.160> second<00:03:32.610> or

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
glutes okay hold that for a second or

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.580 
glutes okay hold that for a second or
two<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.150> then<00:03:34.110> come<00:03:34.440> down<00:03:34.970> push<00:03:35.970> your<00:03:36.600> arms

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
two and then come down push your arms

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.880 
two and then come down push your arms
try<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> make<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.550> arms<00:03:38.910> long<00:03:39.330> into<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.650> wall

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
try to make your arms long into the wall

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.040 
try to make your arms long into the wall
so<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.730> see<00:03:42.000> my<00:03:42.150> shoulder<00:03:42.600> blades<00:03:42.810> come

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
so you can see my shoulder blades come

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.310 
so you can see my shoulder blades come
forward<00:03:43.890> or<00:03:44.070> protract<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.840> we're<00:03:46.200> going

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
forward or protract and then we're going

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.460 
forward or protract and then we're going
to<00:03:46.380> reach<00:03:46.530> our<00:03:46.739> hips<00:03:46.920> back<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:48.200> bend<00:03:49.200> our

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
to reach our hips back and bend our

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.180 
to reach our hips back and bend our
ankles<00:03:50.130> up<00:03:50.840> okay

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
ankles up okay

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.190 
ankles up okay
and<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.880> don't<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.240> to<00:03:53.450> lock<00:03:53.750> your<00:03:53.960> knees

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
and you don't have to lock your knees

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.920 
and you don't have to lock your knees
you<00:03:55.190> could<00:03:55.340> keep<00:03:55.490> a<00:03:55.640> little<00:03:55.940> bent<00:03:56.150> if<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.600> want

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
you could keep a little bent if you want

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.530 
you could keep a little bent if you want
if<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.380> too<00:03:57.770> stretchy<00:03:58.760> back<00:03:59.090> here<00:03:59.330> in<00:03:59.450> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
if it's too stretchy back here in the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.160 
if it's too stretchy back here in the
hamstrings<00:04:01.240> but<00:04:02.240> what<00:04:02.420> what<00:04:02.840> tends<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.110> happen

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
hamstrings but what what tends to happen

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.030 
hamstrings but what what tends to happen
is<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.640> muscle<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.390> we're<00:04:05.660> contracting

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
is the muscle that we're contracting

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.640 
is the muscle that we're contracting
opposite<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.820> calves<00:04:08.120> by<00:04:08.900> holding<00:04:09.440> that

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
opposite of the calves by holding that

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.400 
opposite of the calves by holding that
we're<00:04:10.340> sending<00:04:10.610> signals<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.570> calm<00:04:11.960> our<00:04:12.140> calf

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
we're sending signals to calm our calf

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.240 
we're sending signals to calm our calf
muscles<00:04:12.890> down<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.310> also<00:04:14.530> commonly<00:04:15.530> this

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
muscles down and also commonly this

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.670 
muscles down and also commonly this
tibialis<00:04:16.790> interior<00:04:17.540> these<00:04:17.750> muscles<00:04:18.530> in<00:04:18.590> the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
tibialis interior these muscles in the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.860 
tibialis interior these muscles in the
front<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.070> shin<00:04:19.310> tend<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.180> get<00:04:20.299> weak<00:04:20.540> so

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
front of the shin tend to get weak so

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.770 
front of the shin tend to get weak so
it's<00:04:21.170> sort<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.440> encouraging<00:04:22.340> those<00:04:23.300> muscles

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
it's sort of encouraging those muscles

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.610 
it's sort of encouraging those muscles
be<00:04:24.110> stimulated<00:04:24.740> okay<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:25.760> here<00:04:26.150> we<00:04:26.240> go<00:04:26.620> then

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
be stimulated okay so here we go then

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.720 
be stimulated okay so here we go then
come<00:04:27.830> up<00:04:27.920> onto<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> balls<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.700> feet

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
come up onto the balls of the feet

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.270 
come up onto the balls of the feet
squeeze<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.780> knees<00:04:29.960> straight<00:04:30.320> squeeze<00:04:30.950> our

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
squeeze that knees straight squeeze our

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.570 
squeeze that knees straight squeeze our
glutes<00:04:32.260> okay<00:04:33.260> we<00:04:33.410> all<00:04:33.530> know<00:04:33.740> that<00:04:33.950> can<00:04:34.130> easily

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
glutes okay we all know that can easily

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.430 
glutes okay we all know that can easily
get<00:04:34.760> weak<00:04:35.000> by<00:04:35.210> sitting<00:04:35.540> a<00:04:35.600> lot<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.990> then<00:04:36.320> we're

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
get weak by sitting a lot and then we're

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.530 
get weak by sitting a lot and then we're
going<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.590> push<00:04:37.070> against<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.580> wall<00:04:37.610> reach<00:04:38.360> our

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
going to push against the wall reach our

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:46.170 
going to push against the wall reach our
hips<00:04:38.780> back<00:04:39.140> bend<00:04:40.010> or<00:04:40.160> ankles<00:04:40.580> up

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.970 

so<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.840> can<00:04:47.020> play<00:04:47.200> around<00:04:47.320> with<00:04:47.560> this<00:04:47.740> and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
so you can play around with this and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.040 
so you can play around with this and
adjust<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:49.180> level<00:04:49.390> of<00:04:49.540> challenge<00:04:49.780> that

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
adjust for the level of challenge that

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.820 
adjust for the level of challenge that
you<00:04:50.290> want<00:04:50.530> if<00:04:51.100> you're<00:04:51.310> close<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.180> wall

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
you want if you're close to the wall

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.790 
you want if you're close to the wall
hands<00:04:53.830> about<00:04:54.100> shoulder-width<00:04:54.700> you<00:04:55.570> can<00:04:56.020> get<00:04:56.770> a

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
hands about shoulder-width you can get a

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.110 
hands about shoulder-width you can get a
good<00:04:57.570> contraction<00:04:58.830> when<00:04:59.830> you<00:05:00.010> come<00:05:00.310> back<00:05:00.850> you

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
good contraction when you come back you

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.290 
good contraction when you come back you
may<00:05:01.390> be<00:05:01.450> able<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.870> lift<00:05:02.410> your<00:05:03.160> toes<00:05:03.550> up<00:05:03.580> off<00:05:04.090> the

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
may be able to lift your toes up off the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.700 
may be able to lift your toes up off the
ground<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.780> little<00:05:04.900> bit<00:05:05.080> more<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.560> have<00:05:05.680> a

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
ground a little bit more so you have a

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.670 
ground a little bit more so you have a
stronger<00:05:06.160> contraction<00:05:06.400> here<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:08.260> could<00:05:08.440> also

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
stronger contraction here you could also

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.010 
stronger contraction here you could also
come<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> little<00:05:09.520> bit<00:05:09.610> further<00:05:10.060> from<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.780> wall

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
come a little bit further from the wall

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.020 
come a little bit further from the wall
and<00:05:11.680> you'll<00:05:11.800> have<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.070> move<00:05:12.250> your<00:05:12.370> hands<00:05:12.820> down

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
and you'll have to move your hands down

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.320 
and you'll have to move your hands down
til<00:05:13.330> they're<00:05:13.450> about<00:05:13.570> shoulder<00:05:13.990> height<00:05:14.260> and

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
til they're about shoulder height and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.840 
til they're about shoulder height and
here<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:17.200> going<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.530> be<00:05:18.000> tougher<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.570> come
