00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello to all friends if gabriel or 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.130
 who as you prefer and today 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.750
 so we end up for the presentation 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.570
 of a minecraft mode so the real of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.820
 kempf ayew so what does this mode do in 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.950
 does that go add two types two fires 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.810
 of camp who so donated serve 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.150
 is to cook the food or be 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.469
 just decorated so the first kraft to 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.140
 know my for this mode 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.690
 so this is firstly the craft so 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.900
 for the oven which finally the fire bridge 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.350
 who will be used to cook food 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.390
 so it takes 3 koebel 3 stick in that seen 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.329
 a charming center by mountains and not 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.690
 actually it's going to give that so how's that 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.390
 market 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.739
 so be exactly the same 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.070
 interface in fact that the oven 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.380
 so we put fuel here and put 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.820
 the food has pushed back so the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.800
 difference is that in two places 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.360
 to cook at the same time but 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.080
 the other difference is that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.970
 within cloud from leather minerals 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.040
 so as you see if I put by 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.570
 example a gold ore that's wrong 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 operate it works only for 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 cook food so with this 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.750
 campfire can also cook 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.159
 the food with a lighter so if 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.319
 we place another 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.149
 food in the respective places on 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.810
 can use the lighter to turn on the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.009
 fire and it's going to cook our food 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.869
 Then the second campfire 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.840
 added by this mode in fact this is the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.159
 king fayot so always active so the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.500
 difference for the just crafter on 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.450
 replace the coal with a lighter and that 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.179
 is going to give his is actually this one can 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.709
 not interact with and it's always 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.179
 active so it's just to decorate on 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.280
 can place it for example in a living room 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.459
 or in a forest it can do the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.829
 light and it can interact with and the 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.840
 fire is never going it's a next 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.280
 last kraft of those in this mode actually 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.929
 it's going to be the dogs back pain in 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.229
 place two sugars aside that gave me a 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.899
 malawi match that can be cooked 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.619
 so with the campfire like this 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.129
 we are going to place here we will reload 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.129
 our oven 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.420
 we will see what it gives 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.490
 it gives all the things where you can 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.760
 can a little puff to recover from the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.530
 end so that's all for this little 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.060
 minecraft mode that will add something 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.400
 nice enough it's very very simple but 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 I think it's pretty funny and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.670
 it gives that adds a little facilities 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.840
 to cook his food once 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.000
 that we lost for example in the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.250
 forest one can be and cook one's 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.690
 shower with campfires so that's 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.360
 enough rp I like I think that 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.860
 it's very cool so here's thanks for having 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.820
 watched this video and we meet again 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.820
 next time go
