00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
level I knew there had to be one because

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.930 
level I knew there had to be one because
there<00:02:37.079> was<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.100> original<00:02:38.280> game<00:02:38.760> at

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
there was one in the original game at

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.720 
there was one in the original game at
the<00:02:39.180> very<00:02:39.420> same<00:02:39.750> place<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.769> after<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> spent

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the very same place but after I spent

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.300 
the very same place but after I spent
more<00:02:42.060> than<00:02:42.329> half<00:02:42.600> an<00:02:42.720> hour<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.470> stage<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
more than half an hour on this stage the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.069 
more than half an hour on this stage the
elusive<00:02:44.700> secret<00:02:45.000> exit<00:02:45.359> seemed<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.959> be

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
elusive secret exit seemed to be

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.069 
elusive secret exit seemed to be
non-existent<00:02:46.970> after<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> eventually<00:02:48.450> found<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
non-existent after I eventually found it

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.360 
non-existent after I eventually found it
near<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.380> end<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.890> level<00:02:50.100> by

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
near the end of the level by

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.150 
near the end of the level by
ground-pounding<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.299> felt<00:02:51.930> completely<00:02:52.590> dumb

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
ground-pounding I felt completely dumb

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.910 
ground-pounding I felt completely dumb
for<00:02:53.640> wasting<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.299> much<00:02:54.329> precious<00:02:55.049> time<00:02:55.319> on<00:02:55.530> one

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
for wasting so much precious time on one

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.069 
for wasting so much precious time on one
of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.190> earliest<00:02:56.819> stages<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.600> game<00:02:57.630> and

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
of the earliest stages of the game and

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.990 
of the earliest stages of the game and
that<00:02:58.109> was<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.549> beginning

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that was just the beginning

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.390 
that was just the beginning
the<00:03:00.600> real<00:03:00.810> challenges<00:03:01.440> were<00:03:01.769> yet<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.220> be

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the real challenges were yet to be

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.750 
the real challenges were yet to be
revealed<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.940> me

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.030 

Oh<00:03:07.980> eat<00:03:08.980> me

sixth level of superstar mode which is
kind<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.830> self-explanatory<00:05:37.360> because<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.570> is

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
kind of self-explanatory because it is

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.159 
kind of self-explanatory because it is
one<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.260> last<00:05:39.440> stages<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:40.100> the<00:05:40.190> game

this<00:05:59.120> stage<00:05:59.389> trying<00:05:59.930> several<00:06:00.440> strategies<00:06:00.710> to

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
this stage trying several strategies to

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.520 
this stage trying several strategies to
survive<00:06:01.280> this<00:06:01.699> fire<00:06:01.940> madness<00:06:02.419> but<00:06:03.020> soon<00:06:03.290> I

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
survive this fire madness but soon I

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.560 
survive this fire madness but soon I
realized<00:06:04.250> that<00:06:04.639> I<00:06:04.699> had<00:06:04.970> to<00:06:05.000> sprint<00:06:05.419> without

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
realized that I had to sprint without

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.750 
realized that I had to sprint without
stopping<00:06:06.260> even<00:06:06.800> for<00:06:07.070> a<00:06:07.100> second

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
stopping even for a second

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.240 
stopping even for a second
the<00:06:08.240> catch<00:06:08.479> is<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:09.050> start<00:06:09.350> at<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.680> right<00:06:09.889> time

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
the catch is to start at the right time

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:33.779 
the catch is to start at the right time
but<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:11.150> will<00:06:11.449> take<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:11.780> while<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.110> get<00:06:12.470> it<00:06:12.590> right
