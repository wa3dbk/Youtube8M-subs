veil<00:00:36.879> is<00:00:37.210> your<00:00:37.510> basic<00:00:37.930> moves<00:00:38.199> over<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.710> you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
veil is your basic moves over the you

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.760 
veil is your basic moves over the you
know<00:00:39.070> how<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.400> do<00:00:39.610> with<00:00:39.879> regular<00:00:40.330> one<00:00:40.870> veil

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770

know how to do with regular one veil
the<00:00:42.010> only<00:00:42.219> difference<00:00:42.670> is<00:00:42.760> going<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:43.090> be<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
the only difference is going to be the

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.630 
the only difference is going to be the
amount<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.350> weight<00:00:44.590> you're<00:00:44.829> holding

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
amount of weight you're holding

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.119 
amount of weight you're holding
so<00:00:45.790> there's<00:00:46.000> double<00:00:46.480> weight<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.260> obviously

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
so there's double weight and obviously

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.160 
so there's double weight and obviously
the<00:00:48.579> finger<00:00:48.910> placement<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.870> know<00:00:49.989> which

the finger placement you know which

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.420 
the finger placement you know which
makes<00:00:50.379> sure<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.710> cannot<00:00:50.950> want<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.250> move

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
makes sure that I cannot want to move

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.700 
makes sure that I cannot want to move
too<00:00:51.670> much<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:52.480> fingers<00:00:52.870> because<00:00:53.289> you<00:00:53.469> might

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
too much the fingers because you might

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.950

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
lose worth it okay but with the one bit

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.540 
lose worth it okay but with the one bit
with<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.260> double<00:00:56.559> value<00:00:56.680> can<00:00:56.980> do<00:00:57.070> exactly<00:00:57.430> the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.380 

none<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.100> these<00:01:54.280> moves<00:01:54.520> by<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.759> way<00:01:54.970> are<00:01:55.149> new

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the toggle fail just like you did with

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.389 
the toggle fail just like you did with
the<00:02:08.019> one<00:02:08.229> valve<00:02:08.470> there's<00:02:08.739> absolutely<00:02:09.220> no

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
the one valve there's absolutely no

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.949 
the one valve there's absolutely no
difference<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.209> only<00:02:10.239> difference<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
difference the only difference that the

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.210 
difference the only difference that the
said<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.230> you're<00:02:11.380> gonna<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.860> get<00:02:11.980> used<00:02:12.130> to

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
said is you're gonna have to get used to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.190 
said is you're gonna have to get used to
the<00:02:12.340> amount<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.970> weight<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.750> don't<00:02:13.840> hold<00:02:14.049> it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the amount of weight you don't hold it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.750 
the amount of weight you don't hold it
which<00:02:14.590> puts<00:02:14.829> a<00:02:14.950> little<00:02:15.130> bit<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.400> pressure<00:02:15.579> on

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
which puts a little bit of pressure on

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.979 
which puts a little bit of pressure on
the<00:02:15.880> shoulder<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.420> also<00:02:16.569> makes<00:02:16.870> a

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
the shoulder and it also makes a

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:17.400 
the shoulder and it also makes a
difference

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
difference

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.050 
difference
how<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> control<00:02:17.920> your<00:02:17.980> veil<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.760> very

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
how you control your veil it's very

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.200 
how you control your veil it's very
important<00:02:19.570> as<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.750> said<00:02:19.900> before<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.800> use

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
important as I said before not to use

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.600 
important as I said before not to use
some<00:02:22.210> veils<00:02:22.480> because<00:02:23.050> they<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.310> move<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.460> their

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
some veils because they do move on their

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.070 
some veils because they do move on their
own<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.210> have<00:02:25.240> kind<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.780> lighter

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
own and they have kind of a lighter

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.770 
own and they have kind of a lighter
weight<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.150> want<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.300> be<00:02:28.450> able<00:02:28.570> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
weight and you want to be able to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600 
weight and you want to be able to
control<00:02:29.260> your<00:02:29.530> veils<00:02:29.800> when<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> double

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
control your veils when you do a double

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.150 
control your veils when you do a double

they're all teaching you how to do
different<00:02:53.530> available<00:02:53.980> movements<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.880> take

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
different available movements so take

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.880 
different available movements so take
those<00:02:55.240> same<00:02:55.450> exact<00:02:55.870> movements<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.620> would

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
those same exact movements and you would

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.290 
those same exact movements and you would
want<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.250> go<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.490> then<00:02:57.610> do<00:02:57.760> them<00:02:57.850> with<00:02:58.000> double

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
want a go and then do them with double

want a go and then do them with double
veil<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.690> then<00:02:59.020> get<00:02:59.200> used<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.770> first<00:03:00.040> and

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
veil and then get used to it first and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.070 
veil and then get used to it first and
then<00:03:00.460> we'll<00:03:00.640> move<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.940> from<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.870> other

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
then we'll move on from there to other

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.530 
then we'll move on from there to other
movements<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:02.890> are<00:03:02.950> actually<00:03:03.310> unique<00:03:03.550> to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
movements that are actually unique to
