on<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> video<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> game<00:00:38.969> on

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
on in the video but this was a game on

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.020 
on in the video but this was a game on
mercy<00:00:39.719> probably<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.640> second<00:00:41.640> least<00:00:41.879> favorite

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
mercy probably my second least favorite

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.130 
mercy probably my second least favorite
map<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.719> Gears<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.989> War<00:00:43.110> 3<00:00:43.230> um<00:00:43.969> my<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.390> least

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
map in Gears of War 3 um my first least

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
map in Gears of War 3 um my first least
favorite<00:00:46.739> map<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> don't

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
favorite map how are the one I don't

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.290 
favorite map how are the one I don't
like<00:00:48.360> them<00:00:48.570> though<00:00:48.750> she's<00:00:49.079> probably<00:00:50.300> overpass

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
like them though she's probably overpass

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
like them though she's probably overpass
I<00:00:51.629> don't<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.410> map<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.860> much<00:00:53.070> um

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I don't really like that map so much um

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.020 
I don't really like that map so much um
but<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.930> problem<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.039> map<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.789> if

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
but the problem with this map is that if

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.569 
but the problem with this map is that if
you<00:00:57.539> control<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.530> church<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.160> pretty<00:00:59.489> much

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you control the church you pretty much

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.740 
you control the church you pretty much
control<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> entire<00:01:00.859> map<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.510> got

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
control the entire map because it's got

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.270 
control the entire map because it's got
all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> power<00:01:04.290> weapons<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.129> got

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
all the power weapons you know it's got

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
all the power weapons you know it's got
bigger<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> boom<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.740> know

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
bigger and boom it's got you know

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
bigger and boom it's got you know
grenades<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.520> outside<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.750> pretty

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
grenades right outside it you can pretty

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
grenades right outside it you can pretty
much<00:01:09.990> camp<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.250> only<00:01:11.610> defense

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
much camp in there the only defense

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
much camp in there the only defense
against<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.590> mortar<00:01:14.130> that's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
against it really is the mortar that's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.330 
against it really is the mortar that's
the<00:01:14.460> only<00:01:14.729> good<00:01:15.320> weapon<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.439> spawns<00:01:16.830> outside

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the only good weapon that spawns outside

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.749 
the only good weapon that spawns outside
of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> church<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.409> its<00:01:19.409> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.250> covered<00:01:20.640> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of the church and its kind of covered in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
of the church and its kind of covered in
there<00:01:20.909> there's<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> spots<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.170> we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
there there's a lot of spots in there we

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010 
there there's a lot of spots in there we
can<00:01:22.909> stand<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> won't<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.689> hit<00:01:24.869> with

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
can stand that you won't get hit with

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
can stand that you won't get hit with
the<00:01:25.140> mortar<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.490> he<00:01:26.580> should

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the mortar so I think that he should

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
the mortar so I think that he should
switch<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> weapons<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.200> there

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
switch up the weapons a little bit there

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
switch up the weapons a little bit there
but<00:01:28.590> other<00:01:28.770> than<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.009> um<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.549> don't<00:01:29.610> mind<00:01:29.850> us

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
but other than that um I don't mind us

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060 
but other than that um I don't mind us
map<00:01:30.240> too<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.079> wish<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
map too much I wish there was like a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
map too much I wish there was like a
sniper<00:01:32.400> our<00:01:32.729> torque<00:01:33.030> bow<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.630> something

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
sniper our torque bow on it or something

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
sniper our torque bow on it or something
like<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.850> realize<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.030> can't<00:01:36.240> have

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
like that but I realize you can't have

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.500 
like that but I realize you can't have
those<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.930> every<00:01:37.290> single

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
those on every single

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.050 
those on every single
you<00:01:38.600> know<00:01:38.720> every<00:01:39.110> single<00:01:39.260> map<00:01:39.620> but<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.400> just

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
you know every single map but I I just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.210 
you know every single map but I I just
actually<00:01:41.330> got<00:01:41.630> finished<00:01:42.230> seeing<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.740> very

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
actually got finished seeing a very

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.900 
actually got finished seeing a very
interesting<00:01:44.150> video<00:01:44.710> if<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:46.130> remember<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.670> I

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910

will<00:01:47.270> put<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.170> description<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:49.760> was

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
will put it in the description it was

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.700

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.979 
I thought it was cool because they
actually<00:02:52.130> tested<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.970> over<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.450> over<00:02:53.600> and

actually tested it over and over and
outside<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> melee<00:02:55.100> range<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:56.110> parting<00:02:57.110> shot
