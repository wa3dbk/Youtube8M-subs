 a good tribute to action movies 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.960
 Asian so we could define sleeping

 third installment after a long period of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 development and everything seemed that the first 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.250
 delivery that was going to make the leap to this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.469
 generation would die in the attempt until 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 that square enix bought the game and everything 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.940
 what has been developed to date 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.980
 united front games internal studios 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 square enix is the one who has taken care of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.060
 modify enhance and finish this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.130
 production changing the protagonist 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.860
 varying the history and the name of the 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.140
 ip is ping docs is a sandbox 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.579
 conventional that offers us a huge 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.079
 game space in which we are 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.500
 present major missions and 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.780
 secondary a lot of action and driving is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 the proposal shows openly all 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.000
 your sources of inspiration that go through 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.950
 gta 4 yakuza 4 without strauss say 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 the two recent installments of the batman of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.380
 rocksteady a max payne series between 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.510
 others 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.190
 It takes many of its elements to 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.050
 offer an adventure in which highlights 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.960
 especially the hand-to-hand fighting 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.180
 using enhanced martial arts 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.850
 mainly by its protagonist 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.470
 wayne be a policeman who should 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.950
 face in the triads to finish 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.390
 with the Chinese mafia from 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.430
 the situations that we will live 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.560
 controlling who will immerse us in a 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.079
 well deep and long hatched adventure 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.119
 with script twists and replete with 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.789
 interesting characters with whom 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.469
 we will have to play a double role all 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.319
 it while we move by a hong 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.149
 kong credible and recognizable but adapted 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.159
 yes to the characteristics of the game 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.490
 so much for the moments of action on foot 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.409
 as controlling vehicles and is that this 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.569
 capital offers us a great amalgam of 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.819
 locations that united front games has 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.039
 known to take to place missions 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.870
 of all kinds keeping that feeling 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.819
 of constant danger that evokes the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.620
 city ​​under that umbrella of colors 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.380
 striking that adorn many of their 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.030
 streets we will get used to the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.310
 low funds to deal with the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.950
 mobsters to persuade and use the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.340
 violence has been fought or with weapons of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.590
 fire 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.079
 the duration of the game and the story 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.060
 raised do that during the first 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.829
 hours of play still go away 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.360
 presenting tutorials that are going 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.099
 explaining the basic movements of 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.079
 fight how our 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.060
 character driving the vehicles 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.069
 the acquisition of free floors etc 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.170
 Needless to say, the player habit of 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.880
 the sandboxes will not see how they unfold 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.830
 the first trees of missions to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.380
 choose until we are well 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.270
 entered into the game in fact the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.739
 Weapon tutorial does not appear until 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.040
 after 5 hours of missions 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.989
 main 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.969
 the main missions are worth the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.890
 redundancy are always varied and 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.230
 It will be usual to start on foot and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.659
 end up in a chase and vice versa 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.060
 but never fall into the monotony or the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.010
 repetition of outline the great variety 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.959
 of proposals falls on the secondary 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.790
 where in addition to using weapons and 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.010
 vehicles for example we have to 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.069
 solve puzzles or collect certain 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.590
 objects we are facing a game that is going 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.959
 To cost squeeze thanks to the quantity 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.250
 of missions that we have ahead if 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.019
 it is true that we can explore the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.239
 main missions in less than 15 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.280
 hours also meet the secondary ones to 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.159
 one hundred percent can mean us more 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.139
 of 100 hours of play that does not count the 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.950
 free celestial that will be added 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:44.799
 and they generate lengthening more and more there's 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.480
 multiplayer option as such something nothing 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.310
 usual in current games and that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.919
 for many it can mean a point 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.689
 negative for this guy the only thing that 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.410
 shares are the results of our 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.000
 missions and names 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.190
 the set of what it offers us 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.770
 sleeping dogs is very big but also 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.450
 quality is the elaborate story that 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.240
 we are told is reinforced by a 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.430
 Direct and intuitive gameplay in which 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.800
 Bast is distributed everywhere with 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.810
 logical combinations of buttons very 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.510
 similar to the arkham batman system 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.790
 asylum and arkham city 'the presentation of 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.680
 the fights are fluid as the rest 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.750
 of the game offering as really 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.400
 spectacular and the possibility of 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.500
 interact also with many parts 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.470
 of the environment that the voices report 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.420
 more spectacular consell also 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.040
 we will fire piecework and 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.830
 we will carry out persecutions to all 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.710
 speed can also jump from a 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.020
 vehicle to another it is possible to slow down the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.450
 action at or max payne aspect that has been 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.860
 maintained from the first truck crime 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.720
 there is also quick time events 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.169
 spectacular at certain times 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.330
 punctual 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.430
 at the end of missions or when performing 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.409
 the unique feats are reported to us the 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.289
 relevant triad score or 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.729
 police unfortunately in this aspect 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.949
 it is not as elaborate as it would be 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.990
 wait and it stopped evolving a lot the 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.749
 character powers only some of his 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.310
 fourth aspects perform more or less 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.990
 secondary missions will not make us 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.020
 evolve very differently 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.029
 is born but it will reward us 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 long with a greater variety of weapons and 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:16.770
 vehicles driving moments 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.599
 arcade are fast and showy with 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.719
 physical that although somewhat exaggerated 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.370
 they are credible in the good game 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.960
 feeling of speed crowd of 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.939
 elements of the environment that are destroyed 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.310
 pleasure and vehicles that show damage 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.710
 especially when ramming laterally 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.219
 against each other something that has 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.539
 remembered the game wilman de vin diesel 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.610
 visually the game offers a great 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.800
 finished with a special dedication the 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.539
 characters and their animations first and 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.040
 in the city after the other 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.780
 protagonist of the game 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.340
 it certainly does not become so 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.620
 spectacular in this aspect as what 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.110
 can gta 4 but certainly offers a 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.760
 solid aspect sprinkled only from some 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.710
 popping punctual and of some vehicles 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.080
 that could have been better 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.090
 representable the sonorous aspect 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.730
 highlight the interpretations of 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.860
 dubbing in English but it's something fair with 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.180
 regarding themes and sound effects with 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.160
 vehicles that even if they behave 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.530
 saying way they look alike for their 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.770
 sound as well as different weapons that 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.300
 they produce the same noise of shots 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.760
 sleeping dogs is situated in quality and 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.860
 offer between gta 4 and saint row say 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.930
 but he knows how to do without the touches 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.140
 horny that presents one and another 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.390
 reference especially the one of th q for 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.970
 offer us a more serious proposal about 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.680
 everything in its main missions since 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.240
 we talk about comparing indicate that also 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.470
 we will customize the character with 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.930
 different clothes that we will be getting 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.390
 and we will use the phone to get 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.530
 missions concluding we'll say it's from 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.480
 ping docs that is a long game 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.360
 spectacular fun and well finished 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.380
 although it may be easy for 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.380
 the usual ones to the genre
