just kind of got used to eyeballing all

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.020 
just kind of got used to eyeballing all
the<00:04:41.070> ingredients<00:04:41.580> because<00:04:41.699> I've<00:04:41.910> been

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the ingredients because I've been

cooking for a while so I kind of know

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.460 
cooking for a while so I kind of know
just<00:04:44.699> by<00:04:44.820> looking<00:04:44.850> if<00:04:45.600> something<00:04:46.199> will<00:04:46.350> be

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470
