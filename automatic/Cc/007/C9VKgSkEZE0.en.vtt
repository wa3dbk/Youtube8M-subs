00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.780
 not use the side of the body as 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.870
 support to be the same always 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:38.690
 unitarily by checking the conditions 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.179

 cracks or hit marks 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.040
 the carton can not be hit or 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.830
 uneven flooring or 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.560
 dragged from side to side during the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.710
 handling at the installation or the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710
 construction 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 the lifting of boxes with the capacity to 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.510
 from five thousand liters should be 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.120
 made with crane or a kit with long arm 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.670
 and conversion into nylon straps or strips 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.060
 never will be box by the loops look 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.550
 anchor avoiding beats in the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.369
 walls of the box on the right foot of the base 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.770
 due to an event during the lifting of the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.660
 same when bases are targeted 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 buildings and towers 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.570
 the base must be built in concrete 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.119
 armed with steel and drugs and must be 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950
 according to study of the soil as we ask 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.070
 in the installation manual 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.650
 the company that will perform the service 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.920
 give assurance to your customer 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.460
 the base must be strictly at the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 be 10% greater than the diameter of the bottom of the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.880
 box and have fruit centimeters in height 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 to avoid problems with rainwater 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.920
 check if there are no stones 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.650
 screws generally lie between the base 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.050
 and bottom of the carton as they can damage 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.769
 when filled due to the weight 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.890
 anterior to the box at the base by the looks 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.680
 to steel giants in this heat 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.620
 the cover of the carton should be placed and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.420
 properly screwed in before starting 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.910
 the water intake for use 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.670
 this procedure is necessary for the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.850
 balance and prevention of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.850
 dengue 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.350
 it is forbidden to bury the whole box or 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.590
 partially 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.170
 drilling is prohibited on the wall of the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.190
 outside the places indicated by the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.069
 manufacturer 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.560
 relations must be at least 50 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.230
 centimeters away from each other 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.360
 donations should be made only in 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.510
 predetermined places by the manufacturer 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.840
 the aid of video or hole saw 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.450
 starting with a maximum of two inches and 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.450
 with flash and hard pvc population 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.080
 the piping must be fully supported 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.140
 and anchored with clamps and can not 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.510
 thus leaving gold on the flagstones is 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.750
 interconnect the boxes with 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.880
 population between them 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.010
 in case of boxes in sequence do 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.530
 connection through belly milk to 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 bring the water from the boxes to the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 without interconnection between them 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:09.630
 Box must have thief and entry entry 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.820
 output always with the same gauge at 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.640
 box designed for the output and input 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.510
 water and gravitational process 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:24.000
 without bombs never close these boats 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.670
 the carton should be installed on a base 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.630
 without gaps or voids with 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:34.650
 smooth and level surface without 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.760
 streak of wood or products 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.660
 ceramics 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.430
 but I see between the bottom of the box and the 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.620
 reinforced concrete base 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.169
 installation must be carried out by a 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.930
 dance customer trust company 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.600
 responsible for non- compliance with 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.880
 this information will be decisive 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 for loss of factory warranty of the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.090
 Cashier 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.070
