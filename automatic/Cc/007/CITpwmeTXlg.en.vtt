00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.089 
here wall right there and right there
build<00:02:55.269> these<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:57.299> build<00:02:58.299> this<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.799> no<00:02:59.799> not

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
build these up I build this up no not

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.250 
build these up I build this up no not
like<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:02.159> do<00:03:03.159> it<00:03:03.189> like<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
like that do it like that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.179 
like that do it like that
break<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.439> hole<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.829> middle<00:03:06.069> put<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
break the hole in the middle put the

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.309 
break the hole in the middle put the
pressure<00:03:09.189> plate<00:03:09.489> down<00:03:09.700> right<00:03:09.939> there<00:03:10.319> where

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
pressure plate down right there where

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.229 
pressure plate down right there where
that<00:03:11.969> bottom<00:03:12.969> floor<00:03:13.359> is<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:14.159> then<00:03:15.159> you<00:03:16.000> can

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
that bottom floor is and then you can

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.309 
that bottom floor is and then you can
put<00:03:17.849> creepers<00:03:18.849> in<00:03:19.180> there<00:03:19.599> however<00:03:19.870> many<00:03:20.230> you

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
put creepers in there however many you

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.349 
put creepers in there however many you
want<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.650> doesn't<00:03:20.799> matter<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:21.969> you<00:03:22.180> can

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
want it doesn't matter and then you can

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.619 
want it doesn't matter and then you can
close<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.230> off<00:03:23.439> okay<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.219> then<00:03:24.940> find<00:03:25.479> the

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
close that off okay and then find the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.750 
close that off okay and then find the
center<00:03:25.989> that's<00:03:26.590> where<00:03:26.799> your<00:03:27.099> pressure<00:03:27.430> plate

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
center that's where your pressure plate

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.879 
center that's where your pressure plate
is<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.299> then<00:03:29.199> lead<00:03:29.739> this<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.379> Redstone

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
is and then lead this to the Redstone

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.159 
is and then lead this to the Redstone
right<00:03:33.040> here<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.639> you're<00:03:33.879> done<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.900> it

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
right here and you're done that is it

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.020 
right here and you're done that is it
that<00:03:35.799> is<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.699> so<00:03:37.799> whenever<00:03:38.799> your<00:03:39.519> players

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
that is it and so whenever your players

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.210 
that is it and so whenever your players
or<00:03:40.329> whatever<00:03:40.629> are<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.439> peaceful<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.159> then

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
or whatever are on peaceful and then

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.159 
or whatever are on peaceful and then
they<00:03:42.400> try<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.699> push<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.419> won't<00:03:43.930> do

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
they try and push it it won't do

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.929 
they try and push it it won't do
anything<00:03:44.409> because<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.220> spawn<00:03:45.489> egg<00:03:45.699> won't

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
anything because the spawn egg won't

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.729 
anything because the spawn egg won't
spawn<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.329> creeper<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.049> then<00:03:47.199> it<00:03:47.319> won't<00:03:47.439> step

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
spawn a creeper and then it won't step

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.619 
spawn a creeper and then it won't step
on<00:03:47.859> the<00:03:48.010> pressure<00:03:48.220> plate<00:03:48.359> which<00:03:49.359> won't

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
on the pressure plate which won't

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.289 
on the pressure plate which won't
activate<00:03:50.079> closing<00:03:50.949> these<00:03:51.129> Pistons<00:03:51.669> but<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.150> it

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
activate closing these Pistons but if it

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.229 
activate closing these Pistons but if it
is<00:03:52.449> uneasy<00:03:52.900> or<00:03:53.549> normal<00:03:54.549> or<00:03:54.669> hard<00:03:54.939> or<00:03:55.060> whatever

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
is uneasy or normal or hard or whatever

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.640 
is uneasy or normal or hard or whatever
and<00:03:55.599> then<00:03:55.689> they<00:03:55.720> press<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.139> button<00:03:56.439> the

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
and then they press the button the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.559 
and then they press the button the
creeper<00:03:56.949> will<00:03:57.129> spawn<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.639> it<00:03:57.939> will<00:03:58.060> step<00:03:58.329> on

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
creeper will spawn and it will step on

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.490 
creeper will spawn and it will step on
the<00:03:58.629> pressure<00:03:59.590> plate<00:03:59.859> that<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.549> put<00:04:00.849> in<00:04:00.970> there

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the pressure plate that I put in there

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.249 
the pressure plate that I put in there
very<00:04:02.500> simple<00:04:02.979> idea<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.849> haven't<00:04:04.750> seen<00:04:04.959> anybody

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:05.259
