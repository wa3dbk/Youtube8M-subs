00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.039

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.510
 lining 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.670
 I learned there to watch Carlos Felipe and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.580
 so for me it's a genre that I can go 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.450
 for rhythmic musical matches 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.800
 better than it is more so you have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.540
 drag a foot that's more or less like this 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.050
 you can sing 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.100

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.670
 Look at the dog that was yesterday with whom. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.250
 she is born will arise 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.399
 look I think walk talk which is famous 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.870
 This is but it 's a boys thing and in the south 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.530
 until they do not use much what I 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.390
 I think dance is faster then I go 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.270
 call gives you this guarantee but it is not 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:22.420
 this family that the mall offers is 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:34.409
 you can even look the bitch Obina penalty 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:37.350
 or not to sin is the only rule is joe 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.979
 appear 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.229
 which is young but they already do here 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:48.799
 August staff and then it was the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.799
 traditional forrÃ³ that you can isolate 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.390
 no, no 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 out 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.209
 I'm going to walk there and say that there are people 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 shows the side of the instrumental accordion 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.970
 Inca also for shows will explain the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 things and have a taste that you can 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.810
 walk 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.230
 ae 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:47.470
 years and it happens to the society that 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.540
 parents to educate musically 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.489
 This has a job, this is a step in the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.530
 important work on products can 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.590
 do it with the kids and today I think 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.440
 that the range of youth thus 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.510
 knowledge with access to these things 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.700
 they have become very easy I believe it is 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.340
 cousin brother, the young man wants to know 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.190
 host games also college study 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.190
 out and such but I do not think it covers 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.950
 much like today is the art of music 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.829
 Music chooses people so today I 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.700
 I'm satisfied with the music and formal 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:32.980
 For me it's as a witness and the music is 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:35.950
 I speak here or call 1 but the vote is 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:44.349
 Who rules little of my top 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:47.370
 I want to suffer from poor application was 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.400
 to the window and appeared 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.400
 is 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.450
 also says that what I need is that 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.450
