00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.300
 hello guys and girls very good at all 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.570
 welcome to a video more as you see a 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.760
 new game battlefield 3 to change 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.920
 a bit the dynamics of the channel and that 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 be all call of duty because with the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 series that I'm carrying out with nike 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.949
 Well, maybe I am 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 focusing a little more on call of duty and 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.599
 fifa 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.230
 with the rock series your elche that tomorrow 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.149
 We will have a new good episode will 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.840
 use this gameplay not only for 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.510
 comment it but also to analyze a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.010
 little the new medal of honor war 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.719
 warfighter sorry 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.010
 and how are we going to analyze it if it's a 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.070
 toilet gameplay filtres good then 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 let's compare them because when I've 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.200
 viewed 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 gameplay of 'medal of honor' first thing 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.520
 that has come to my head is that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.550
 they are very similar and then 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.980
 right now you are going to see the screen 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.840
 rival left battlefield 3 and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.939
 low to the right 'medal of honor' 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.289
 maybe so small is not appreciated 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.750
 enough but to see is the same engine 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.259
 graphic so you see that maybe 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.940
 the movements and the graphics are 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.330
 practically the same 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.590
 yes it is true that battlefield 3 has 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.020
 a more futuristic roll the menus are more 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.410
 with more vivid colors however in 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.720
 'medal of honor' the menus and what they are 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.400
 the maps are gray and 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.650
 brown colors earth 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.530
 yes it is true that 'medal of honor' is a 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.200
 little gets you maybe a little more in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.160
 the war for ya I tell you for the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.110
 graphics a little more muted colors 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.540
 but that they are no longer the muted colors 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.500
 they have modern warfare 3 who are 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.500
 grayish tones 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.590
 with hardly any color because this to see that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.980
 you are in the field, it is normal for everything to be 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.790
 earth color in brown tones 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.650
 so I do not see any 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.460
 inconvenient in any complaint the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.270
 graphics of 'medal of honor' war fighter 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.240
 the gameplay is from a guiri vale 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.410
 Well, I do not know about when 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.640
 beta will go out for playstation3 I suppose 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.790
 that will be released on Wednesday 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.379
 store update 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.079
 and well, yes, it is true that I 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.260
 I see very similar ones as far as 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.970
 movements and such I have not played love 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.930
 forgive 'medal of honor' but 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.050
 apparently they are very similar 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.810
 the weapons are also 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.550
 very very equal to the looks I think 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.910
 that if they are not the same they are very 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.370
 similar in this case the gameplay of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.110
 'medal of honor' takes a look at 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.850
 specialty the red dot and here then 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.910
 we are using the sniper 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.840
 and nothing because I tell you if you see 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.850
 if we compare the gameplays one that is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.060
 the battlefield 3 will be the colors 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.390
 more intense more vivid the blue of the sky 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.610
 it's not the same blue as the 'medal of 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.490
 honor ' elena the reason is that it is a bit 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.480
 more pulling to grayish white than in 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.690
 blue 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.299
 but I 'm judging from this map that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.750
 I'm seeing who knows if the others 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.530
 maps will be equal 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.500
 but well I judge by this gameplay 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.100
 ok and if it's true I 'm one thing 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.920
 I was really shocked when I saw it and 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.770
 is that it resembles enough I would say that 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.450
 I do not know I was thinking about doing this 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.130
 video and the first thing that came to me 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.000
 head is to determine it 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.740
 Let's see 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.380
 the first thing that comes to mind for 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.840
 define 'medal of honor' is mixture between 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.120
 battlefield bad company 2 and battlefield 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.150
 3 is the first thing that came to my head 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.769
 because battlefield bad company 2 also 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.030
 I had some graphics a tad more 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.120
 shut down that 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.920
 that vettel that battlefield 3 that ya 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.520
 I say it's a bit more futuristic in 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.100
 how about the menus so blue tones yes 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.090
 it's a lot I 'm going to me to look like 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.760
 it's more futuristic - I do not tell you it's 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.669
 uses that we are talking about weapons of 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.040
 laser beams and things like that I do not mean 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.120
 from modern futurist in that sense 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.350
 but the menus are more pleasant to 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.570
 the view I do not know if I explain myself then 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.150
 I would define it as well as a mixture between 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.460
 both games are not coming to you and 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.630
 if it will be the same but it is what 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.350
 first that came to my head 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.020
 when I thought about doing an analysis of 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.629
 this game 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.270
 I could not prove it, I tell you but in 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:16.120
 how much you try it, they confirm in my 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.490
 opinions about this game and nothing guys 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.710
 I hope you liked a 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.710
 greeting and until next time
