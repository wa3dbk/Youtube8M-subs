water with ice different terrains you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
water with ice different terrains you
get<00:01:16.530> real<00:01:16.799> good<00:01:16.830> gripping<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.640> where<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
get real good gripping that's where the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
get real good gripping that's where the
thing<00:01:18.210> starts<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.560> took<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.799> same

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
thing starts and then we took that same

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
thing starts and then we took that same
lug<00:01:20.790> pattern<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.450> rolled<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:21.960> onto<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
lug pattern and rolled it up onto the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.420 
lug pattern and rolled it up onto the
sidewalk<00:01:23.159> where<00:01:24.000> most<00:01:24.619> boots<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.250> any

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
tread or any sidewall stability we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
tread or any sidewall stability we
rolled<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.729> tread<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> side<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.470> your

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
rolled that tread up on the side so your

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
rolled that tread up on the side so your
front<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> pitch<00:01:31.979> roof<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
additional traction with the outsole

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
pants what is an impact song and it's a

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.020 
pants what is an impact song and it's a
soft<00:04:16.789> gel<00:04:17.479> foam<00:04:17.780> but<00:04:18.440> on<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.709> impact<00:04:19.130> it

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
soft gel foam but on the impact it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.230 
soft gel foam but on the impact it
dissipates<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.139> impact

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
dissipates the impact

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.580 
dissipates the impact
you<00:04:22.599> take<00:04:22.870> this<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.289> impact

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
you take this and you get the impact

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.450 
you take this and you get the impact
dissipation

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
dissipation

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.520 
dissipation
what<00:04:27.910> we<00:04:28.060> did<00:04:28.240> here<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.539> put<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:28.960> in<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> ankle

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
what we did here is put it in the ankle

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.129 
what we did here is put it in the ankle
so<00:04:30.099> you<00:04:30.490> drop<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.060> coupling<00:04:31.449> on<00:04:31.569> your<00:04:31.750> ankle

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
so you drop it a coupling on your ankle

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.550 
so you drop it a coupling on your ankle
or<00:04:32.259> kicking<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.740> door<00:04:33.130> jam<00:04:33.490> in<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.660> smokey<00:04:35.169> dark

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
or kicking a door jam in the smokey dark

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.140 
or kicking a door jam in the smokey dark
environment<00:04:36.190> not<00:04:36.639> going<00:04:36.819> to<00:04:36.880> hurt<00:04:37.000> your

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
environment not going to hurt your

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.820 
environment not going to hurt your
ankles<00:04:37.509> so<00:04:37.660> this<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.139> something<00:04:38.440> else<00:04:38.620> with

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
ankles so this is something else with

ankles so this is something else with
the<00:04:38.919> first<00:04:39.130> ones<00:04:39.400> in<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.639> industry<00:04:40.030> to

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
the first ones in the industry to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.990 
the first ones in the industry to
