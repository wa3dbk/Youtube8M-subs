00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.099
 I took a trip without going too far 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.099
 far 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.640
 a trip to my own land 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.700
 in a little-told apulia 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.830
 an enthusiastic apulia the enthusiasm e 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.830
 commitment 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.990
 of people who love his work here and there 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 passion and the desire to learn a 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.130
 create that takes us forward 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.040
 an artisan apulia 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.150
 I wanted to tell a world of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.150
 sacrifices of traditions and modernity 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.130
 giving voice to the master craftsmen I have 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.510
 met the tenacity of the races of the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.820
 bread repays everything to them 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.830
 claims you do not do it 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.480
 angry because if we stop we will 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.400
 stops in the whole country 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.170
 just pull it hatch this law with 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.320
 these increases but it is and above all to 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.110
 beauty of their work and everything is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 fruit of inspiration and dexterity 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.990
 in short, I feel like a artist myself 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.100
 and this journey has become mine 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.100
