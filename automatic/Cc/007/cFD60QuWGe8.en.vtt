00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.230
 recently we have talked about the 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.360
 popular anime of sing equinox gene 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.870
 which the truth is great but in 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.939
 finish 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.250
 similarly derived to all this has been 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.250
 decided to make an adaptation to the cinema 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.750
 about this same universe being nothing 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.140
 more and nothing less than done by the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 known by all eye this adaptation 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.880
 will have two films the first one was 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.190
 released a few weeks ago in 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.080
 Japan while the second part will be 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.809
 released in the very next month of 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.120
 September but specifically today 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.920
 we'll talk about the first part itself 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.309
 I had the opportunity to see a couple of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.870
 days and well before I start I would like to 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.180
 warn that this video will have 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.549
 some spoilers of both the movie 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.519
 like anime and manga so now 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.769
 are warned singh equinox gym 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.350
 basically has the same scoop 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.600
 of the anime and the manga but in case 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.510
 someone already forgot I remember it 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.700
 the sudden appearance of gigantic 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.710
 titans has brought mankind almost 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.780
 on the brink of extinction the few 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.000
 survivors have had to take refuge 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.340
 inside huge walls 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.280
 and prevent the titans from entering trying 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.500
 to survive as much as possible to simple 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.560
 view we would have the same story without 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.330
 But this is not how we know the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.700
 original story begins with the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.680
 appearance of the colossal titan and death 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.630
 from the mother of eren so that from there in 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.390
 further develop a series of 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.700
 events derived from that but in 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 the movie this never happens the mother of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.170
 eren is not devoured is more never appears 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.410
 which is replaced by a sequence 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.330
 very pretty, although it is understandable that 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.640
 was going to do a copy and paste with the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.009
 original story and this one was not going to be 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.920
 just like the truth this seems like a 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.840
 very radical change but in general the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.149
 history does not look like anything already seen 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.619
 in the anime and manga since most 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.649
 of the film tells a story 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.619
 totally new many things do not 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.720
 explained and omitted many others the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.759
 name of the walls and the three factions 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.770
 it is possible to join after 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.080
 graduate in no time are 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.260
 mentioned even though if they appear 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.540
 in the film it would be nice if at 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.200
 unless this one was good it's true has 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.180
 your moments 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.970
 but most of it does not become 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.920
 entertaining more than anything because of 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.319
 personality change of most 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.500
 the characters since these are also not 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.300
 they look nothing like manga 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 they were not seeing their mother die does not have 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.069
 thirst for revenge and even if you see die to 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.040
 many others this one never looks so 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.650
 impulsive armin is not the weak guy of the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.099
 group this even seems a secondary 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.480
 and my house because nothing to do with the series 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.670
 many key characters were 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.040
 eliminated at least for this first 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.290
 part I do not know if in the second part 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.079
 appear but I doubt it 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.450
 characters like cold and ami and even the 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.340
 father of eren shine by his absence and 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.890
 instead they add to new ones that 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.569
 they are just filling they are very forgettable 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.360
 and in truth that the name change 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.190
 should psyche for me was a shit 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.760
 and even more so being one of the characters 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.769
 most important and the few that are 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.170
 little or nothing have to do with manga 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.000
 unlike the original story 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.400
 where seeing someone die was 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.680
 shocking arriving at times to be 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 very depressed here the role of upson 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.060
 all the characters are deficient 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.150
 that all the characters can die 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.459
 and you will not feel bad at 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.430
 want to tell a new story this is not 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.859
 it is neither good and much less interesting to the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.109
 except I think most of us 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.849
 we expected something more attached to the manga 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.650
 clear that with its changes and 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.079
 restrictions but the truth the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.269
 totally different argument results 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.950
 disappointing 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.019
 together with that the actions by 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.909
 moments are very overactive is 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.680
 obvious that the intense drama that 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.069
 characterizes this series does not 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.169
 appearance is not about emulating that not 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.939
 it comes to me but it does not get to be 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.060
 level of the first chapters of the 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.040
 series you notice that the movies of all 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.019
 they have not changed much since like 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.570
 that years ago with his films of 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.759
 monsters we almost always had one that 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.709
 another movie with a passable argument 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.710
 but with some monsters scenes 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.900
 really good and in the case of jean 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.580
 jacques and nokia gym this is repeated already 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.130
 that while the story and characters 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.200
 they leave much to be desired titans here 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.780
 yes they were outstanding 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.120
 the use of cg and itself is good so 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.280
 least I can say that it does not look so fake 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.620
 the colossal titan looks 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.170
 extraordinarily well like the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.530
 rest of titans which are super 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.690
 creepy if in the manga and in the anime it 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.880
 they looked disturbing here this was 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.580
 multiplied and like good Japanese 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.530
 these are scary , the 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.900
 added that the titans make noises 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.390
 and they even laugh this makes them more 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.340
 scary but I still do not like the 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.850
 everything since at least I prefer that 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.970
 be silent you can not deny without 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.650
 doubt the titans take the film 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.740
 as is characteristic of the franchise 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.240
 the large amounts of blood and 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.640
 dismemberments are very abundant and 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.270
 incredibly graphic in that there's no 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.640
 All complaints are brutal and I reiterate the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.830
 Titans fulfill their role very well and 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.680
 I could say that is the only reason 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.050
 watch the movie the action along the 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.730
 film is not very abundant that we say and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.490
 the sequences with the teams of 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.790
 maneuvers are very short and are limited to 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.370
 appear almost finished the film 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.590
 in general these sequences are not very 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.630
 good to say and of course not 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.790
 they have the same equity that is appreciated 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.800
 in the anime because of its own time 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.040
 on the screen is not much these are not 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.690
 they are so exciting something that I 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.250
 it seems very well achieved 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.920
 are the locations where 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.380
 develops the film and although they are not 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.110
 not similar to the originals and 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.570
 these seem more post apocalyptic and 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.450
 a little more modernized these look 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.940
 very well nor how to deny the appearance 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.990
 sound does not stand out much is not so good 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.150
 not so bad summarizing singh equinox 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.980
 gym is not a good film changes by 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.590
 full story and characters 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.140
 proposing an original argument that does not 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.350
 It works well, being boring and 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.480
 tedious perhaps it is mainly the 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.400
 start and end sequences by 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.740
 those that are more worth watching the film 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.960
 but in general it is not recommended nor 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.790
 for fans since they probably do not 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.400
 like the changes they made 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.480
 and as a film itself it's not very good that 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.120
 let say 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.220
 the titans pretty much raise a little 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.590
 the action in the movie but they stay 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.320
 half-baked and it's not enough reason as 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.180
 to see the rest of the film and the truth 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.180
 I doubt very much that in the second part 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:02.220
 correct these errors I give you a 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.220
 rating of 5 out of 10
