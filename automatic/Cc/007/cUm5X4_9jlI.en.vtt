on and here you go that's the latch of
the<00:00:53.780> original<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the original one and you can see the you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.110 
the original one and you can see the you
miss<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> tooth<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:02.070> should<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
miss a tooth and it should be have to to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
miss a tooth and it should be have to to
catch<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.010> catch<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
catch it when I go one way you catch it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
catch it when I go one way you catch it
when<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:06.000> backwards<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.659> since<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
when go backwards and this since the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
when go backwards and this since the
spring<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.640> pushed<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.140> can

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
spring would be pushed down so you can

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
spring would be pushed down so you can
go<00:01:13.439> backwards<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.310> forward<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.240> catch

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
go backwards go forward they will catch

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.649 
go backwards go forward they will catch
the<00:01:16.409> real<00:01:16.590> theis<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.520> safa<00:01:17.880> propel<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:20.659> this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the real theis for safa propel and this

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
the real theis for safa propel and this
video<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> already<00:01:22.290> found<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
video I already found out of the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.330 
video I already found out of the
province<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.590> he<00:01:25.680> order<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> part

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
province so how would he order the part

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
province so how would he order the part
and<00:01:27.080> here<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> new<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:30.140> it'll<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and here is the new one and it'll be the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.120 
and here is the new one and it'll be the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
new one and you see the since the spring

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.109 
new one and you see the since the spring
loaded<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.570> forward<00:01:37.369> goat<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.610> forward

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
loaded when I go forward goat it forward

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
loaded when I go forward goat it forward
they<00:01:40.110> were<00:01:40.520> move<00:01:41.960> windy<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.530> real<00:01:43.920> tire<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
they were move windy are the real tire a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.749 
they were move windy are the real tire a
wheel<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:46.170> forward<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.130> backwards

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
wheel go forward when you go backwards

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.819 
wheel go forward when you go backwards
this<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.920> at<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> screen<00:01:50.369> where<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:52.320> move

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
this way and at the screen where I move

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
this way and at the screen where I move
the<00:01:53.040> t's<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.090> will<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> catch

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the t's back so will not a catch

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.580 
the t's back so will not a catch
anything<00:01:55.219> so<00:01:56.219> that's<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.380> problem

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
anything so that's it that's the problem

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.010 
anything so that's it that's the problem
and<00:01:59.270> then<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.390> put<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> back<00:02:01.530> arm

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.750 

that's<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.950> washer<00:02:11.430> here

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that's it and then it's a washer here

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:28.690 
that's it and then it's a washer here
and<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:13.080> put<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.380> at<00:02:13.530> higher<00:02:13.740> so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.610 

now<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.480> put<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> bottom<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:36.470> archer<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
now you put a bottom and the archer you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.310 
now you put a bottom and the archer you
really<00:02:37.950> don't<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.690> flip<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> mower<00:02:40.170> like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
really don't have to flip the mower like

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.280 
really don't have to flip the mower like
lotta<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.130> change<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:42.270> listen<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.140> is

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
lotta to change the listen have to is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.750 
lotta to change the listen have to is
when<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> tied<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:44.190> way<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:47.520> whole

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
when you tied it this way the the whole

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.660 
when you tied it this way the the whole
driving<00:02:49.040> axle<00:02:50.040> will<00:02:50.370> locate<00:02:51.230> backwards<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.280> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
driving axle will locate backwards so I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.330 
driving axle will locate backwards so I
do<00:02:54.600> use<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.200> prior<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.010> hold<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:58.380> driving<00:02:58.740> chef

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
do use a prior to hold the driving chef

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.330 
do use a prior to hold the driving chef
and<00:02:59.870> then<00:03:00.870> you're<00:03:01.050> tight<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.190> make

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and then you're tight so you can make

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.100 
and then you're tight so you can make
sure<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:03.000> pretty<00:03:03.240> tight<00:03:03.920> okay<00:03:04.950> that's<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
sure it's a pretty tight okay that's the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.040 
sure it's a pretty tight okay that's the
videotape<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.430> how<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> find<00:03:08.880> out<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.450> problem

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
videotape of how to find out the problem

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.970 
videotape of how to find out the problem
