00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.039
 the dms sorting gripper of the sg series 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.089
 achieve their compact and robustness 

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:13.339
 through the innovative patented 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.499
 Hydraulic cylinder in this 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.289
 Hydraulic cylinder becomes a piston 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.910
 you can move between two oil 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.980
 a vulnerable to damage 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.810
 piston rod deleted from the in 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.580
 Cylinder integrated oil channels 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.130
 accounts for hydraulic hoses and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.079
 piping in the work area so that 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.379
 the danger for a failure of sortier 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.300
 gripper is minimized over the bolt 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.829
 and will couple both the power of 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.230
 pistons on claw shells 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.300
 transmit as well as the tracking 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.760
 the unique cylinder ensures 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.309
 construction allows a complete 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.899
 encapsulation of the piston and guaranteed 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.649
 thus an effective protection 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.649
 damage 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.610
 all bolts are in brass boxes with 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.470
 Bold chambers stored like an optimal one 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.170
 material mating and long-term lubrication 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.280
 Offer 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.270
 This is what makes the mature special 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.270
 maintenance 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.090
 through the sophisticated design offers 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.770
 the claws an optimum grasping space 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.720
 It can be done both at complete 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.660
 open claw shells wide 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.550
 objects seized as well as at 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:41.210
 closed claw shells smallest 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:43.400
 objects are clamped since the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.920
 Hydraulic cylinder itself the bearing 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.790
 element for the claw damage is a 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.410
 fall more components 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.930
 as a result, the claw has an extreme 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.280
 low construction height and a reduced 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.190
 own weight 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 the dms sortier griffes is thus best 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.740
 for use on compact excavators 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740
 suitable
