00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.380
 thousands of dollars in drugs spend 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.750
 annually for the territory 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.730
 Guatemalan leaving behind violence 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.589
 and death to fight against it the 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.330
 state has had to arm itself of units 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.759
 specials that operate in different 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.740
 areas to combat this scourge the 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.929
 Naval special force is the best weapon 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.910
 with which the country is at sea 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.429
 unit has developed operations both 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.250
 in the Pacific Ocean as in the ocean 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.690
 Atlantic supporting operations this 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
 of 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.510
 maritime security naval safeguard 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.340
 and maritime patrol that they developed 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.410
 before the naval commands the ocean 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 pacifico is without a doubt the platform 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.260
 perfect that the drug traffickers 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.060
 they need to send the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.950
 narcotics to the north of 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.080
 continent what makes it necessary 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.559
 keep a strict watch on their 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.750
 waters 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.390
 we are contributing to that 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.550
 this not this not in these illicit 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.309
 enter our country and the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.879
 violence during its different 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.280
 manipulation is better to capture it outside 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.589
 that will be safer for all the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.590
 citizenship 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.000
 allow or effect the catches in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.009
 within the territory that is going to be more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.799
 violent just last year 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.770
 this elite unit confiscated 1.8 tons 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 of drugs, which represents more than 50% 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 of total narcotics withheld 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 by the authorities but not all 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 drug travels over water in July 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.899
 2010 a semisubmersible was captured with 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.569
 four crew and tons of 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.840
 cocaine was an operation that was conducted 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.729
 for more than nine hours in a row at 135 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.799
 nautical miles away where it was 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.130
 deployed one of the strength boats 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.599
 naval special in conjunction with aircraft 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 of the Guatemalan air force and 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:48.899
 assault aircraft was managed to interdict 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.689
 there five tons were seized 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.759
 a ship of the same type was captured a 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 year before from Colombia and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.929
 conscious and tons more of this drug 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.819
 but it is impossible to prevent 100 per 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.860
 hundred of the drug touch earth what 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.189
 turns this into a war with many 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.189
 scenarios 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.970
 as they are special units have the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.060
 ability to conduct operations both 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.900
 in the sea as on land and some 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.490
 airborne operations have very 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.650
 good training to be able to effect 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.320
 this kind of tasks 12 nautical miles 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.150
 encompass Guatemalan waters from 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.950
 of the coast but the surveillance is 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.690
 extends far beyond this border 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.000
 aquatic both outward and towards 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.160
 in rivers and channels near the sea 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.690
 They are used as a means of transport 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.310
 for the drug what forces to maintain 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.890
 under the gaze all kinds of 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.480
 vessels transiting through them 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.489
 naval special force was created makes 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.190
 four years as the elite unit of the 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.560
 Guatemalan Navy and currently with 86 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.989
 members and 10 ships type boston wyler 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.120
 nicknamed justice in English are the 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.980
 main protagonists of a war 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.190
 aquatic are being denied in these 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.190
 spaces 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.510
 operating within organized crime in 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.099
 which denies space because 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.450
 consider that the presence of this 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.630
 unit can limit its operations 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.670
 then they take different destiny to that of 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.450
 Guatemala can be to other countries 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.220
 neighbors 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.930
 Guatemalan waters may 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.910
 represent for some the way 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.680
 perfect for drug trafficking but 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.540
 for this special unit is the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.540
 scenario of a war without rest
