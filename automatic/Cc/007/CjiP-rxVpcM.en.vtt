that's<00:02:16.150> why<00:02:16.270> all<00:02:16.330> my<00:02:16.450> bodybuilder<00:02:16.930> friends

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
that's why all my bodybuilder friends

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.220 
that's why all my bodybuilder friends
they<00:02:17.290> call<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.739> male<00:02:18.100> beauty<00:02:18.520> pageant<00:02:19.230> but

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
they call it a male beauty pageant but

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.960 
they call it a male beauty pageant but
there's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> lot<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.920> learning<00:02:21.070> for<00:02:21.400> both<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.760> lot

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
there's a lot of learning for both a lot

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.790 
there's a lot of learning for both a lot
of<00:02:22.090> bodies<00:02:22.360> others<00:02:22.630> they<00:02:22.810> train<00:02:23.050> piloting<00:02:23.620> for

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
of bodies others they train piloting for

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.020 
of bodies others they train piloting for
a<00:02:23.830> period<00:02:24.070> of<00:02:24.100> time<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.430> build<00:02:24.580> thickness

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
a period of time to build thickness

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.780 
a period of time to build thickness
build<00:02:25.480> muscular<00:02:25.690> strength<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.430> when<00:02:27.730> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
build muscular strength so that when I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
build muscular strength so that when I
step<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.120> stage<00:02:28.420> they<00:02:28.600> can<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.989> really

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
step on stage they can have that really

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.009 
step on stage they can have that really
thick<00:02:29.500> floor<00:02:29.860> look<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> same<00:02:31.390> token<00:02:31.600> a

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
thick floor look and on the same token a

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.960 
thick floor look and on the same token a
lot<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.350> power<00:02:32.530> lifters<00:02:32.980> your<00:02:33.100> change<00:02:33.340> body

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
lot of power lifters your change body

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.550 
lot of power lifters your change body
building<00:02:34.299> style<00:02:34.570> have<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> body<00:02:35.049> building<00:02:35.380> day

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
building style have a body building day

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.830 
building style have a body building day
so<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.580> bring<00:02:36.820> up<00:02:37.000> weak<00:02:37.450> little

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
so that they can bring up weak little

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.420 
so that they can bring up weak little
muscles<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.530> are<00:02:38.680> gonna<00:02:38.769> help<00:02:38.980> them<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.280> go

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
muscles that are gonna help them I go

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.920 
muscles that are gonna help them I go
let's<00:02:40.120> say<00:02:40.209> for<00:02:40.390> bench

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
let's say for bench

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900 
let's say for bench
it<00:02:41.590> has<00:02:41.739> promise<00:02:42.100> stabilizing<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:42.730> they'll

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
it has promise stabilizing so they'll

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.870 
it has promise stabilizing so they'll
hit<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.930> one<00:02:44.230> sliver<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.890> shoulder<00:02:45.489> muscle

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
hit like one sliver of shoulder muscle

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.910 
hit like one sliver of shoulder muscle
to<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.959> part<00:02:47.170> stronger<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
to get that part stronger in a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.650 
to get that part stronger in a
bodybuilding<00:02:48.459> rep<00:02:48.640> range<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.299> think<00:02:49.420> that's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
bodybuilding rep range so I think that's

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
bodybuilding rep range so I think that's
the<00:02:49.750> biggest<00:02:49.930> difference<00:02:50.200> personally<00:02:51.070> for<00:02:51.190> me

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the biggest difference personally for me

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.330 
the biggest difference personally for me
that<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.820> believe<00:02:54.209> huh

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.540 

here<00:03:01.340> comes<00:03:01.700> another<00:03:02.110> fucked-up<00:03:03.110> one

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
here comes another fucked-up one

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.370 
here comes another fucked-up one
everyone<00:03:04.550> prides<00:03:04.820> themselves<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.690> looking

everyone prides themselves and looking

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.750 
everyone prides themselves and looking
good<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.740> know<00:03:06.860> like<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.340> comb<00:03:07.550> your<00:03:07.580> hair

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
good you know like you comb your hair

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.300 
good you know like you comb your hair
your<00:03:08.120> iron<00:03:08.300> your<00:03:08.510> clothes<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:09.800> to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
your iron your clothes so I think to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.440 
your iron your clothes so I think to
everyone<00:03:10.640> presentation<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.420> really

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
everyone presentation is really

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.810 
everyone presentation is really
important<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.860> especially<00:03:13.130> if<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.580> train

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
important and especially if you train

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.790 
important and especially if you train
like<00:03:14.000> an<00:03:14.150> athlete<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:15.200> want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.410> look<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.560> an

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
like an athlete you want to look like an

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.370 
like an athlete you want to look like an
athlete<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> think<00:03:17.750> there<00:03:17.900> are<00:03:17.990> different

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
athlete but I think there are different

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.410 
athlete but I think there are different
phases<00:03:18.620> where<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.280> know<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:19.730> goal<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.210> more

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
phases where you know one goal is more

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.720 
phases where you know one goal is more
important<00:03:20.840> than<00:03:20.960> the<00:03:21.050> other<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.550> past

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
important than the other so for the past

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.700 
important than the other so for the past
couple<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.090> months<00:03:23.150> I've<00:03:23.840> been<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.050> Bolton<00:03:24.440> case

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
couple of months I've been a Bolton case

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.920 
couple of months I've been a Bolton case
that's<00:03:25.580> on<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.850> found<00:03:26.120> purpose<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.840> can

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that's on you found purpose but I can

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.600 
that's on you found purpose but I can
get<00:03:27.050> really<00:03:27.200> strong<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.160> did<00:03:28.310> get<00:03:28.460> really

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
get really strong and I did get really

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.080 
get really strong and I did get really
strong<00:03:28.820> nice<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.540> do<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:29.750> whole<00:03:29.960> circuit<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
strong nice to do this whole circuit and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.340 
strong nice to do this whole circuit and
like<00:03:32.920> 110<00:03:33.920> minutes<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.900> looked<00:03:35.900> after<00:03:36.020> clock

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
like 110 minutes I looked after clock

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.950 
like 110 minutes I looked after clock
I'm<00:03:37.100> halfway<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:38.540> only<00:03:38.660> been<00:03:38.750> 10

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
I'm halfway and it's only been 10

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.620 
I'm halfway and it's only been 10
minutes<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.940> got<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> lot<00:03:41.180> stronger

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
minutes I got a lot stronger

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.330 
minutes I got a lot stronger
I'm<00:03:42.530> also<00:03:42.680> that's<00:03:43.010> back<00:03:43.540> cardio<00:03:45.100> that's<00:03:46.100> balls

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
I'm also that's back cardio that's balls

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.080 
I'm also that's back cardio that's balls
but<00:03:46.970> now<00:03:47.120> it's<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.890> cutting<00:03:48.890> face<00:03:49.070> again<00:03:49.880> I

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
but now it's in the cutting face again I

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.770 
but now it's in the cutting face again I
think<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:51.320> bulky<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:52.010> cutting<00:03:52.570> purposes<00:03:53.570> of

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
think the bulky and cutting purposes of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.020 
think the bulky and cutting purposes of
a<00:03:54.050> positive<00:03:55.010> thing<00:03:55.220> why<00:03:55.550> it's<00:03:55.730> way<00:03:55.850> different

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
a positive thing why it's way different

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.020 
a positive thing why it's way different
and<00:03:56.300> bodybuilding<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:56.990> when<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:57.890> balked<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.580> was

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
and bodybuilding is when I balked I was

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.840 
and bodybuilding is when I balked I was
to<00:03:59.180> get<00:03:59.330> strong<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.050> then<00:04:00.680> when<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.040> cut<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.640> so

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
to get strong and then when I cut it so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.000 
to get strong and then when I cut it so
that<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.030> could<00:04:02.240> make<00:04:02.330> weight<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.650> purpose

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
that I could make weight so the purpose

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.550 
that I could make weight so the purpose
behind<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.550> is<00:04:04.760> still<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.360> functional<00:04:05.990> purpose

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
behind it is still a functional purpose

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.830 
behind it is still a functional purpose
I'm<00:04:06.800> not<00:04:07.070> cutting<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.420> look<00:04:08.540> back

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
I'm not cutting so I can look back

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.540 
I'm not cutting so I can look back
together<00:04:09.080> and<00:04:09.350> get<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.500> six-pack<00:04:09.980> that's<00:04:10.220> just

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
together and get a six-pack that's just

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.580 
together and get a six-pack that's just
a<00:04:10.730> side<00:04:11.240> effect<00:04:11.270> of<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.870> that's<00:04:12.350> why<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.530> think

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
a side effect of it that's why I think

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.230 
a side effect of it that's why I think
when<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:12.920> first<00:04:12.950> started<00:04:13.520> working<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:13.910> getting

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
really serious I kind of gravitated

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.360 
really serious I kind of gravitated
towards<00:04:17.000> more<00:04:17.180> powerlifting<00:04:17.750> because<00:04:18.739> I'd

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
towards more powerlifting because I'd

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.250 
towards more powerlifting because I'd
rather<00:04:19.580> just<00:04:19.880> train<00:04:20.270> like<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.600> athlete<00:04:21.020> and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
rather just train like the athlete and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.370 
rather just train like the athlete and
then<00:04:21.380> look<00:04:21.590> like<00:04:21.799> an<00:04:21.950> athlete<00:04:22.100> than<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.380> train

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
then look like an athlete than to train

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.230 
then look like an athlete than to train
to<00:04:24.710> look<00:04:24.860> like<00:04:24.980> an<00:04:25.100> athlete<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.700> mean<00:04:26.120> there's
