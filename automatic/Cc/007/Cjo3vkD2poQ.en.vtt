 Hi, this is Real. 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.660
 This lecture is a lecture to create an effect when cutting something. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.320
 So let's get started! 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.520
 Right click on my costume - effects - Let's add a particle. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420
 Then set the bones to none. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 Adjust the position to make it look better. 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.300
 Then follow me as I do. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 However, the size can be arbitrarily adjusted by viewers. 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.720
 Click ... next to the material box to select the material that the red triangle points to. 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 Then turn off the contrast check. 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.160
 Let's adjust the start and end lengths to 100 or more. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.720
 Then set the value of -50 at the end of gravity to 0 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.260
 If you set the spread factor to 0 ... 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 It is the effect completion. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.200
 I have a slight blunt feeling so I should adjust the size. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.700
 This effect is available to viewers as you would expect from a cutlery PAC. 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.240
 As an example, let me show you the PAC I used in the previous episode of Wind Country. 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.940
 In this way. 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.780
 Part 36 will be an introductory course to create such an intangible effect. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.760
 This tutorial is here. Let's see it in section 36!
