00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
better perspective on it here we go okay

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.370 
better perspective on it here we go okay
I'll<00:01:17.600> do<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.020> first<00:01:18.500> part<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.550> solo<00:01:20.479> real

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
I'll do the first part of that solo real

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:47.980 
I'll do the first part of that solo real
slow<00:01:21.680> for<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:22.910> go<00:01:45.970> okay<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.720> it's

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
slow for you here we go okay so it's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.770 
slow for you here we go okay so it's
basically<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.649> combination<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.550> doubles<00:01:50.000> with

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
basically a combination of doubles with

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.530 
basically a combination of doubles with
accents<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.700> think<00:01:52.850> if<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.240> want<00:01:53.450> to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
accents and so I think if you want to

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.350 
accents and so I think if you want to
learn<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.869> solo<00:01:54.110> start<00:01:54.590> out<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:54.979> do<00:01:55.399> your

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
learn the solo start out and do your

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.680 
learn the solo start out and do your
double<00:01:56.600> stroke<00:01:57.140> roll<00:01:57.170> with<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.100> bass<00:01:58.490> drum

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.990 

okay<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.049> then<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.220> next<00:02:04.580> thing<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.850> might

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
okay and then the next thing you might

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.270 
okay and then the next thing you might
want<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.299> work<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.229> five<00:02:06.680> stroke<00:02:07.040> roll

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
want to work on is a five stroke roll

want to work on is a five stroke roll
which<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:13.600> okay<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.019> then<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.560> work<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:18.790> the
