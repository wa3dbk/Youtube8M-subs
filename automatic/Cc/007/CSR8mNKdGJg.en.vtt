harder first what I did about four or
five<00:00:09.179> days<00:00:09.420> ago<00:00:10.219> it's<00:00:11.219> not<00:00:11.400> completed<00:00:12.090> yet<00:00:12.120> but

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
five days ago it's not completed yet but

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.259 
five days ago it's not completed yet but
it<00:00:13.200> does<00:00:13.500> run<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> very<00:00:15.000> good

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
it does run and it is a very good

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.830 
it does run and it is a very good
example<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:16.789> good<00:00:18.090> was<00:00:18.330> back<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
example of how good was back in the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320 
example of how good was back in the
day<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.260> air<00:00:19.619> compressor<00:00:19.949> pumps<00:00:20.490> right

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
day about air compressor pumps right

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.070 
day about air compressor pumps right
here<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.340> cam<00:00:23.340> bouhaus<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.330> believe<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
here I have a cam bouhaus I believe it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.310 
here I have a cam bouhaus I believe it
pronounced<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.470> correctly<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:27.570> goes<00:00:27.840> all

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
pronounced that correctly it goes all

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.240 
pronounced that correctly it goes all
the<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:29.119> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.300> 120<00:00:31.170> psi<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the way to you know 120 psi and then the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.780 
the way to you know 120 psi and then the
pop<00:00:32.430> valve<00:00:32.700> pops<00:00:33.000> open<00:00:34.280> all<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.760> a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
no pressure in it basically I've got
this<00:01:11.360> 1950s<00:01:13.159> air<00:01:14.159> compressor<00:01:14.970> pump<00:01:15.270> right

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this 1950s air compressor pump right

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.590 
this 1950s air compressor pump right
here<00:01:16.340> nutnfancy<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.689> rated<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:20.600> believe

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
here nutnfancy it's rated at a I believe

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
here nutnfancy it's rated at a I believe
it<00:01:21.780> says<00:01:22.189> 1100<00:01:23.189> rpm<00:01:23.759> plus<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it says 1100 rpm plus so you know it's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.020 
it says 1100 rpm plus so you know it's
old-school

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
old-school

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.719 
old-school
I<00:01:27.210> should<00:01:27.990> technically<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.619> copper<00:01:29.100> running

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I should technically have copper running

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
I should technically have copper running
right<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:29.909> instead<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.509> little<00:01:31.040> air

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
right here instead of this little air

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.569 
right here instead of this little air
hose<00:01:32.810> because<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.470> gets<00:01:34.560> hot<00:01:34.799> we've

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
hose because you know it gets hot we've

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.010 
hose because you know it gets hot we've
got<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:36.170> 99<00:01:37.170> cc<00:01:37.829> motor<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.810> off

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
got a little 99 cc motor that I got off

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.340 
got a little 99 cc motor that I got off
of<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:41.009> I'm<00:01:41.700> putting<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.270> back<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
of that I'm putting it back on it but

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.830 
of that I'm putting it back on it but
this<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.030> an<00:01:45.210> example<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this right here is this an example of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
this right here is this an example of
how<00:01:46.409> fast<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.840> works

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
how fast you know this thing works

00:01:50.430 --> 00:03:01.850 
how fast you know this thing works
I'm<00:01:50.580> at<00:01:52.700> zero<00:01:53.700> psi<00:01:54.770> started<00:01:55.770> up

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.610 

so<00:03:02.860> there<00:03:03.670> was<00:03:03.819> my<00:03:03.970> demonstration<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:05.409> is<00:03:05.590> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
so there was my demonstration that is a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.509 
so there was my demonstration that is a
2<00:03:05.830> gallon<00:03:06.430> tank<00:03:06.730> filled<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.569> up<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.159> I<00:03:09.159> think

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
2 gallon tank filled it up and I think

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.399 
2 gallon tank filled it up and I think
about<00:03:09.790> 35<00:03:10.629> seconds

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
about 35 seconds

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.740 
about 35 seconds
so<00:03:12.540> I'm<00:03:13.540> putting<00:03:13.810> out<00:03:13.930> quite<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.230> bit<00:03:14.379> of<00:03:14.470> error

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
so I'm putting out quite a bit of error

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.319 
so I'm putting out quite a bit of error
the<00:03:16.750> motor<00:03:17.019> was<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.500> probably<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.579> want<00:03:19.209> to

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
the motor was that probably I want to

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.789 
the motor was that probably I want to
say<00:03:20.610> 1500<00:03:21.610> rpm

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
say 1500 rpm

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.350 
say 1500 rpm
maybe<00:03:23.799> ex<00:03:24.310> allied<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.909> probably<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.239> little

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
maybe ex allied is probably a little

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.569 
maybe ex allied is probably a little
more<00:03:25.599> than<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.470> motor<00:03:26.680> what<00:03:27.159> the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
more than that but the motor what the

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.100 
more than that but the motor what the
air<00:03:27.819> compressor<00:03:28.239> pump<00:03:28.480> was<00:03:28.690> putting<00:03:28.989> out

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
air compressor pump was putting out

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.220 
air compressor pump was putting out
pretty<00:03:29.440> good<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.489> run<00:03:30.640> in<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.940> air<00:03:31.150> my<00:03:32.049> air

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
pretty good I can run in and air my air

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.250 
pretty good I can run in and air my air
ratchet<00:03:32.500> off<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:34.660> requires<00:03:35.019> about

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
ratchet off of it and it requires about

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.000 
ratchet off of it and it requires about
five<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.950> half<00:03:36.030> CFM<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:38.260> can<00:03:38.530> sit<00:03:38.829> there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
five and a half CFM and I can sit there

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.190 
five and a half CFM and I can sit there
and<00:03:39.220> use<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.489> at<00:03:39.879> about<00:03:40.150> 60<00:03:40.739> psi<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
and use it at about 60 psi and the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.869 
and use it at about 60 psi and the
compressor<00:03:44.709> keeps<00:03:44.890> up<00:03:45.159> perfectly<00:03:45.670> without

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
compressor keeps up perfectly without

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.910 
compressor keeps up perfectly without
going<00:03:46.450> any<00:03:46.599> higher<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:50.079> is<00:03:50.379> an<00:03:50.709> example

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
going any higher but that is an example

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.720 
going any higher but that is an example
of<00:03:51.930> how<00:03:52.930> easy<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.739> simple<00:03:53.799> this<00:03:54.250> works

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
of how easy and simple this works

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.110 
of how easy and simple this works
top<00:03:55.269> valve<00:03:55.510> pops<00:03:55.810> off<00:03:56.109> at<00:03:56.590> about<00:03:56.920> an<00:03:57.849> hour

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
top valve pops off at about an hour

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.979 
top valve pops off at about an hour
about<00:03:58.299> 45<00:03:58.810> 50<00:03:59.079> psi<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.190> or<00:04:01.500> 120<00:04:02.500> psi<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:03.430> pops

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
about 45 50 psi and or 120 psi it pops

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.360 
about 45 50 psi and or 120 psi it pops
pops<00:04:04.989> off<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.230> lets<00:04:05.650> all<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.889> air<00:04:06.010> out<00:04:06.040> and

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
pops off and lets all the air out and

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.659 
pops off and lets all the air out and
then<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:07.359> know<00:04:07.389> kicks<00:04:07.780> back<00:04:07.989> in<00:04:08.200> at<00:04:08.319> about<00:04:08.669> 50

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
then you know kicks back in at about 50

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.569 
then you know kicks back in at about 50
psi<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.549> little

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
psi so that's just a little

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.390 
psi so that's just a little
demonstration<00:04:13.299> so<00:04:14.160> comment<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.280> write

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
demonstration so comment and write

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.209 
demonstration so comment and write
thanks<00:04:15.879> like
