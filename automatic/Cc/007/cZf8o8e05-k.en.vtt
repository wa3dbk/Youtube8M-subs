00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.759
 Here I have a little video to one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.010
 text task the typical is actually 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.690
 the third bionic formula hears the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.800
 is that in it even if it is 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.040
 because one or the other maybe even 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
 does not see the task is as follows 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.930
 a square plot with one 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.689
 Area of ​​900 square meters will open 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.029
 One side extended by five meters 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.760
 the other side not facing 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 The question is shortened by five meters 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.380
 is the area remains the same or 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.620
 another question could be his computer 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.870
 areas of content of the new area or the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.469
 that they know what they know with 1 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 I 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.540
 In any case, the principle must be proven 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.140
 that the area is not the same here 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.530
 noticed 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.360
 I have it on the side of this one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.719
 square plot times 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.120
 drawn and the individual pages long 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.539
 with fix is ​​called a square 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 that must be the same and long 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.260
 I also think it clear to everyone if we 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.629
 know that the year is 900 square meters 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.739
 then that's her 30, that's 30 too 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 but that's what it's all about 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.600
 Do not be on one side than you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.880
 given five meters 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.229
 Let's take this page here 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.759
 Here come 5 meters to see everyone 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 that the plot is actually 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.720
 getting bigger but the other 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.850
 not opposite side that must 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.009
 so be the one or the other up here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 the opposite one is over here 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.049
 so the non- opposing will be around 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.049
 shortened by five meters 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.330
 then i have a new area here and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.330
 this area has lengths following pages 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 the page length up here is now 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.899
 plus these five meters 6 plus 5 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.850
 the times here the plot 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:13.040
 is still going on here is nothing - 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:16.040
 and now I have the square 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.890
 rectangle you can see here now 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.750
 Also that the formula is clear for that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 legally, length means width 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.209
 So x5 x iks - that's what we're screaming for now 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:42.110
 just new here on the side 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:43.430
 area plus x iks - and now sees the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.049
 one or the other may have that 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.299
 Here is the third genomic formula 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.860
 it would not be that way 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.480
 there may indeed like under the old pattern 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.350
 multiply from this 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.540
 that with the idea that with the and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.250
 we'll get that with that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.780
 let out in detail 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:08.470
 x times xr gives ex square x times minus 5 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.470
 and minus five to plus 5 x xx 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:20.120
 plus / minus five gives - 25 we see that 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:26.930
 - 5x to 5 that falls off so stay 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:29.299
 left here ex square - 25x square was 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:35.239
 yes my original area here 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.890
 this blue big -25 means it's falling 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.600
 a little bit actually and 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.630
 again go away and that is this 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.579
 small piece this falls away thus 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.459
 you can say very clearly 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.360
 the new area is not constant because 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.970
 she rooms around this 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.530
 square here this number here 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.530
 appear shortened
