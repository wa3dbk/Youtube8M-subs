00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.850 
practice to position
let's<00:02:11.700> practice<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.210> so<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> muscle

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
let's practice it so you like the muscle

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.610 
let's practice it so you like the muscle
memory<00:02:13.980> hand<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:14.970> know<00:02:15.150> what<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:19.380> do

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
memory hand so you just know what you do

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.430 
memory hand so you just know what you do
it<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.300> say<00:02:21.510> practice<00:02:21.810> about<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.200> ten

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
it that I say practice about like ten

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.680 
it that I say practice about like ten
times<00:02:22.620> each<00:02:23.490> from<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.000> side<00:02:24.210> side<00:02:24.450> left<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
times each from like side side left and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530 
times each from like side side left and
right<00:02:24.870> keys<00:02:25.020> don't<00:02:25.140> want<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.700> one-sided<00:02:26.700> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
right keys don't want to be one-sided it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.350 
right keys don't want to be one-sided it
would<00:02:27.690> help<00:02:28.190> prepare<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.640> were<00:02:29.790> both

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
would help prepare you if you were both

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
would help prepare you if you were both
sided<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.560> also<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:31.980> could<00:02:32.190> do<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.760> thing

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
sided and also you could do a thing

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.520 
sided and also you could do a thing
where<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.450> want<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> stick<00:02:33.990> if<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.200> can't<00:02:34.410> light

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
where I want a stick if you can't light

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.320 
where I want a stick if you can't light
it<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.710> right<00:02:34.890> away<00:02:34.980> everybody<00:02:35.850> takes<00:02:36.240> a

it like right away everybody takes a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.370 
it like right away everybody takes a
while<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> learn<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.990> just<00:02:37.110> had<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> get

while to learn it you just had to get

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.970 
while to learn it you just had to get
