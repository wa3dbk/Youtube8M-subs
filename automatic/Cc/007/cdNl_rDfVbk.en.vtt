here's<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> my<00:00:48.600> favorites<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> wild

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
here's one of my favorites the wild

here's one of my favorites the wild
Ripper<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.610> basically<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.120> an

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
Ripper and it's basically it's an

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
Ripper and it's basically it's an
all-terrain<00:00:51.660> tire<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> basically<00:00:52.739> do

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
all-terrain tire that can basically do

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.010 
all-terrain tire that can basically do
well<00:00:53.280> everywhere<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.390> extremely<00:00:54.840> fast

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
well everywhere it's extremely fast

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
well everywhere it's extremely fast
rolling<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.770> yet<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> touring

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
rolling but yet when you get to touring

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
rolling but yet when you get to touring
high<00:00:56.850> speeds<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.870> corner<00:00:58.350> bow<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
high speeds it can really corner bow and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.849 
high speeds it can really corner bow and
very<00:00:59.070> brakes<00:00:59.670> very<00:00:59.940> well<00:01:00.239> -<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.840> far<00:01:01.649> that's

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
very brakes very well - so far that's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
very brakes very well - so far that's
been<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.340> well<00:01:02.520> designed<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.239> of

actually<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> bigger<00:01:12.090> knob<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
actually a bigger knob you can see that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
actually a bigger knob you can see that
once<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.950> designed<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.700> than<00:01:14.909> enduro

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
once I designed for more than enduro

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
once I designed for more than enduro
racing<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.409> available<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> twenty

really big and beefy can withstand a lot
of<00:01:25.320> abuse<00:01:25.439> some<00:01:25.830> sharp<00:01:26.220> rocks

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of abuse some sharp rocks

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609

if<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.220> something<00:01:29.549> lighter<00:01:29.759> actually

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
if you want something lighter actually

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.929 
if you want something lighter actually
the<00:01:30.420> faster<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.590> non-reinforced<00:01:32.310> 225

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the faster that the non-reinforced 225

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
the faster that the non-reinforced 225
can<00:01:33.240> definitely<00:01:33.600> provide<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.259> grip<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
can definitely provide that grip and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
can definitely provide that grip and
traction<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.520> yet<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.329> lighter

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
traction but yet a little bit lighter

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.860 
traction but yet a little bit lighter
for<00:01:36.630> climbing<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.320> also

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
for climbing and also

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.280 
for climbing and also
a<00:01:37.900> lightweight<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.740> sense<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.900> 2.25<00:01:40.900> is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
a lightweight to sense the 2.25 is

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.440 
a lightweight to sense the 2.25 is
actually<00:01:41.620> been<00:01:41.800> uh<00:01:41.950> lat<00:01:42.160> smaller<00:01:42.460> knobs<00:01:42.820> is

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
actually been uh lat smaller knobs is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.170 
actually been uh lat smaller knobs is
Debbie<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.900> lighter<00:01:44.110> tire<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.890> also<00:01:45.310> providing

comes<00:01:50.140> in<00:01:50.290> an<00:01:50.410> advanced<00:01:50.950> series<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.970> non

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
comes in an advanced series and a non

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.270 
comes in an advanced series and a non
advanced<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:53.020> advanced<00:01:53.380> has<00:01:53.590> actually<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.040> gum

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
advanced the advanced has actually a gum

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.710 
advanced the advanced has actually a gum
x-series<00:01:54.730> compound<00:01:55.300> which<00:01:55.420> actually

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
x-series compound which actually

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.840 
x-series compound which actually
provides<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.380> softer<00:01:57.010> rubber<00:01:57.130> compound<00:01:57.730> a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
provides a softer rubber compound a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.180 
provides a softer rubber compound a
better<00:01:58.090> traction<00:01:58.480> better<00:01:58.780> grip<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.590> another

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
better traction better grip and another

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.010 
better traction better grip and another
advanced<00:02:00.520> actually<00:02:00.790> offers<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.300> little<00:02:01.870> bit

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
advanced actually offers a little bit

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.170 
advanced actually offers a little bit
more<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.350> longevity<00:02:02.560> shred<00:02:03.460> as<00:02:03.610> well<00:02:03.820> so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
more of a longevity shred as well so

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.720 
more of a longevity shred as well so
look<00:02:04.600> for<00:02:04.780> more<00:02:04.990> longevity<00:02:05.710> than<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.400> advanced

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
look for more longevity than on advanced

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.160 
look for more longevity than on advanced
if<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.060> want<00:02:07.270> some<00:02:07.420> more<00:02:07.570> performance

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
if you want some more performance

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.380 
if you want some more performance
stripping<00:02:08.590> there<00:02:09.250> gentle<00:02:09.610> higher<00:02:09.850> speed<00:02:10.210> and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
stripping there gentle higher speed and

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.200 
stripping there gentle higher speed and
therefore<00:02:10.840> better<00:02:11.140> grip<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.490> advance<00:02:12.820> tires

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
therefore better grip the advance tires

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.820 
therefore better grip the advance tires
which<00:02:13.600> you'd<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.850> Walker<00:02:15.850> advance
