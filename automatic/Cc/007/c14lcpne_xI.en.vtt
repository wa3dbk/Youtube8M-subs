ratchet strap I hate using it but I'm
going<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.120> show<00:00:13.240> you<00:00:13.300> how<00:00:13.540> to<00:00:13.600> use<00:00:13.780> it<00:00:13.990> so<00:00:14.740> let's

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
going to show you how to use it so let's

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.400 
going to show you how to use it so let's
pretend<00:00:16.029> that<00:00:16.299> we're<00:00:16.539> securing<00:00:17.020> some<00:00:17.199> lumber

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
pretend that we're securing some lumber

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.650 
pretend that we're securing some lumber
onto<00:00:17.860> this<00:00:17.980> trailer<00:00:18.370> so<00:00:19.150> while<00:00:19.390> it<00:00:19.480> may<00:00:19.600> seem

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
onto this trailer so while it may seem

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.779 
onto this trailer so while it may seem
obvious<00:00:20.050> one<00:00:20.860> of<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.010> ratchet<00:00:21.310> straps<00:00:21.550> gets

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
obvious one of the ratchet straps gets

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.160 
obvious one of the ratchet straps gets
hooked<00:00:21.970> onto<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.390> side<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:22.960> then<00:00:23.050> you'll

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
hooked onto that side and then you'll

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.359 
hooked onto that side and then you'll
take<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.350> other<00:00:23.560> one<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:23.980> you'll<00:00:24.100> hook<00:00:24.220> it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
take the other one and you'll hook it

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.859 
take the other one and you'll hook it
onto<00:00:24.520> this<00:00:24.700> side<00:00:24.970> and<00:00:25.240> you're<00:00:25.570> going<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.750> go

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
onto this side and you're going to go

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.960 
onto this side and you're going to go
ahead<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.289> you're<00:00:26.380> going<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.530> feed<00:00:26.800> this<00:00:27.130> long

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
ahead and you're going to feed this long

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.359 
ahead and you're going to feed this long
ratchet<00:00:28.630> all<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.770> way<00:00:29.860> through<00:00:30.160> this<00:00:30.310> thing

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
ratchet all the way through this thing

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.580 
ratchet all the way through this thing
and<00:00:30.789> I'll<00:00:31.150> show<00:00:31.330> you<00:00:31.390> how<00:00:31.539> to<00:00:31.600> do<00:00:31.690> that<00:00:31.869> next<00:00:31.990> so

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
and I'll show you how to do that next so

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.959 
and I'll show you how to do that next so
the<00:00:32.710> first<00:00:32.920> thing<00:00:33.039> about<00:00:33.190> this<00:00:33.309> ratchet<00:00:33.699> strap

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
the first thing about this ratchet strap

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.399 
the first thing about this ratchet strap
is<00:00:34.149> that<00:00:34.329> frequently<00:00:34.809> they're<00:00:35.050> very

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.409 
is that frequently they're very

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:36.840 
is that frequently they're very
difficult<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.949> move<00:00:36.129> so<00:00:36.309> make<00:00:36.519> sure<00:00:36.550> it's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
difficult to move so make sure it's

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.579 
difficult to move so make sure it's
lubricated<00:00:37.480> look<00:00:37.569> at<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.749> wd-40<00:00:38.469> or

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
lubricated look at the wd-40 or

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.290 
lubricated look at the wd-40 or
something<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.129> that<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.550> mechanisms<00:00:40.089> will

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
something so that the mechanisms will

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.509 
something so that the mechanisms will
move<00:00:40.510> smoothly<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.829> next<00:00:42.069> thing<00:00:42.190> you<00:00:42.280> want<00:00:42.460> to

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
move smoothly the next thing you want to

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.779 
move smoothly the next thing you want to
do<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:42.940> open<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:43.989> up<00:00:44.170> all<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.620> way<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.159> what

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
do is open this up all the way and what

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.590 
do is open this up all the way and what
you're<00:00:45.909> going<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.120> do<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.359> you're<00:00:46.449> going<00:00:46.539> to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.549 
you're going to do is you're going to
grab<00:00:46.929> here

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
grab here

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.340 
grab here
pull<00:00:48.069> and<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:49.149> moves<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:49.870> way<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.260> you're

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
pull and it moves this way and you're

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.340 
pull and it moves this way and you're
going<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.499> open<00:00:50.889> it<00:00:50.979> all<00:00:51.129> up<00:00:51.159> so<00:00:51.489> it's<00:00:51.729> reflect

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
going to open it all up so it's reflect

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.139 
going to open it all up so it's reflect
then<00:00:53.350> what<00:00:53.829> you'll<00:00:53.979> do<00:00:54.159> is<00:00:54.399> you'll<00:00:54.760> take<00:00:54.969> this

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
then what you'll do is you'll take this

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.410 
then what you'll do is you'll take this
strap<00:00:55.799> the<00:00:56.799> long<00:00:57.370> end<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.909> ratchet<00:00:58.239> strap

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
strap the long end of the ratchet strap

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.029 
strap the long end of the ratchet strap
that<00:00:58.539> doesn't<00:00:58.960> have<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.109> working<00:00:59.499> mechanism

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
that doesn't have a working mechanism

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.520 
that doesn't have a working mechanism
and<00:01:00.249> you're<00:01:00.670> going<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.969> feed<00:01:01.299> it<00:01:01.449> through<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
and you're going to feed it through so

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.560 
and you're going to feed it through so
here<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:02.889> can<00:01:02.979> see<00:01:03.190> I'm<00:01:03.459> able<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.180> feed<00:01:04.449> it

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
here you can see I'm able to feed it

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.639 
here you can see I'm able to feed it
through<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:06.939> way<00:01:07.390> however<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:08.530> you're

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
through like this way however if you're

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.230 
through like this way however if you're
not<00:01:08.829> able<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.340> you're<00:01:09.640> going<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.789> lift<00:01:10.030> this

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
not able to you're going to lift this

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.330 
not able to you're going to lift this
and<00:01:10.539> you're<00:01:11.049> going<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.200> move<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.829> mechanism

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
and you're going to move the mechanism

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.580 
and you're going to move the mechanism
it's<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.880> Pac<00:01:13.149> Man<00:01:13.180> should<00:01:13.869> be<00:01:13.990> facing<00:01:14.409> you

it's like a Pac Man should be facing you

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.920 
it's like a Pac Man should be facing you
so<00:01:14.799> that<00:01:15.369> it<00:01:15.939> comes<00:01:16.210> toward<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.810> so

don't pull it all the way through you're
going<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.549> be<00:01:30.640> ratcheting<00:01:31.179> over<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.049> over

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
going to be ratcheting over and over

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.219 
going to be ratcheting over and over
again<00:01:32.409> once<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.429> have<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.909> tight<00:01:34.359> then

again once you have this tight then
you're<00:01:35.469> just<00:01:35.649> going<00:01:35.859> to<00:01:36.070> take<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.369> handle

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
you're just going to take this handle

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.149 
you're just going to take this handle
you're<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.359> to<00:01:37.420> pull<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.719> down<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.320> you're

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159
