of<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.060> show<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.690> were<00:05:04.810> highly<00:05:05.050> issued<00:05:05.710> by

these two sets I think it's better to
buy<00:05:08.140> both<00:05:08.410> figures<00:05:08.830> instead<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.340> one<00:05:09.610> because

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
buy both figures instead of one because

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.380 
buy both figures instead of one because
