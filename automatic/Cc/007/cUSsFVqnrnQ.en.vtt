then look for words and we've done that
before<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.150> works<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:41.130> hopefully<00:03:42.130> that's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
before and it works so hopefully that's

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.239 
before and it works so hopefully that's
