00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.790
 Well, I'm still using the book 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.700
 Die-cut capital words up 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 four years and the four-year course 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 almost always towards the end with diarrhea 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
 that are mature change to this new 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.390
 material that would be the book tropel to of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.630
 the words in uppercase and lowercase 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.880
 that would be the same some cards 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.680
 vocabulary that has been cut in the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 lower part where the word comes in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.970
 uppercase and the upper part where 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.770
 comes in lowercase then well then 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.690
 it's about the same thing not looking for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.870
 age to an image how can it be 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.030
 is going to see where where can 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 put your hand in both capital letters and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.970
 lowercase then this one already has a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 greater complexity is one more material 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.230
 complex because it requires that the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.700
 children can read with their own 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.380
 strategies the word really is already 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.710
 well with the strategies that already 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.820
 knows or through the global reading a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.350
 more analytical or good seeing the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 length the sounds he has and others 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.939
 they already have them without any guidance 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.500
 look for the words then it's good 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.940
 because I'm just uses a game 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.610
 by teams d 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.080
 the afternoons and we put it several times 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.030
 during the course of the form because the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.760
 different team members can 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.010
 play in the afternoon they playing them and 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.540
 also this material just like the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.920
 earlier also sometimes I leave it in 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.870
 the corner of the library so that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.170
 can be used by children who go to 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.170
 this corner 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.100
 Well, the following material would be 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.810
 the cards with words and the tweezers 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.430
 both in schools and in lowercase and 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.700
 is a material that he used then to 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.500
 favor the development of the analysis of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.150
 both graphic and phonological language 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.070
 this is the material consists therefore for a 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.860
 side of vocabulary cards that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.740
 they can be uppercase or lowercase 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.230
 in three always with the image behind 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.910
 and ahead with the name that can 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.800
 be equal in lowercase or upper case 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.450
 that I have here is in lowercase and 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.170
 then already in five then used only 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.300
 the word without the picture behind bad and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.170
 well then cut the pincha rapier 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.320
 tend the clothes they have then letters 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.320
 capital letters 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.310
 or lowercase letters in three years because it 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.859
 he used the pieces with capital letters 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.750
 and good then what is to choose 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.950
 the words in three years obviously not 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.680
 we are going to sell because they choose what 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.390
 they want to write for example soup 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.389
 Well look at the word and it is taking 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.099
 the tweezers and put them in a 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.870
 garlic start in misplaced but then 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.250
 they are already shrinking the directionality and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.349
 they start at the beginning until 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.469
 they fill in the whole word then 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.290
 they have that for this one this good game 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.120
 well, it makes them aware of the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.799
 units that have a word of yes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.900
 the long words have many tweezers 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.329
 does not have a few, they are also fixing 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.760
 in what has each word itself has 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.500
 the one that I know her for example and then 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.060
 Well, how do we make a game of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.969
 teams in the evenings are played in 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.349
 small group as it favors favors 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.000
 much that they talk about the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.859
 language what is very positive because 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.889
 You compare and my word has more 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:12.260
 letters or more more clips than yours if 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.909
 has mine has yours today not if it is 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.889
 I need a judge who has them 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.750
 in your word then good for this 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.360
 It is also very good because they speak in a 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.670
 very similar that connects more between them 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.670
 and favors more learning 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.600
 Well, when you are able to 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.150
 three years to recognize his name and that of 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.400
 Some colleague then took out this material 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.740
 which consists of communes towards 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.230
 grills with photos of children's 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.450
 the class is good because it is a folio like 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.250
 you see grid where stuck by 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.800
 photos of girls when ahead 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.510
 like from behind then well it is 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.940
 totally a multi drill sleeve that 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.010
 has some remaining centers stuck 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.420
 under the photo / it is simply 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.480
 every year choose a good grill now 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.010
 They are also numbered to facilitate 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.720
 because then we keep the material 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.920
 that are from grill 3 with names 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.570
 which are going to correspond is worth then 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.550
 here they have the names that go to 12 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.230
 names of this grill and well what 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.390
 what it's about is that they go matching 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.910
 to the oven then watching to see who is each 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.100
 one of the children recognizing his name 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.040
 and they are placing it then not good 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.630
 Well, I usually give a religion 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.880
 they the one they like the most according to where 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.440
 be your friend and others and washing filling 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.459
 and then later I'll have it 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.710
 teaching 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.500
 fill in the front part and fill it 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.389
 the part 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.430
 behind 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.110
 and well, this material I use 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.669
 also in play by teams of by the 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.650
 afternoon walk every day of the week you 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.870
 touch one of the teams and I have good 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.909
 then several several of these so that 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.289
 have each child also numbered and 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.539
 within each one, I would go to the 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.129
 names that correspond with that with that 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.900
 grill is not there so well can they 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.080
 play several at once and exchange 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.279
 the and others and well then nothing until here 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.669
