00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello everyone welcome on kitchen 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.510
 quick 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.900
 today we are going to make soup to 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.790
 Onion au gratin in the kitchen is gone 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.560
 for our onion gratin will we 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.100
 have 6 onions that I cut in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.939
 cubes 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 a liter of water a little pepper 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 a teaspoon of sugar semolina a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.539
 tablespoon flour 2 tablespoons 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 oil soup with two cubes of broth 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.920
 bio there I took cubes of vegetables 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.340
 you can also take 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.309
 beef or chicken broth 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
 grated cheese so g 100 g and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.000
 croutons this is the baguette that I have 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.899
 cut in bias and it will take me 200 g 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 so here I am going to show you how 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.559
 I cut my onions cub3 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 the emotion of cutting in half then you 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:08.790
 cut it that way that's it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.790
 then we will get him back to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.189
 the inside with the knife to have 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.090
 in fact what to make cubes and there we 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.090
 will cut into cubes 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.259
 so here I am going to do the second 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.049
 also then the faculty give 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.650
 the impression that there is a lot but in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.259
 does that go back down with cooking so 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.320
 that's going to make funny or vegetation and 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:43.530
 we will end up with a quantity 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.970
 less watt so here I want 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.100
 the being void word so it's him 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.470
 neutral it 's sunflower oil to 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.159
 could put peanut oil 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.060
 those who want to put oil from 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.700
 books it works too 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.380
 so we let them warm up moon and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.380
 so we put our onions 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.200
 the time that my caramelized onions 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.390
 I 'm going to put the cubes of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 broth in warm water and there I you 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.160
 I missed mixing and booking two 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.160
 sides 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.510
 the presence of laurent added so our 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.159
 sugar it's going to help caramelize 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.260
 for your onion soup then you 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.030
 rectified at the last moment to see 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.450
 whether salt is needed or not knowing that the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.720
 broth and already knew so better 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.319
 not too much to start with, so here we go 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.319
 let caramelize 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.349
 so if you want the coloring 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.640
 much faster and you'll just 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.500
 buy butter but I just 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.150
 to leave me their prefer to take the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.250
 time it takes 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.629
 the goal is to take off the juices that are 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.989
 find no the pan to have a 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.379
 maximum color and taste photo 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.510
 horn that the pan and almost 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:18.159
 dry we add a little bit finally in 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.909
 ice cream at work here and there I 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.909
 shell or mix 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.700
 so now I'm going to put my 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.440
 flour then the flour will serve me 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.740
 read in celebration 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:39.590
 vam slightly thicken my soup here 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:42.890
 to have more texture there I go 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.320
 so everyone lyon and I'm going 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.990
 continue cooking for about 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.100
 15 minutes so my soup to spin the leather 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.690
 so if you wish you can at 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.550
 starting then there is bay thyme 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.440
 I think with the broth of 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.030
 vegetables that's enough so in fact actually 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.770
 for those who want a more color 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.230
 pronounced then it will have to be added 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.490
 be more fat for more 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.520
 caramelized in that your onions 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.930
 here is the master of beef broth 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.919
 also brings a pretty color 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:25.720
 brunin so there I take a bowl so to 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.720
 sugar onion I'm going to their empire 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.780
 but while the soup was in the process 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.090
 to finish the cook I put shots 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.580
 time to bake a hot oven that 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.919
 I turned off and I dropped but 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.280
 slices of bread on it and she have 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.470
