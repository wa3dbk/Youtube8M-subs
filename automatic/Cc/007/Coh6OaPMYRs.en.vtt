00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.680 
caliper just the rotor in which it
knocks<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.830> every<00:03:24.220> time<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.790> pass<00:03:25.420> one

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
knocks is that every time you pass one

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.750 
knocks is that every time you pass one
of<00:03:25.840> those<00:03:26.010> waves<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.130> see<00:03:27.160> there<00:03:27.550> on<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
of those waves you see there on the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.350 
of those waves you see there on the
outside<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.330> feel<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> knocking<00:03:29.019> noise<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:30.360> you

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
outside you feel a knocking noise so you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.120 
outside you feel a knocking noise so you
really<00:03:31.600> do<00:03:31.870> feel<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.200> on<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.380> front<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:32.890> what

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
really do feel it on the front so what

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.979 
really do feel it on the front so what
I've<00:03:33.280> done<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.610> I've<00:03:33.730> put<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.970> Shimano<00:03:34.360> rotor<00:03:34.720> on

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
I've done is I've put a Shimano rotor on

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.320 
I've done is I've put a Shimano rotor on
their<00:03:35.200> cost<00:03:35.980> me<00:03:36.100> about<00:03:36.280> 25<00:03:36.610> pounds<00:03:37.090> really

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
their cost me about 25 pounds really

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.240 
their cost me about 25 pounds really
nice<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.840> really<00:03:37.900> smooth<00:03:38.320> rotor<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.980> you

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
nice and really smooth rotor and you

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.000 
nice and really smooth rotor and you
know<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.400> could<00:03:39.610> stop<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.030> 50<00:03:40.450> B<00:03:40.600> if<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.930> if<00:03:41.830> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
know I could stop on a 50 B if you if I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.680 
know I could stop on a 50 B if you if I
really<00:03:42.310> needed<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.670> on<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.060> row<00:03:43.239> time

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
really needed to on that row time

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.890 
really needed to on that row time
that's<00:03:44.470> 180<00:03:45.010> rotor<00:03:45.340> will<00:03:46.300> be<00:03:46.420> changing<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
that's 180 rotor will be changing the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.790 
that's 180 rotor will be changing the
back<00:03:47.080> rotor<00:03:47.519> that's<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.640> 160<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.450> there<00:03:49.800> we'll

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
back rotor that's a 160 on there we'll

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.070 
back rotor that's a 160 on there we'll
be<00:03:50.830> changing<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.550> one<00:03:51.670> very<00:03:51.880> shortly<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.720> as

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
be changing that one very shortly but as

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.960 
be changing that one very shortly but as
I<00:03:53.230> don't<00:03:53.290> use<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.709> back<00:03:53.860> brake<00:03:54.130> it's<00:03:54.700> often

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
I don't use the back brake it's often

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.670 
I don't use the back brake it's often
was<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.209> front<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:56.080> bearable<00:03:56.410> at<00:03:56.620> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
was the front it's it's bearable at the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.250 
was the front it's it's bearable at the
moment<00:03:59.550> very<00:04:00.550> fast<00:04:00.940> bike<00:04:01.239> very<00:04:01.989> lightweight

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
moment very fast bike very lightweight

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.900 
moment very fast bike very lightweight
and<00:04:02.820> definitely<00:04:03.820> would<00:04:04.030> recommend<00:04:05.670> all<00:04:06.670> in

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
and definitely would recommend all in

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.400 
and definitely would recommend all in
all<00:04:07.030> very<00:04:07.269> nice<00:04:07.930> bike<00:04:08.260> thank<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.100> very<00:04:09.250> much
