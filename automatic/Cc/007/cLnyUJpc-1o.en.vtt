the<00:00:08.309> first<00:00:08.550> thing<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.120> think<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.450> when<00:00:09.990> we

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the first thing we think about when we

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.220 
the first thing we think about when we
talk<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.559> people<00:00:10.710> about<00:00:10.920> their<00:00:11.280> injuries<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
talk to people about their injuries is

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.959 
talk to people about their injuries is
they've<00:00:13.230> they've<00:00:13.590> done<00:00:13.830> too<00:00:14.070> much<00:00:14.309> too<00:00:14.670> fast

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
they've they've done too much too fast

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.170 
they've they've done too much too fast
they've<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.900> they've<00:00:16.109> run<00:00:16.289> too<00:00:16.500> far<00:00:17.180> when

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
they've got they've run too far when

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.179 
they've got they've run too far when
they<00:00:18.210> weren't<00:00:18.480> ready<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.050> they've<00:00:19.590> run

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
they weren't ready for that they've run

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
they weren't ready for that they've run
with<00:00:20.369> too<00:00:20.490> much<00:00:20.640> speed<00:00:20.910> when<00:00:21.750> they're<00:00:21.900> not

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
with too much speed when they're not

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.400 
with too much speed when they're not
ready<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.600> not<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:25.170> listening

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
ready for that so not really listening

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.429 
ready for that so not really listening
to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> body<00:00:26.570> whether<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.840> speed<00:00:28.199> or

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
to the body whether it's speed or

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.370 
to the body whether it's speed or
distance<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.189> Hill<00:00:29.699> training<00:00:30.109> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> the

distance or Hill training going to the
track<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.980> thinking<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> did<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
track and thinking you know you did a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
track and thinking you know you did a
six<00:00:33.420> minute<00:00:33.570> pace<00:00:33.899> last<00:00:34.230> year<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> go<00:00:35.340> out

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
six minute pace last year and you go out

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
six minute pace last year and you go out
and<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> six<00:00:36.000> minute<00:00:36.180> pace<00:00:36.480> mile<00:00:36.780> mile

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and do a six minute pace mile mile

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
and do a six minute pace mile mile
repeats<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:38.010> year<00:00:38.340> you're<00:00:38.790> probably<00:00:38.969> gonna

repeats this year you're probably gonna

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.150 
repeats this year you're probably gonna
walk<00:00:39.420> away<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:40.020> night<00:00:40.290> injured<00:00:42.920> 10%<00:00:43.920> rule

walk away that night injured 10% rule
really<00:00:44.399> applies<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.260> everything<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.530> with

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
really applies to everything you do with

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
really applies to everything you do with
an<00:00:46.800> increase<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.460> that's<00:00:47.579> intensity<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
an increase and that's intensity and

everything<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:54.329> increasing

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
everything that you do on an increasing

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.250 
everything that you do on an increasing
basis<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.399> apply<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
basis if you apply that to all the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
basis if you apply that to all the
elements<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.829> running<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.309> helps<00:01:00.239> prevent

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
elements of running it helps prevent

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
elements of running it helps prevent
injury<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.530> let's<00:01:01.739> say<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.010> you're<00:01:02.160> running

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
injury so let's say if you're running

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.899 
injury so let's say if you're running
your<00:01:02.760> longest<00:01:03.329> run<00:01:03.600> last<00:01:04.589> week<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.189> 10<00:01:05.580> miles

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
your longest run last week was 10 miles

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.380 
your longest run last week was 10 miles
and<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.750> training<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.290> marathon<00:01:08.390> next

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and you're training for a marathon next

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
and you're training for a marathon next
weekend<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.960> better<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.500> doing<00:01:10.680> 16

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
weekend you better not be doing 16

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
weekend you better not be doing 16
that's<00:01:11.640> too<00:01:11.880> big<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> jump<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:13.200> next

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that's too big of a jump your next

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.010 
that's too big of a jump your next
longest<00:01:14.460> run<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.939> 11<00:01:15.390> miles<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
longest run would be 11 miles so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.920 
longest run would be 11 miles so
increasing<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.009> distance<00:01:17.460> by<00:01:17.640> 10%<00:01:18.420> per<00:01:18.630> week

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
increasing your distance by 10% per week

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.499 
increasing your distance by 10% per week
is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> safe<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.119> even<00:01:21.270> if

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
is a safe way to do that and even if

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
is a safe way to do that and even if
you're<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> walker<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.590> getting<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you're a walker and you're getting a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
you're a walker and you're getting a
physical<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.820> fitness<00:01:24.090> program<00:01:24.600> going

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
physical you know fitness program going

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.109 
physical you know fitness program going
or<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.920> casual<00:01:26.400> runner<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
or your casual runner and you want to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.899 
or your casual runner and you want to
bump<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> next<00:01:27.869> level<00:01:28.430> don't<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.670> too

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
bump up to the next level don't do too

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.319 
bump up to the next level don't do too
much<00:01:30.060> too<00:01:30.360> fast<00:01:31.490> something<00:01:32.490> else<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.030> helps

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
much too fast something else that helps

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090 
much too fast something else that helps
is<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.049> call<00:01:34.200> periodization<00:01:34.770> which

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
is what they call periodization which

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.359 
is what they call periodization which
allows<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.240> recover<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> periodization

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
allows you to recover and periodization

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
allows you to recover and periodization
gives<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> recovery<00:01:39.390> building<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> recovery

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
gives you a recovery building a recovery

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.800 
gives you a recovery building a recovery
to<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.770> training<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.970> cyclic<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:42.540> form

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to your training in a cyclic or form

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.460 
to your training in a cyclic or form
it's<00:01:43.530> convenient<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.220> use<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> month<00:01:44.670> cycle<00:01:45.470> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it's convenient to use a month cycle so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.310 
it's convenient to use a month cycle so
if<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.100> every<00:01:47.610> fourth<00:01:48.030> week<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
if you have every fourth week is a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.370 
if you have every fourth week is a
slightly<00:01:50.040> reduced<00:01:50.640> week<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.630> allows<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
slightly reduced week it allows you to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.880 
slightly reduced week it allows you to
increase<00:01:52.680> faster<00:01:53.369> overall<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.890> prevent

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
increase faster overall and prevent

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.800 
increase faster overall and prevent
injury<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.310> allow<00:01:56.670> recovery<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.780> know

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
injury and allow recovery you know

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
injury and allow recovery you know
that's<00:01:58.079> true<00:01:58.380> recovery<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.610> often

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that's true recovery is really often

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.139 
that's true recovery is really often
overlooked<00:02:00.659> by<00:02:01.259> runners<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.310> triathletes<00:02:02.369> as

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
overlooked by runners and triathletes as

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.389 
overlooked by runners and triathletes as
well<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.170> volume<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> best<00:02:05.159> thing

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
well you think volume is the best thing

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.999 
well you think volume is the best thing
to<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> good<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to go for this is a good time to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.520 
to go for this is a good time to
incorporate<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:08.970> flexibility<00:02:09.750> understand

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
incorporate your flexibility understand

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.800 
incorporate your flexibility understand
and<00:02:10.800> listen<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.310> body<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.420> did<00:02:12.780> a

heavy workout on Sunday then you really

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.770 
heavy workout on Sunday then you really
shouldn't<00:02:17.550> back<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.970> up<00:02:18.090> with<00:02:18.240> another<00:02:18.360> heavy

quite natural and we can overcome the

quite natural and we can overcome the

often leads to injury what do you think
that<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.560> right<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.220> think<00:03:14.750> we're<00:03:15.750> talking

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
that is right I think we're talking

that is right I think we're talking
about<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.890> many<00:03:17.190> things<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.670> occur<00:03:18.110> when<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
about so many things that occur when you

that's<00:03:26.519> only<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:27.090> component<00:03:27.680> other

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680

if you're a supinator if your feet are

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.530 
if you're a supinator if your feet are
neutral<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:38.370> if<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.550> have<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.700> high<00:03:38.910> arch<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.330> low

proper running form or not you really

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.390 
proper running form or not you really
need<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.170> understand<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.799> balance<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.280> your

runners<00:04:16.140> today<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.890> we<00:04:17.280> don't<00:04:17.489> tend<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.880> get

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
runners today is we don't tend to get

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.900 
runners today is we don't tend to get
into<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.720> flexed<00:04:19.290> athletic<00:04:20.250> position<00:04:20.430> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
into that flexed athletic position and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.050 
into that flexed athletic position and
that's<00:04:21.060> what<00:04:21.330> really<00:04:21.539> proven

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
that's what really proven

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.360 
that's what really proven

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
billed as a spring and if we use it like

billed as a spring and if we use it like
a<00:04:26.710> spring<00:04:26.950> then<00:04:27.310> we<00:04:27.400> typically<00:04:27.760> won't<00:04:28.090> get

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
a spring then we typically won't get

you'll<00:04:41.320> notice<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.980> touch<00:04:42.220> very

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
you'll notice that you touch very

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.360 
you'll notice that you touch very
lightly<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.810> land<00:04:44.139> very<00:04:44.410> lightly<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.100> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
lightly you land very lightly and you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.310 
lightly you land very lightly and you
just<00:04:45.610> simply<00:04:46.000> lift<00:04:46.180> your<00:04:46.419> knee<00:04:46.600> instead<00:04:47.200> of

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
just simply lift your knee instead of

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.159 
just simply lift your knee instead of
pushing<00:04:47.710> off<00:04:47.860> at<00:04:48.040> fourth<00:04:48.340> by<00:04:49.240> landing<00:04:49.780> lightly

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
pushing off at fourth by landing lightly

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.530 
pushing off at fourth by landing lightly
and<00:04:50.320> sensing<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.889> ground<00:04:51.160> you'll<00:04:52.090> you'll

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
and sensing the ground you'll you'll

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.330 
and sensing the ground you'll you'll
just<00:04:52.780> automatically<00:04:53.500> run<00:04:53.830> with<00:04:54.040> a<00:04:54.070> better

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
just automatically run with a better

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.909 
just automatically run with a better
overall<00:04:54.820> body<00:04:55.060> form<00:04:55.479> so<00:04:56.050> number<00:04:56.410> one<00:04:56.590> let's

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
overall body form so number one let's

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.070 
overall body form so number one let's
really<00:04:57.190> try<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.460> focus<00:04:57.790> on<00:04:58.300> what<00:04:58.630> natural

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
really try to focus on what natural

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.600 
really try to focus on what natural
running<00:04:59.290> is<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:00.330> exclude<00:05:01.330> all<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.930> other

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
running is and exclude all the other

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.070 
running is and exclude all the other
exterior<00:05:03.610> forces<00:05:03.940> like<00:05:04.360> how<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.690> shoe

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
exterior forces like how a shoe

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.260 
exterior forces like how a shoe
influences<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.220> need<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.700> think<00:05:07.090> about

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
influences you you need to think about

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.060 
influences you you need to think about
how<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.690> should<00:05:08.229> run<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.770> move<00:05:08.950> yourself

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
how you should run and move yourself

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.760 
how you should run and move yourself
across<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.880> ground<00:05:10.090> properly<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.840> run<00:05:11.530> with

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
across the ground properly and run with

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.379 
across the ground properly and run with
proper<00:05:12.130> running<00:05:12.310> form<00:05:12.490> as<00:05:12.910> if<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.270> were

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
proper running form as if you were

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.409 
proper running form as if you were
barefoot<00:05:13.690> so<00:05:14.350> landing<00:05:14.800> lightly<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:16.150> touch

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
barefoot so landing lightly you touch

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.090 
barefoot so landing lightly you touch
the<00:05:16.630> ground<00:05:16.780> like<00:05:17.139> you're<00:05:17.290> on<00:05:17.410> hot<00:05:17.620> coals<00:05:17.650> so

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
the ground like you're on hot coals so

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.330 
the ground like you're on hot coals so
you<00:05:18.310> basically<00:05:18.870> touch<00:05:19.870> lightly<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.620> lift<00:05:21.070> and

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
you basically touch lightly and lift and

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.670 
you basically touch lightly and lift and
move<00:05:21.880> forward<00:05:22.690> with<00:05:22.810> gravity<00:05:23.290> looking

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
move forward with gravity looking

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.490 
move forward with gravity looking
forward<00:05:23.979> leaning<00:05:24.550> forward<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.930> know<00:05:26.050> use<00:05:26.470> the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
forward leaning forward you know use the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.740 
forward leaning forward you know use the
natural<00:05:26.950> running<00:05:27.370> technique<00:05:27.729> to<00:05:28.180> influence

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
natural running technique to influence

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.580 
natural running technique to influence
injury<00:05:29.350> prevention<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.070> speed
