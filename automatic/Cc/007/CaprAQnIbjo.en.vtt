okay and now it's ready to pour up and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.879 
okay and now it's ready to pour up and
normally<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.389> would<00:03:18.659> make<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.199> a<00:03:19.290> 20-pound

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
normally I would make this in a 20-pound

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.640 
normally I would make this in a 20-pound
batch<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.729> I<00:03:20.879> would<00:03:21.060> pour<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:21.629> know<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.229> a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
batch and I would pour it you know in a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.369 
batch and I would pour it you know in a
big<00:03:22.919> tub<00:03:23.699> oh<00:03:24.060> good<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.349> for<00:03:25.739> purposes<00:03:27.379> small

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
big tub oh good but for purposes small

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.699 
big tub oh good but for purposes small
making<00:03:29.540> we're<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.049> pour<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.409> up<00:03:31.500> in

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
making we're just going to pour it up in

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.620 
making we're just going to pour it up in
here<00:03:31.739> okay

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.050 

then<00:03:37.470> once<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.310> port<00:03:38.670> up<00:03:38.850> like

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
then once you have this port up like

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.120 
then once you have this port up like
that<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:40.980> let<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.520> sit<00:03:41.850> for<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.920> to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
that then you let it sit for I like to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.700 
that then you let it sit for I like to
let<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.400> sit<00:03:44.640> for<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:45.330> know<00:03:45.450> 24<00:03:45.990> hours<00:03:46.440> in

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
let it sit for you know 24 hours in

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.280 
let it sit for you know 24 hours in
these<00:03:47.700> molds<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.300> mean<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.750> were<00:03:48.930> pouring

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
these molds but I mean if I were pouring

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.380 
these molds but I mean if I were pouring
in<00:03:49.440> 20<00:03:49.800> pound<00:03:50.010> batches<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.700> would<00:03:50.880> just<00:03:51.060> put<00:03:51.270> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
in 20 pound batches I would just put the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.660 
in 20 pound batches I would just put the
bucket<00:03:51.540> away<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.200> then<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.740> just<00:03:52.770> hardens<00:03:53.460> and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
bucket away and then it just hardens and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.210 
bucket away and then it just hardens and
I<00:03:53.820> let<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.150> cure<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.860> six<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.040> eight<00:03:56.070> weeks

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
I let it cure for six to eight weeks

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.270 
I let it cure for six to eight weeks
minimum<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:58.730> then<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.840> result<00:04:01.560> okay

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
minimum and then this is the result okay

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.980 
minimum and then this is the result okay
so<00:04:02.580> basically<00:04:02.730> what<00:04:03.240> you're<00:04:03.270> just<00:04:03.570> made<00:04:03.750> over

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
so basically what you're just made over

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.440 
so basically what you're just made over
here<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.410> going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.770> be<00:04:05.010> your<00:04:05.250> base<00:04:05.550> yes<00:04:06.060> this

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
here is going to be your base yes this

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.660 
here is going to be your base yes this
is<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.750> face<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:07.350> this<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.710> nice<00:04:08.040> isn't<00:04:08.400> your

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
is a face so this is a nice isn't your

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.820 
is a face so this is a nice isn't your
finished<00:04:08.970> product<00:04:09.210> no<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.080> not<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.650> is

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
finished product no it is not this is

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.870 
finished product no it is not this is
the<00:04:10.980> first<00:04:11.250> stage<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:12.150> my<00:04:12.480> product<00:04:12.990> okay<00:04:13.440> and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
the first stage of my product okay and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.940 
the first stage of my product okay and
what<00:04:14.880> I've<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.060> done<00:04:15.570> right<00:04:15.900> there<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.470> what

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
what I've just done right there is what

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:25.280 
what I've just done right there is what
this<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.520> equivalent<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:24.140> well<00:04:25.140> don't

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
this the equivalent of this well don't

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.680 
this the equivalent of this well don't
worry<00:04:25.710> about<00:04:25.920> it's<00:04:26.100> all<00:04:26.220> wrapped<00:04:26.430> up<00:04:26.610> good<00:04:26.880> but

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
worry about it's all wrapped up good but

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.510 
worry about it's all wrapped up good but
that's<00:04:27.930> that's<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.590> base<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.130> make<00:04:29.310> out

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
that's that's the base that you make out

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.670 
that's that's the base that you make out
