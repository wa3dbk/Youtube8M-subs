00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.710 

I'm<00:00:00.390> a<00:00:00.510> plaque<00:00:00.780> in<00:00:00.810> 2007<00:00:02.270> it's<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.389> video<00:00:03.629> that

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
I'm a plaque in 2007 it's a video that

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.909 
I'm a plaque in 2007 it's a video that
is<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:05.130> six<00:00:05.640> minutes<00:00:05.850> long<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:07.020> wanted

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
is about six minutes long and I wanted

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.530 
is about six minutes long and I wanted
to<00:00:07.980> confirm<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> legacy<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.940> Glenn<00:00:09.240> Gould

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
to confirm the legacy of Glenn Gould

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.690 
to confirm the legacy of Glenn Gould
what<00:00:10.080> he<00:00:10.290> represents<00:00:10.830> today<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> monument

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
what he represents today as a monument

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.259 
what he represents today as a monument
to<00:00:12.440> something<00:00:13.440> more<00:00:13.650> superfluous<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> more

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to something more superfluous and more

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.660 
to something more superfluous and more
in<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.630> background<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.949> set<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.490> which

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
in the background of the set on which

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.590 
in the background of the set on which
she's<00:00:17.940> playing<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> piano

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.830 

and<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:21.320> I<00:00:21.350> cast<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:22.130> slab<00:00:22.460> of<00:00:22.490> concrete<00:00:22.730> in<00:00:23.660> the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
and so I cast a slab of concrete in the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.510 
and so I cast a slab of concrete in the
same<00:00:23.990> dimensions<00:00:24.529> as<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:24.800> deco<00:00:25.160> element

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
same dimensions as the deco element

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.320 
same dimensions as the deco element
again<00:00:26.000> good<00:00:26.240> set<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.099> camera<00:00:28.910> is<00:00:29.119> like

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
again good set and so the camera is like

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.950 
again good set and so the camera is like
switching<00:00:29.750> from<00:00:30.020> from<00:00:30.619> these<00:00:30.770> to<00:00:31.039> Manolete

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
switching from from these to Manolete

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.200 
switching from from these to Manolete
constructions<00:00:33.070> one<00:00:34.070> from<00:00:34.370> one<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.670> other

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
constructions one from one to the other

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.270 
constructions one from one to the other
I<00:00:37.239> think<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.629> gaze<00:00:39.379> when<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.070> work

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
I think the the the gaze when you work

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.990 
I think the the the gaze when you work
with<00:00:40.780> subjectivity<00:00:41.780> as<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.680> as<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.790> eye<00:00:43.970> of

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
with subjectivity as the as the eye of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.950 
with subjectivity as the as the eye of
the<00:00:44.510> camera

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the camera

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.189 
the camera
that<00:00:45.320> becomes<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:46.040> eye<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.460> viewer<00:00:47.199> and

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
that becomes the eye of the viewer and

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.290 
that becomes the eye of the viewer and
when<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:48.650> enter<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.070> detail<00:00:49.430> in<00:00:49.640> most<00:00:49.879> almost

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
when you enter the detail in most almost

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.040 
when you enter the detail in most almost
like<00:00:50.480> very<00:00:51.379> very<00:00:51.470> close<00:00:52.010> offs<00:00:52.280> then<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.090> you

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
like very very close offs then you you

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.380 
like very very close offs then you you
can<00:00:54.230> transform<00:00:55.129> this<00:00:55.340> camera<00:00:55.610> into<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.090> very

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
can transform this camera into a very

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.170 
can transform this camera into a very
interesting<00:00:56.660> critical<00:00:57.350> eye<00:00:57.649> that's<00:00:58.610> like<00:00:59.000> an

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
interesting critical eye that's like an

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.450 
interesting critical eye that's like an
interest<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.600> use

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.420 

the<00:01:06.910> bench<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.270> called<00:01:07.540> drag<00:01:07.810> bench<00:01:08.080> is<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.920> copy

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
the bench is called drag bench is a copy

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.660 
the bench is called drag bench is a copy
of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> normal<00:01:10.090> bench<00:01:10.300> but<00:01:10.600> made<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.930> plaster

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of the normal bench but made of plaster

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.360 
of the normal bench but made of plaster
you<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:12.850> still<00:01:13.150> sit<00:01:13.420> on<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.720> but<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:15.100> like

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
you can still sit on it but it's like

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.430 
you can still sit on it but it's like
the<00:01:15.670> poor<00:01:15.940> material<00:01:16.510> trying<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.930> imitate<00:01:17.140> the

the poor material trying to imitate the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.880 
the poor material trying to imitate the
noble<00:01:17.860> material<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.570> benches<00:01:23.050> are<00:01:23.440> also

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
noble material the benches are also

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.480

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
that always placed on top of them and so

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.650 
that always placed on top of them and so
as<00:01:30.460> if<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.700> were<00:01:30.820> if<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:30.970> sit<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.510> bench

as if you were if you sit on the bench

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.480 
as if you were if you sit on the bench
you're<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.380> sitting<00:01:32.740> next<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.130> an<00:01:33.250> artwork

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
didn't say this this playfulness this

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.660 
didn't say this this playfulness this
object<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.290> longing<00:01:50.650> for<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.340> know<00:01:51.460> some

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.930 

the<00:01:56.740> three<00:01:56.920> photographs<00:01:57.400> are<00:01:57.670> like

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
the three photographs are like

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.270 
the three photographs are like
photographic<00:01:58.750> reproductions<00:01:59.410> of<00:01:59.740> sculptures

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280

that I did from it was important not to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.700 
that I did from it was important not to
have<00:02:03.070> only<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:04.300> work<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.870> sculpture<00:02:05.530> the
