nine<00:01:26.970> dollars<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.330> year<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:28.229> i<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.860> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
nine dollars a year which i think is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.730 
nine dollars a year which i think is
really<00:01:29.310> good<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:29.820> typically<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.710> $79<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
really good because typically it's $79 a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
really good because typically it's $79 a
year<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> flipper<00:01:32.970> --xe

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
year to get all the flipper --xe

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580 
year to get all the flipper --xe
but<00:01:33.540> you'd<00:01:33.659> only<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> pay<00:01:34.140> thirty<00:01:34.350> nine

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
but you'd only have to pay thirty nine

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.899 
but you'd only have to pay thirty nine
dollars<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> year<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> student

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
dollars a year because you're a student

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
dollars a year because you're a student
and<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.689> would<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.960> able<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> price

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and you would be able to get that price

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
and you would be able to get that price
for<00:01:38.159> four<00:01:38.430> years<00:01:38.790> ultimately<00:01:39.479> you're<00:01:39.630> gonna

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
for four years ultimately you're gonna
