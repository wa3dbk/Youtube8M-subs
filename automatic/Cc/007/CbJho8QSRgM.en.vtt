chains and Spears and the cool thing
about<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.400> peg<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.799> with

about these is you just peg them in with
the<00:01:16.950> hands<00:01:17.840> I'm<00:01:18.840> assuming<00:01:19.229> that'll<00:01:19.530> work

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the hands I'm assuming that'll work

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
the hands I'm assuming that'll work
because<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.729> how<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> looks<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.330> it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because that's how it looks like it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.760 
because that's how it looks like it's
supposed<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> work<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> can't<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.560> get

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
supposed to work but I can't really get

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.920 
supposed to work but I can't really get
it<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.189> now

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
it in right now

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
it in right now
and<00:01:25.400> well<00:01:26.400> I'll<00:01:26.520> play<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and well I'll play around with that and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.370 
and well I'll play around with that and
I'll<00:01:27.360> try<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> photos<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
I'll try to do it for the photos at the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'll try to do it for the photos at the
end<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.770> looks<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.340> supposed<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
end but it looks like it's supposed to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.069 
end but it looks like it's supposed to
go<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.570> there's<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:30.990> no

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

directions<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.950> figure<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.090> can

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
directions with the figure but you can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
directions with the figure but you can
imagine<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:34.020> work<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> I'll<00:01:34.409> try

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
imagine how that would work and I'll try

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
imagine how that would work and I'll try
to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> done<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> photos<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:36.030> you

they're<00:01:46.170> shading<00:01:46.409> throughout<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
they're shading throughout all of the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940 
they're shading throughout all of the
pants<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> uniform<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> top<00:01:49.590> part

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
pants in the uniform in the top part

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
pants in the uniform in the top part
there's<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.490> no<00:01:50.700> paintwork<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
there's just no paintwork really on the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
there's just no paintwork really on the
skin<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.920> everything<00:01:53.250> else<00:01:53.369> looks<00:01:53.490> pretty

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
skin but everything else looks pretty

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.359 
skin but everything else looks pretty
good<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.590> did<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> hood<00:01:56.100> so

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
good I like the way they did the hood so

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.499 
good I like the way they did the hood so
that<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.579> could<00:01:56.700> move<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> head<00:01:57.090> around<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that you could move the head around and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
that you could move the head around and
still<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> hood<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.439> feels<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.950> maybe

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
still have the hood it feels like maybe

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.530 
still have the hood it feels like maybe
it<00:01:59.340> should<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.549> been<00:01:59.670> glued<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> little

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it should have been glued on a little

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.940 
it should have been glued on a little
bit<00:02:00.659> farther<00:02:00.869> forward<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.619> that's<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
bit farther forward but that's not a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
bit farther forward but that's not a
huge<00:02:02.040> deal<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.299> he<00:02:03.420> has<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> removable

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
huge deal and then he has a removable

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.109 
huge deal and then he has a removable
mask<00:02:04.560> which<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.399> cool<00:02:05.579> feature<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
mask which is a really cool feature the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.789 
mask which is a really cool feature the
mask<00:02:06.299> looks<00:02:06.540> good<00:02:06.899> doesn't<00:02:07.259> look<00:02:07.380> too<00:02:07.530> big

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
mask looks good doesn't look too big

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
mask looks good doesn't look too big
when<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.640> comes<00:02:08.819> off<00:02:09.030> he's<00:02:09.720> got<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> face

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
when it comes off he's got a face

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.290 
when it comes off he's got a face
underneath<00:02:10.500> though<00:02:11.250> I'm<00:02:11.400> told<00:02:11.670> his<00:02:11.879> face<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
underneath though I'm told his face is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
underneath though I'm told his face is
nowhere<00:02:12.690> near<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.349> looks<00:02:13.500> like

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
nowhere near what it looks like

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770 
nowhere near what it looks like
the<00:02:13.860> game<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.640> anybody<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.270> plays<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> game

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the game so anybody that plays the game

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.930 
the game so anybody that plays the game
can<00:02:15.930> comment<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.470> let<00:02:16.770> me<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.940> it's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
can comment on that let me know it's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.760 
can comment on that let me know it's
disappointing<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.870> accurate<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.560> I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
disappointing if it's not accurate but I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.380 
disappointing if it's not accurate but I
would<00:02:20.040> leave<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.310> mask<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.640> anyway<00:02:21.030> because

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
would leave the mask on anyway because

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.850 
would leave the mask on anyway because
he<00:02:21.540> looks<00:02:21.720> way<00:02:21.870> cooler<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.650> I'm<00:02:22.740> happy

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
he looks way cooler with it so I'm happy

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.740 
he looks way cooler with it so I'm happy
about<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.820> eyes<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.300> seem<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
about that the eyes do seem to be a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.080 
about that the eyes do seem to be a
little<00:02:24.990> small<00:02:25.500> maybe<00:02:26.160> I'll<00:02:26.370> repaint<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
little small maybe I'll repaint on that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.460 
little small maybe I'll repaint on that
would<00:02:27.240> fix<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.570> up<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.720> still<00:02:28.140> looks<00:02:28.380> really

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
would fix it up but still looks really

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.090 
would fix it up but still looks really
good

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
good

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.490 
good
shoulder<00:02:30.090> articulation<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> fixed<00:02:31.320> hinge

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
shoulder articulation is the fixed hinge

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.350 
shoulder articulation is the fixed hinge
he<00:02:32.160> does<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> little<00:02:32.760> bit<00:02:32.850> better<00:02:33.090> range

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
he does have a little bit better range

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.630 
he does have a little bit better range
of<00:02:33.480> motion<00:02:33.540> than<00:02:33.990> sub-zero<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.190> that's<00:02:35.400> kind

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
of motion than sub-zero so that's kind

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.950 
of motion than sub-zero so that's kind
of<00:02:35.730> good<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.060> he's<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.570> narrower

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
of good I think he's a little narrower

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.710 
of good I think he's a little narrower
so<00:02:37.470> maybe<00:02:37.650> that's<00:02:37.890> why<00:02:38.070> but<00:02:38.430> no<00:02:38.910> bicep<00:02:39.360> swivel

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so maybe that's why but no bicep swivel

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.570 
so maybe that's why but no bicep swivel
but<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> hinge<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.160> swivel<00:02:41.460> in

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
but we do get the hinge in the swivel in

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.550 
but we do get the hinge in the swivel in
there<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:42.180> got<00:02:42.270> our<00:02:42.330> bicep<00:02:42.780> swivel<00:02:43.110> down<00:02:43.290> here

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
there we got our bicep swivel down here

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.230 
there we got our bicep swivel down here
in<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.740> elbow<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.610> pretty<00:02:44.880> functional

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
in the elbow so that's pretty functional

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.410 
in the elbow so that's pretty functional
it's<00:02:45.600> not<00:02:45.750> ideal<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.230> it'll<00:02:46.680> work<00:02:46.860> almost<00:02:47.610> 90

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it's not ideal but it'll work almost 90

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.090 
it's not ideal but it'll work almost 90
degrees<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:49.140> too<00:02:49.320> bad<00:02:49.530> then<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
degrees not too bad then we get the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.120 
degrees not too bad then we get the
wrist<00:02:50.280> swivel<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.420> hinge<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.740> that's

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
wrist swivel in the hinge so that's

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.510 
wrist swivel in the hinge so that's
alright<00:02:53.930> his<00:02:54.930> torso<00:02:55.200> actually<00:02:55.890> has<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> ball

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
alright his torso actually has a ball

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.780 
alright his torso actually has a ball
peg<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.240> very<00:02:57.900> limited<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.340> nearly<00:02:59.580> as

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
peg just very limited so not nearly as

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.040 
peg just very limited so not nearly as
good<00:02:59.850> as<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> diaphragm<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.660> again<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.930> would

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
good as a diaphragm and again I would

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.770 
good as a diaphragm and again I would
love<00:03:01.410> higher-end<00:03:02.340> version<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.030> guy<00:03:03.210> from

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
love higher-end version of this guy from

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.900 
love higher-end version of this guy from
mezco<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> diaphragm<00:03:04.830> joint<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.520> think

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
mezco with a diaphragm joint I think

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.760 
mezco with a diaphragm joint I think
that<00:03:06.060> would<00:03:06.180> suit<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> figure<00:03:06.720> very<00:03:06.960> well<00:03:07.200> but

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
that would suit the figure very well but

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.530 
that would suit the figure very well but
we<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:07.980> get<00:03:08.100> at<00:03:08.220> least<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.520> basically<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.150> waist

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
we do get at least a basically a waist

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510 
we do get at least a basically a waist
twist<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.140> that's<00:03:10.320> okay<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> hips<00:03:11.370> are

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
twist so that's okay then the hips are

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.670 
twist so that's okay then the hips are
mostly<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> same<00:03:12.300> as<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.870> sub-zero<00:03:13.140> we<00:03:13.530> get

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
mostly the same as the sub-zero we get

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.310 
mostly the same as the sub-zero we get
that<00:03:13.830> ball<00:03:14.070> peg<00:03:14.370> ball<00:03:15.240> socket<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> upper

hip and then a thigh swivel if I can do
it<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.410> kind<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.070> stuck<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:20.490> now<00:03:20.520> but<00:03:20.820> he

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
it it kind of stuck right now but he

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.460 
it it kind of stuck right now but he
does<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> thigh<00:03:21.420> swivel<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.080> one<00:03:22.260> works

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
does have a thigh swivel this one works

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.470 
does have a thigh swivel this one works
I<00:03:22.650> know<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.610> pretty<00:03:23.880> good<00:03:24.030> range<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.330> motion

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I know so pretty good range of motion

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.600 
I know so pretty good range of motion
the<00:03:24.780> new<00:03:24.990> has<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.440> hinge<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.070> swivel<00:03:26.430> as

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
the new has the hinge and the swivel as

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.030 
the new has the hinge and the swivel as
well<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.600> ankle<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.560> ball<00:03:28.770> peg

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
well then the ankle is just a ball peg

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.470 
well then the ankle is just a ball peg
but<00:03:29.130> he<00:03:29.250> gets<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.490> little<00:03:29.640> bit<00:03:29.760> better<00:03:30.030> range<00:03:30.360> of

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
but he gets a little bit better range of

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.160 
but he gets a little bit better range of
motion<00:03:30.620> than<00:03:31.620> sub-zero<00:03:32.930> supposing<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.020> guy

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
motion than sub-zero supposing this guy

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.810 
motion than sub-zero supposing this guy
is<00:03:34.230> not<00:03:34.470> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.800> great<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.310> it'll<00:03:35.700> be

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
is not going to be great but it'll be

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.970 
is not going to be great but it'll be
doable<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.480> since<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.170> sculpted<00:03:37.560> paint<00:03:37.800> is

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
doable and since the sculpted paint is

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.680 
doable and since the sculpted paint is
so<00:03:38.190> clean<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:38.520> so<00:03:38.850> nice<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.300> these<00:03:39.480> guys
