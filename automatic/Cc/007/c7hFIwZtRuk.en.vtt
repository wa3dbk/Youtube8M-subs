00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
different clockwork clockwork mode it

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.880 
different clockwork clockwork mode it
should<00:05:04.360> almost<00:05:04.660> be<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> same<00:05:05.350> just<00:05:05.710> follow

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
should almost be the same just follow

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.740 
should almost be the same just follow
kind<00:05:06.130> of<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.280> same<00:05:06.460> processes<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.240> know

kind of the same processes I know

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.900 
kind of the same processes I know
there's<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.140> that's<00:05:08.350> touch<00:05:08.800> again<00:05:09.760> it

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
there's one that's touch again it

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.550 
there's one that's touch again it
shouldn't<00:05:10.180> be<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.300> different<00:05:10.690> problem<00:05:11.320> and
