00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.310
 flour salt water and a container 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.450
 choose a container for it to be 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.880
 your dose hours all along the 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.440
 recipe according to the quantity of salt dough 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.940
 wanted to choose a dose more or less 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.600
 great 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:35.830
 so we start with the flour it 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.660
 need two doses of flour for this 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.080

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.390
 with the hands 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.799
 your dough is smoother and more 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.549
 handy once kneading it at least 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.380
