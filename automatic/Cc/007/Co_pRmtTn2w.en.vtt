 good this application that allows us 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.029
 make good two functions one can use 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.830
 our phone with android as a mouse 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.349
 wireless using either a bluetooth or 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.950
 wifi plus it also works like 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.220
 keyboard 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.480

 it is simply the application for 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.600
 android and also an application for 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.030
 our operating system 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.899
 in this case here this link 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.899
 copy it 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.590
 copying and sticking it 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.210
 and selection in our edition in my 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:21.580
 case is windows is also for mac 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.610
 for the 32 and 64 bit link 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.470
 what we do we keep my case 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.120
 delete the desktop 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.590
 save the arguments and you're 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.080
 remember that you also have to have 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.050
 application installed on your android this 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.909
 is the present of the first step here 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.610
 there is the application 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.680
 accept yes 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.150
 accept next next and can activate or 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.430
 disable this option to open the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.500
 program when turning on the computer that's going 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.330
 depend on whether they will use much by little 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.340
 in my case it is simply for 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.040
 show and from time to time what 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.300
 would come to use would not be so often that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.300
 so it's not going to activate that 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.160
 feature the next following e 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.160
 install they are going to run 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.560
 here in this one that is do not say how is 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.079
 connected through wifi or bluetooth 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.269
 in my case it will be through wifi here 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.400
 put the name of your device in my 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.489
 case they are called asper my computer 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.960
 you can put security or not in this 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.990
 case the descent disabled 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.880
 by password and good 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.890
 now let's proceed to connect 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.970
 Our telephone 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.970
 in this case 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.790
 I'm using two good cameras one is 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.550
 recording my screen and three is big 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.000
 - a phone to see that there is no trick 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.690
 good what will he do 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 we will see 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.220
 well of others 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.940
 color as well as those from my phone I'm going to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.220
 move a click 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.180
 but is that the right 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.390
 what is that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.600
 firefox to ask because I 'm not 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.390
 using you sing well you sing and it gives 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.960
 problem with the application and does not allow 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.770
 run the does not allow to record and corralito 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.770
 estimating something more time from youtube 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.420
 let's see a video of who is who 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.410
 in the educational 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.410
 three double points to show three 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 previous 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.480
 today after hearing what I have hearing aids 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.780
 and well they realize that I can use 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.220
 our phone with mouse 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.910
 here is a little bit more uncomfortable to feel 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.860
 we are going to study 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.010
 that they are any the mouse I am 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.010
 using 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.390
 it's a little complicated 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.430
 although I say 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.760
 it is clear with this part 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.970
 you can go scrolling down 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.060
 this part 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.190
 a good application if it is 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.510
 an emergency to another ration is 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.370
 thinking about this application that we have 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.110
 write documents moment word for 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.560
 it 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.560
 let's now a phone to write 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.440
 let's write 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.820
 or not 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.710
 my turn 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.890
 Hello 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.400
 sorry for the quality this second 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.950
 camera is not very good 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.840
 we go down a bit digital to measure it with 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.840
 the subscribers 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.950
 plus 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.910
 Y 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.580
 it goes away I wrote it in word 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.280
 perfectly 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.199
 I tell you it is an excellent application 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.169
 for daily use I do not recommend 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.680
 Sincerely, the recommendation is like 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.719
 not that it is better that you have your 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.150
 behavior connected to the best to this to 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.099
 a plasma screen and good you want 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.680
 using it as a remote control would be good 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.889
 option but to use it like this all the 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.870
 days I do not recommend it sincerely and 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.900
 good until this video ends 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.919
