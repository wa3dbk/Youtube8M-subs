 people to visit and tear as usual 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.360
 the guys look after their attention in the 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.340
 moment it works very well for olli like 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.459
 one can recognize by his grin 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.760
 oli feels confident over here 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.830
 do not even see his emotional state 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.110
 For the first time we have it with us 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.220
 created feelings 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.410
 with the help of these feelings you can 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.620
 Control how these new ones move like 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.670
 they feel and perceive life 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.040
 feelings give you extra 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.129
 possibilities you can more profound 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.519
 achieve stories with more potential 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.970
 I'll show you how andré is 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.970
 bored 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.190
 I will stir up the load 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.660
 I let Andreolli screw up the tour 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.940
 with this sad song has andreolli 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.040
 caused a depressive mood 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.709
 he just can not tears 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.510
 hold back I'll let him go 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.040
 before he makes a fool of himself 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.599
 thanks to his genius, andré 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.010
 now is the perfect opportunity for 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.989
 Sophia to hit the right tone 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.459
 armor all i maybe i have him one 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.530
 bit too far 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.750
 Over time, his depression becomes 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.930
 it will feel better, but it will abate 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.680
 still be a little sad 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.090
 emotional states offers me a lot 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.670
 various possibilities 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.780
 i want to cheer uli and i have 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.669
 already a plan 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.609
 I believe a little voodoo magic 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.079
 could brake andree 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.780
 with the voodoo doll I have turned on 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.379
 made a very angry sense and 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 Sofia 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.209
 she quickly loses interest in 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.489
 luck I have built a gym 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.409
 And a punching bag is perfect for one 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.079
 would like to drain some steam 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.730
 andré is still angry but with one 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.130
 few round the punching bag so I have him 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.539
 far that he calms down a bit he is 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.479
 still annoyed but his 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.830
 emotional state is less intense though 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.479
 if I want that andré one more 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.650
 he still has a chance at sofia 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.020
 relax a bit more 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.759
 these new gradual states of mind 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.990
 offers me brand new possibilities 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.270
 to play my teams 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.729
 while others want to be reassured we 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.650
 but stop by oli 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:42.099
 olli is in flirting mood and sophia 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.599
 his company enjoys the two 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.710
 have well that you watched 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.690
 a daring painting 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.550
 the decoration that I chose 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.310
 influences the emotional state of my 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.080
 teams and the mood heats up 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.450
 I will pair this budding 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.200
 be passionate and olli 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.290
 sofia poses a significant question 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.270
 do you want to see my rocket? 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.350
 that was direct but sofia sparkle fire 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.870

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.750
