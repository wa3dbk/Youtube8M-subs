00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that's a thing all right well I see it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
that's a thing all right well I see it
I'm<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> let<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.219> guys<00:00:41.579> try<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> solve

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
I'm going to let you guys try and solve

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.910 
I'm going to let you guys try and solve
it<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.110> considering<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it here so what I'm considering in this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.690 
it here so what I'm considering in this
position<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:47.129> king<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
position is that the king is in the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
position is that the king is in the
center<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.110> these<00:00:49.289> two<00:00:49.530> bishops

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
center and you have these two bishops

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
center and you have these two bishops
immediately<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> recognize<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
immediately you recognize them on the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.209 
immediately you recognize them on the
diagonals<00:00:51.989> along<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> Queen<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
diagonals along with the Queen here and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
diagonals along with the Queen here and
so<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.000> enough<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> these<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.660> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so when you see enough of these you just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.439 
so when you see enough of these you just
immediately<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:56.100> discovery<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.270> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
immediately know that a discovery is in

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.979 
immediately know that a discovery is in
order<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.930> powerful<00:00:58.440> discovered<00:00:59.070> check

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
order a powerful discovered check

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.849 
order a powerful discovered check
knowing<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> queen<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.440> under<00:01:01.739> attack

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
knowing that the queen is under attack

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
knowing that the queen is under attack
from<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> night<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.239> secondary<00:01:03.930> when

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
from the night is really secondary when

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.390 
from the night is really secondary when
you're<00:01:04.320> already<00:01:04.500> familiar<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.189> fact

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
you're already familiar with the fact

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
you're already familiar with the fact
that<00:01:05.489> there's<00:01:05.729> probably<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> powerful<00:01:06.600> tactic

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that there's probably a powerful tactic

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.620 
that there's probably a powerful tactic
that<00:01:07.200> makes<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.830> irrelevant<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that makes that irrelevant so what I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.000 
that makes that irrelevant so what I
immediately<00:01:09.930> start<00:01:10.320> considering<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.830> how

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
immediately start considering is how

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
immediately start considering is how
exactly<00:01:11.549> am<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> move<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.390> night<00:01:12.659> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
exactly am I going to move this night in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
exactly am I going to move this night in
order<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> unleash<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> powerful<00:01:14.159> discovery

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
order to unleash a powerful discovery

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600 
order to unleash a powerful discovery
well<00:01:15.140> if<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.290> move<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.650> some<00:01:16.860> random<00:01:17.100> square

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
well if I move to some random square

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.609 
well if I move to some random square
that<00:01:17.790> doesn't<00:01:18.150> change<00:01:18.180> any<00:01:18.750> factors<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that doesn't change any factors in the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.070 
that doesn't change any factors in the
position<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.340> my<00:01:20.460> queen<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.090> lost<00:01:21.299> but

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
position then my queen will be lost but

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
position then my queen will be lost but
if<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.770> power<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.369> bishops<00:01:23.759> on

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
if I use the power of my bishops on

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
if I use the power of my bishops on
these<00:01:24.000> diagonals<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.780> first<00:01:25.020> mentioned<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
these diagonals as I first mentioned and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.289 
these diagonals as I first mentioned and
move<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> night<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> squared<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.119> might

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
move the night to a squared that might

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.789 
move the night to a squared that might
help<00:01:27.540> unleash<00:01:27.900> those<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.500> okay<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
help unleash those that okay I

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
help unleash those that okay I
immediately<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.820> candidate<00:01:30.570> move<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
immediately see a candidate move that I

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
immediately see a candidate move that I
consider<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.590> must<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> answer

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
consider and I know must be the answer

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
consider and I know must be the answer
I'm<00:01:32.549> taking<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> he's<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> take

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
I'm taking here and he's going to take

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.160 
I'm taking here and he's going to take
my<00:01:34.140> queen<00:01:34.880> or<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.210> he's<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:36.930> up

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
my queen or not he's going to back up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
my queen or not he's going to back up
which<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.220> irrelevant<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.820> far<00:01:39.030> as

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
which actually is irrelevant as far as

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
which actually is irrelevant as far as
the<00:01:39.299> pattern<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> next<00:01:40.619> move<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the pattern because the next move is is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370 
the pattern because the next move is is
forced<00:01:41.729> regardless<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.020> Knight<00:01:43.200> f6

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
forced regardless which is Knight f6

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.580 
forced regardless which is Knight f6
double<00:01:44.369> check<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.880> mate<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.470> ever

double check and mate you know what ever

some double checks are just clean but a

lot of the power of the double check is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520 
lot of the power of the double check is
recognizing<00:02:21.300> even<00:02:21.480> when<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.440> know

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
recognizing even when you have you know

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.200 
recognizing even when you have you know
a<00:02:22.560> piece<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.070> under<00:02:23.340> fire<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.880> even<00:02:24.090> if

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
a piece that's under fire and even if

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.700 
a piece that's under fire and even if
both<00:02:24.390> pieces<00:02:24.660> were<00:02:24.870> under<00:02:25.110> attack<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
both pieces were under attack here it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.950 
both pieces were under attack here it
makes<00:02:26.160> no<00:02:26.370> difference<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:26.940> there's<00:02:27.720> no

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
makes no difference because there's no

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.200 
makes no difference because there's no
way<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.350> two<00:02:28.560> pieces<00:02:28.770> with<00:02:29.070> one<00:02:29.250> move<00:02:29.400> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
way to take two pieces with one move so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.520 
way to take two pieces with one move so
that's<00:02:30.390> your<00:02:30.480> answer<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:31.050> there<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
that's your answer right there and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.630 
that's your answer right there and
hopefully<00:02:31.710> going<00:02:32.160> through<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.490> thought

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
hopefully going through the thought

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.490 
hopefully going through the thought
process<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:33.390> what<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.660> look<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.930> quickly<00:02:34.350> can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.510 
should do more tactics trainer on chess
calm<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.350> really<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.220> matter<00:02:47.400> of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
calm but really it's just a matter of

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.150 
calm but really it's just a matter of
experience<00:02:48.210> where<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:49.470> only<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.860> only<00:02:50.040> thing

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
experience where the only the only thing

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.560 
experience where the only the only thing
that<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.370> prevent<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.850> from<00:02:50.880> considering

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that can prevent you from considering

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.700 
that can prevent you from considering
the<00:02:51.660> right<00:02:51.810> candidate<00:02:52.170> move<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.530> being

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
the right candidate move is just being

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.250 
the right candidate move is just being
dogmatic<00:02:52.920> about<00:02:53.430> material<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.300> dismissing<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
dogmatic about material and dismissing a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
dogmatic about material and dismissing a
move<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.160> Knight<00:02:56.370> takes<00:02:56.610> d7<00:02:57.060> because<00:02:57.360> your

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
move like Knight takes d7 because your

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.570 
move like Knight takes d7 because your
queen<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.840> under<00:02:58.020> attack<00:02:58.400> otherwise<00:02:59.400> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
queen is under attack otherwise you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.750 
queen is under attack otherwise you
would<00:02:59.700> never<00:02:59.820> do<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.890> because<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.430> as

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
would never do that because as you as

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.020 
would never do that because as you as
you<00:03:04.010> remember<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> ultimate<00:03:05.340> value<00:03:05.760> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
you remember that the ultimate value is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.700 
you remember that the ultimate value is
checkmate<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.780> course<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.200> value<00:03:07.650> of

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
checkmate and of course the the value of

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.230 
checkmate and of course the the value of
the<00:03:07.770> pieces<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.220> secondary<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.910> right

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
the pieces is secondary to that right

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.850 
the pieces is secondary to that right
those<00:03:09.540> are<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:10.020> guidelines<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.800> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
those are really just guidelines so to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.960 
those are really just guidelines so to
speak<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.310> know<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> value<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.850> pieces

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
speak you know the value of the pieces

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.820 
speak you know the value of the pieces
really<00:03:12.240> is<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.690> guidelines<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.470> know<00:03:13.590> rules
