00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 for not quite experienced or vice versa for 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.060
 experienced but not to the best risky people 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 there is a good recommendation 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.040
 know the edge yes don't fall a question how 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 avoid fatal mistakes on winter 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.180
 road how to learn feels limits 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.720
 your car's capabilities are changing 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.910
 time 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.730
 change we change and cars 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.769
 which we manage imperceptibly for us 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.170
 there is a new generation of drivers 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.640
 who can only drive cars with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.769
 Automatic transmission 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.510
 many of those who sit down today for 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.660
 steering wheel used to the fact that their mistakes 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.489
 corrects anti skidding system 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 nothing wrong with that however 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.210
 car owners equipped 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 stability control too 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 it is useful to go through an independent circuit 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 emergency preparation of our today's 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 training cars is a double 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.789
 look despite the modest external 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 dimensions in this baby clearly felt 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.500
 senior breed breed 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 Mercedes would seem short 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.520
 rear wheel drive little car 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.430
 only for summer but well tuned and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 highway and clear stabilization system 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.799
 make it easy and safe to move around 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 snow covered roads 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.700
 so here is the driver and driver 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.740
 car from e spi 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.720
 but like everyone else useful 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 practice on the spacious free 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.939
 sites at the start of your car 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 up to 40 50 kilometers an hour and then 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.799
 try to brake more quickly for 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 change several of these exercises 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.970
 effort on the brake pedal every time 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.729
 achieving both triggered 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.950
 so you remember as much as possible 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.200
 possible effectiveness of slowing down by 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 branch this feeling is useful to you and in 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.490
 real road situation second 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 the exercise involves all the same 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.680
 acceleration and turning movement at the beginning of smooth and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.100
 then with each repetition all the cooler and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.290
 cooler 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.960
 due to this, you will learn to feel 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.659
 coupling qualities of tires and character 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.520
 cornering behavior besides 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.710
 turning on the edge of a slip gives 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.600
 an opportunity to understand how to really 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.049
 electronics stabilizes the car and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
 to what extent can it be calculated 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.380
 not bad helps driving 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.060
 improvised dare right here counter 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
 skid on the system will work in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 full force weighs 15 repeats on 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.840
 braking cornering 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.270
 snakes will help gain confidence for 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.580
 driving and find the very edge which 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.800
 better not to approach 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.170
 snake inhibition turn all this is possible 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.630
 make on the way in between on any 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.460
 free site and in normal 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.560
 everyday driving when you learn 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.350
 control the quality of your driving 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.250
 on absence of operation 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.490
 anti-lock and anti- skid on 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 system yellow light blinked down 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.780
 pace increase distance 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.720
 temper your fervor you drive too 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.209
 carelessly and therefore dangerous in the end 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.000
 main winter advice no matter what 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.800
 don't be in a hurry read the road 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.200
 situation for oneself and for others on 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.510
 few steps forward and not by itself 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.310
 make sharp movements of Omsk and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.440
 traffic control autosphere program 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.440
 wishes you only a happy journey
