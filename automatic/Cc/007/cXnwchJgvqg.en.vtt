00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.460
 warmly tipped to a new episode 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.920
 today with one of the absolute classics 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.370
 today the two copies heavy the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.990
 Bodybuilding protein cookies will be mega 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.960
 Tasty stays off in any case 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 Here you go, you see the ingredients and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 nutritional values ​​for today's recipe 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 need two bananas 150 km 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 oatmeal two scoops chocolate protein 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.489
 powder walnut kernels optional cranberries 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
 Coconut sprinkles and sweetener catch 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 let's say that we are ours 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.469
 weigh oatmeal as I said in the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.149
 case 150 grams afterwards the bananas on 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.800
 best cut small 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.480
 For example, I am dismembered 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.070
 You can then either to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.450
 example with his food processor 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.280
 somehow soften a bit 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 or I just like it here 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.699
 it takes a bit with the fork 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.980
 longer I would say you need that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.270
 three to five minutes 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 then really a soft one 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.629
 So consistency has no 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 banana pieces more leftover you have them 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.150
 also makes it with a lot of love for 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.760
 detail then the two coups protein 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 powder and oatmeal the 150 grams 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.740
 to what I make extremely tasty 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.299
 are walnut kernels as said when they are 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 you still have a whole form 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.570
 back the a bit with the fork 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
 give her what I personally still 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.350
 very much like it just like that again 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.780
 10 cranberries give the stay then 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.689
 as a whole piece in the cookies 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.579
 In it extremely delicious are doing very well 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 it becomes banana chocolate taste 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.880
 after that at about 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 I would say about three minutes with 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.020
 the fork that makes itself very good 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.310
 behind after the baking sheet and an 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 bit of cooking spray on it 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 nothing burns and women after that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.180
 cookies you get about ten cookies 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 it if we now six to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.149
 the sheet metal I find the aesthetics 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.210
 The preparation must not be lost 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.210
 That's why I'm extremely well suited 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.700
 are still the cocoons sprinkle for then 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.439
 about 5 minutes at 180 ° the oven 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.570

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.590
