goes above the screen so this has a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.210 
goes above the screen so this has a
little<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.230> lay<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.650> table<00:01:58.680> design

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it is dead on right there you see it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440 
it is dead on right there you see it
it's<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.880> bit<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.270> not<00:02:27.420> a

the silicone very easy to use that fact
is<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> little<00:02:47.459> bit<00:02:47.550> easier<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.150> silicone

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
is a little bit easier with the silicone

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.229 
is a little bit easier with the silicone
over<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> wasn't<00:02:49.680> over<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.239> very

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
