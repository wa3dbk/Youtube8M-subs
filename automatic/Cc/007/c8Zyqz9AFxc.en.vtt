00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 I mentioned the subject 's design 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.050
 amazing 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.899
 it means the move that has not only the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.829
 basic function plus a different form 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.519
 to fulfill this function at our school 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.519
 pau brasil was created that property that 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.100
 you see here we call it says 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.879
 I came because it reminds me a bit of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.780
 dance 30 's movement said 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.390
 minc 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.969
 this template was created because we 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.800
 We learned that the apartments are 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.339
 ever smaller 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.850
 the space to store things continue to 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.700
 be necessary and especially the woman 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.540
 which has many things to store jewelry 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.520
 so we wanted to believe and wanted to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.549
 create a different proposal for 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 save jewelry these things have a 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.170
 which at the same time has its 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.840
 function is different beautiful 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 these 20 games and create a black because 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.829
 was inspired even by the waves 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.789
 by the curved black tourism here in our 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.930
 and so we have this 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.799
 black mdf language along with a 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.680
 not only the region that is the way 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.710
 and of the reforestation and carlito 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.509
 we collect waste in this case and 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.329
 we also comply with the aspect of 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.000
 sustainability you see what 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.000
 it looks like an eclipse panel generate 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 waste of 23 4 centimeters 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 So you can see that we 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.910
 has changed the way you have access to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.570
 content of one of a road 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:25.040
 the two sides opens the access is direct and 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:30.110
 the drawers are made again with the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.240
 wood and Clinton and injurious to the proposal 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.610
 which is to show that flexibility to 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.010
 individuality of the person is respected 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
 if someone who is many covered in the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.010
 we fill everything upside down if someone 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.980
 want open spaces we also do 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.250
 the way the customer is that idea 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.810
 of our design the design can not 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.830
 force the client to deter - 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.980
 possibility in use 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.860
 we have to adapt and show that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.800
 is the customer actually that dog promotes 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.120
 in our case to sustain the school 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.920
 the customer who has to have the comfort but 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:19.280
 the language of the two of two colors 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.709
 strong the black is only breath is a 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 It also seeks to demonstrate that sometimes 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.330
 materials that at first did not 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.830
 it seems that they combine solid wood 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.280
 he is 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 they combine very well if we seek 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.990
 balance in the design does not exaggerate the 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.020
 clinical material shows the body of the 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.880
 element but does not come with more 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.690
 elements on top of that 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.580
 so we understand design this is mine 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:58.760
 old school I am one of the generation 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.180
 balaus who respected that everything that we 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.209
 we should see that we should reduce 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.720
 reached the maximum effect 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.810
 then it is if the lincon example 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.810
 job 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:39.610
 the other example of sustainable real estate 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:42.569
 with a design that home office here that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.340
 very compact also respect the space 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:51.580
 limited customer but at the same time 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.620
 offers plenty of storage space for 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.620
 things and to work from home 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:04.750
 the idea for use for the whole family 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:08.319
 each one has its space its all place 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:13.569
 the elements are movable to place 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:18.659
 where the customer wants it he does it the way 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:22.599
 what you want and have on your desk 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:26.580
 the idea is to have fast in a few seconds 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:30.729
 a workspace is to comfortably 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:36.240
 chair that logically matches with 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:43.030
 stuff work quiet and finished 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:45.479
 in a few seconds the space at home for 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.479
 the bush 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.389
 this is not just a mobile 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.979
 this is a solution is to use a 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:06:00.699
 people to enjoy the 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:03.930
 your name and felt the clever design 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.930
 behind it 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.870
 is
