 I now have all the elements so 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.660
 I will show you all the set up 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:21.109

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.410
 the happy age is a battery 4s its 3300 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 1,2 for the brain video in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:06.080
 carbon composite my channing receiver 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 which in diversity the engine team motor 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:20.930
 770 cellar and a 10-by-five propeller and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.080
 that's all I need to go up 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.430
 it's quite practical because it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.690
 practically nothing that will exceed will have 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.760
 just that the cameras that are going to be 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.170
 outside with the transmitter antenna 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.320
 and the two antennas of the receiver 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.210
 channing so go for the rest 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.900
 when she will be the first to climb 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.900
