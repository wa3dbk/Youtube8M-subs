00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
different cards in my 25 this year with

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.439 
different cards in my 25 this year with
the<00:04:46.560> football<00:04:46.770> outsider<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.819> most<00:04:48.060> feared

the football outsider and most feared
and<00:04:48.660> whatnot<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.949> is<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.160> pretty<00:04:50.490> good

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
and whatnot but this is a pretty good

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.409 
and whatnot but this is a pretty good
card<00:04:51.289> 98<00:04:52.289> man<00:04:52.560> coverage<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.310> course<00:04:53.639> pops<00:04:54.090> out

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
card 98 man coverage of course pops out

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.350 
card 98 man coverage of course pops out
that's<00:04:54.750> really<00:04:55.169> nice<00:04:55.319> but<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.860> 93<00:04:56.550> speed<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.300> a

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
that's really nice but the 93 speed is a

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.170 
that's really nice but the 93 speed is a
bit<00:04:58.169> iffy<00:04:58.590> if<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.889> imagine<00:04:59.069> him<00:04:59.610> going<00:04:59.880> up

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
bit iffy if you imagine him going up

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.240 
bit iffy if you imagine him going up
that<00:05:00.330> Randy<00:05:00.750> Moss<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.169> just<00:05:01.470> showed<00:05:01.770> there

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
that Randy Moss I just showed there

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.939 
that Randy Moss I just showed there
would<00:05:02.970> definitely<00:05:03.300> be<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:04.080> clear<00:05:04.560> speed

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
would definitely be a clear speed

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.680 
would definitely be a clear speed
difference<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.610> would<00:05:05.909> be<00:05:05.940> how<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.389> guy

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
difference and that would be how a guy

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.110 
difference and that would be how a guy
like<00:05:06.720> moss<00:05:07.319> could<00:05:07.620> beat<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.039> Revis<00:05:08.580> but

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
like moss could beat this Revis but

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.370 
like moss could beat this Revis but
nonetheless<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.960> pretty<00:05:10.560> nice<00:05:11.250> card<00:05:12.380> finally

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
nonetheless a pretty nice card finally

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
we have this 95 rg3 I was kind of

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.370 
we have this 95 rg3 I was kind of
drooling<00:05:17.610> when<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.909> saw<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.300> stats<00:05:18.840> at<00:05:19.110> first

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
drooling when I saw the stats at first

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.460 
drooling when I saw the stats at first
on<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.770> back<00:05:19.949> of<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.250> card<00:05:20.720> 94<00:05:21.720> speed<00:05:22.110> for<00:05:22.440> a

on the back of this card 94 speed for a
QB<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:23.220> course<00:05:23.550> pops<00:05:24.000> out<00:05:24.389> he's<00:05:24.750> even<00:05:25.080> faster

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
QB of course pops out he's even faster

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.559 
QB of course pops out he's even faster
than<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.889> Revis<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.520> just<00:05:26.909> showed<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.180> guys

deep<00:05:49.289> we<00:05:49.469> also<00:05:49.650> see<00:05:50.039> in<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.280> bottom<00:05:50.669> right<00:05:51.030> but

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
deep we also see in the bottom right but

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.899 
deep we also see in the bottom right but
keyed<00:05:51.990> be<00:05:52.199> really<00:05:52.560> good<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:52.919> have<00:05:53.190> my<00:05:53.669> one

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
keyed be really good to have my one

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.830 
keyed be really good to have my one
concern<00:05:54.180> is<00:05:54.719> the<00:05:55.159> 84<00:05:56.159> injury<00:05:56.940> because<00:05:57.270> Steve

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
concern is the 84 injury because Steve

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.070 
concern is the 84 injury because Steve
Young<00:05:58.110> has<00:05:58.490> 95<00:05:59.490> injury<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.360> seems<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:00.780> get

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
Young has 95 injury and seems to get

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.159 
Young has 95 injury and seems to get
hurt<00:06:01.349> pretty<00:06:01.590> much<00:06:01.919> every<00:06:02.460> single<00:06:02.880> game<00:06:03.180> so

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
hurt pretty much every single game so

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.779 
hurt pretty much every single game so
that<00:06:04.469> is<00:06:04.650> something<00:06:04.889> I<00:06:05.190> would<00:06:05.250> worry<00:06:05.699> about

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
that is something I would worry about

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.439 
that is something I would worry about
what<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.419> rg3<00:06:06.949> but<00:06:07.949> otherwise<00:06:08.340> he<00:06:08.849> is<00:06:09.090> a

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
what that rg3 but otherwise he is a

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.170 
what that rg3 but otherwise he is a
pretty<00:06:10.229> good<00:06:10.560> car<00:06:10.979> based<00:06:11.340> off<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:11.789> stats

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
pretty good car based off of the stats

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.050 
pretty good car based off of the stats
