 Welcome to "Wrinkles with Yvonne"! 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 Today I'll show you how to fold a rose from banknotes. 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 That's the way the rose should look at the end, let's go! 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.640
 You will need 3 bills, a tack, scissors and a pencil with eraser. 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.640
 If you do not have a green pencil, then you can do it like me with a green crepe 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.480
 and Tesa dress up. 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.200
 Links to the cheap purchase of materials on Amazon can be found in the video description. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.920
 Take the first note and cut it in half. 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.760
 Open the banknote again and fold the lower half to the newly developed folding edge 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 out. 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.760
 Halve the note in width and open it again. 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.880
 Halve it lengthwise and open it again. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.760
 Fold up the lower left corner with the folding edge created in the middle. 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.720
 Repeat the step with the lower right corner. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.920
 Now fold the tip that points to you about a finger wide up. 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.320
 Turn the banknote over and fold the triangle up on the other side. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.880
 Turn the bill around and open it again. 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.480
 Now you repeat the folding steps with the other two corners. 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.080
 Smooth all folds so that you will not see any when you fold the rose 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.240
 Have problems. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.600
 Open the bill again and repeat these steps with the other two 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200
 Bills. 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800
 Now take your pair of scissors and the first note at hand. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 Turn the banknote over and drive the corners of the note over the blade of the coin 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.360
 Scissors, that they roll inwards. 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.800
 This is how the bill should look like. He will make the inside of your rose. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 Take the second note and do not turn it around this time. 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.400
 Use the blade of the scissors to drive over the corners so that they roll up easily. 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.280
 Repeat this step also on the 3rd bill. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.960
 This will be the two outer leaves of your rose. 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.640
 Now put the 3 bills on top of each other. 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.200
 Take your tack and put it through the middle of the 3 bills. 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.080
 Take your pencil and put the tack in the eraser. Almost there! 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.040
 Now take these folded edges of the top banknote between your thumb and forefinger and press 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.760
 the pre-folded triangles together. 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 Flip the 2 triangles backwards. They are held behind by the bill. 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.560
 Shape the bud of your rose by squeezing the note a little bit more. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.240
 Now take the folded edges of the middle banknote and press them together again. 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.240
 Hide the resulting triangles underneath. 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.080
 Repeat this step now on the bottom banknote and your rose is ready 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.320
 folded! 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.280
