00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.450
 Hello and welcome My name is a direct red card software and 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.740
 I want to be in Noida 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 Primor notebook in conjunction with the Kyritzer pay 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.929
 Pekarek servers on a central computer within the school now 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 Installed 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.110
 Headmaster and teacher circling over Brown at a notebook on this sampler 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.140
 So I'm going to have the system with husband and son Dieckmann password 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.529
 and get the students that do not concern, that means everyone 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.510
 Students the simple dishes 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.410
 or faster the classes easier 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.060
 At first, the most important information is not presented in the city senate 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.010
 including on the BlackRock important news or upcoming events for 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.260
 today 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.650
 on the Performance view when all submissions are captured 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.270
 you can finally get the view like noam murro paper a user 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.920
 and files 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.500
 this improves the clarity 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 and he wants to prescribe the switch to the electronic one above 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.490
 Censorship becomes the add-on 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.330
 a remark 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.010
 and a weight saved 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.670
 In addition, all notes can be grouped into categories 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.120
 Many calculation models can be mapped 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.680
 To make annual interest rates at the end of the first half of the year can be reported average 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.380
 be used 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 this happens in Bilstein individual student 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 or for the whole class or group 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.450
 the ducks or handwork them anytime again 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.690
 be overwritten by hand 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 The change concerns a trend follows made visible 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.450
 to quickly deficits or performance dips in students too 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.130
 The notes can be automatically colored according to their good value 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.840
 the services can also be processed as graphics 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.030
 or with the Gradient tool 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
 Anyone can add any point since the school year 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.950
 be simulated with the corresponding intersections respectively 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 grades awarded at that time 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.319
 the tool periods 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 allowed Malin Brietzke look into last school year 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.230
 Examination credits can also be entered via the examination view 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.749
 the calculation of smart models 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.599
 and exam chair in central server 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.250
 if he is working the callback server can be class leader or the 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.409
 School board on notes to grab the subjects 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 which are taught by other colleagues 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.789
 the access is purely informal and only happens to read about manipulations 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:51.129
 Exclude conventional solutions like the Neumann Buchenberg their format 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.469
 or in the sense solutions for electronic above capture 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.199
 and at the decisive disadvantage 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.889
 that scores the men 5 can set a time for a colleague 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.669
 this disadvantage 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.479
 with the Kalex Halver 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.849
 completely canceled 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.579
 Of course this has no significant increase in efficiency consequences 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:15.819
 Thank you for your attention 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.829
 maybe until later
