00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 One of the most fascinating adventures of my life, 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 consumatasi within a few days. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 I never expected to be able to accompany my friend Silvio Reffo 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 on the island that all climbers dream of: Kalymnos. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 Silvio Reffo received the invitation to The North Face Kalymnos Climbing Festival unexpectedly, 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 but he immediately welcomed it with great enthusiasm. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 As soon as we arrive we enter this wonderful island without hesitation. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 I follow Silvio for the entire duration of the event, 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 our gaze lost in the wonders of the place, 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 guests of a parallel reality and far from that of our daily life. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 Silvio's eyes and thoughts often turn towards the interior of the island, 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 where are these compact walls of reddish limestone, 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 characterized by particular canes and veins that run through them throughout their development. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 The thrill of making a mark in a meeting like this is great, 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 but always accompanied by the humility that characterizes a similar event. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 The sun, the sea and the peaceful atmosphere can distract you 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 from the real reason why the athletes were invited: the Project Competition. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 Now for Silvio it's time to confront the most crystalline talents of the world scene, 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 on specially equipped routes in a new crag. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 He doesn't let himself be intimidated by the very high technical rate, 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 even if I read in his eyes that insatiable desire to do my best. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 The term Competition does not fully reflect this reality: 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 athletes explain passages to each other and incite one another, 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 the climate is one of friendship and mutual respect. 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 All is perfect. The result? 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 Everyone is the winner of one of the most sensational and aesthetic events ever seen. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 Let the party begin and let life continue, 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 maybe on a scooter.
