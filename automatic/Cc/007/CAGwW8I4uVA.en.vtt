here let's take a look at the different
menu<00:01:09.479> styles<00:01:10.190> throws<00:01:11.190> cosmos<00:01:12.020> let's<00:01:13.020> take<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
menu styles throws cosmos let's take a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.770 
menu styles throws cosmos let's take a
look<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.350> matrix<00:01:16.790> now<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> digital

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
look at matrix now you get the digital

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.560 
look at matrix now you get the digital
clock<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> bottom<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.190> is<00:01:20.340> more

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
clock in the bottom on this is more

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
clock in the bottom on this is more
intuitional<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> makes<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.009> more

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
intuitional like it makes a little more

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
intuitional like it makes a little more
sense<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:23.759> used<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.060> using<00:01:24.350> just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
sense because we're used to using just

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.399 
sense because we're used to using just
