00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
take the next level on here let's go

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.089 
take the next level on here let's go
so<00:00:25.550> if<00:00:26.570> world<00:00:27.570> three<00:00:27.900> four<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> secret<00:00:28.859> egg

so if world three four is a secret egg
is<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> guess<00:00:30.330> I'll<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> put<00:00:31.019> the

is it I guess I'll have to put the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.270 
is it I guess I'll have to put the
regular<00:00:31.560> exit<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.570> end<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.280> I'm

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
regular exit in at the end of it I'm

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.500 
regular exit in at the end of it I'm
asking<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.850> confusing<00:00:36.450> its<00:00:36.719> heck<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:38.210> got<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.010 

sit<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.600> piece<00:00:42.810> which<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.380> know<00:00:45.020> there's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
sit this piece which I know there's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.300 
sit this piece which I know there's
probably<00:00:46.170> power<00:00:46.470> up<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:48.800> in<00:00:49.800> those<00:00:50.010> blocks

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
probably power up and in those blocks

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.430 
probably power up and in those blocks
down<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.880> but<00:00:51.210> well<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:55.170> looking<00:00:55.230> like

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
down there but well it's looking like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.800 
down there but well it's looking like
the<00:00:55.590> hitting<00:00:56.580> this<00:00:56.700> red<00:00:56.970> switch<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.630> gonna

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
the hitting this red switch is gonna

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.830 
the hitting this red switch is gonna
come<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.170> handy<00:00:59.120> this<00:01:00.120> block<00:01:00.450> here<00:01:00.690> which<00:01:00.780> I

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
come in handy this block here which I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
come in handy this block here which I
didn't<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.080> what<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.440> before<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.340> just

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
didn't know what it did before it's just

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.729 
didn't know what it did before it's just
a<00:01:02.610> propeller<00:01:02.970> mushroom<00:01:03.330> just<00:01:04.050> without<00:01:04.290> having

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
a propeller mushroom just without having

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.219 
a propeller mushroom just without having
one<00:01:05.090> it's<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.660> that's<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
one it's actually kind of that's kind of

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.590 
one it's actually kind of that's kind of
stupid<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.970> takes<00:01:12.210> away<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
stupid I think and like takes away the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.180 
stupid I think and like takes away the
whole<00:01:12.750> benefit<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> having<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.650> power<00:01:13.800> in<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
whole benefit of having the power in the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.760 
whole benefit of having the power in the
first<00:01:14.369> place<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.840> could<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.110> ice<00:01:16.320> Mario

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
first place so you could have ice Mario

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.430 
first place so you could have ice Mario
and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.010> pick<00:01:17.190> this<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:19.229> know<00:01:21.440> but

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
and then pick this up you know but

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.700 
and then pick this up you know but
whatever<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:26.180> got<00:01:27.180> Piranha<00:01:27.450> Plants<00:01:27.960> shooting

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
whatever I got Piranha Plants shooting
