of<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.640> which<00:00:36.630> I'll<00:00:36.930> say<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> few<00:00:37.860> things<00:00:37.920> about

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
of it which I'll say a few things about

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
of it which I'll say a few things about
first<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:41.210> long<00:00:42.210> runs<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> major

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
first of all the long runs are the major

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.910 
first of all the long runs are the major
issue<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> program<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
issue in the program and you want the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.540 
issue in the program and you want the
long<00:00:47.129> runs<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.879> run<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:49.079> slowly<00:00:49.550> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
long runs to be run very very slowly so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.479 
long runs to be run very very slowly so
how<00:00:51.480> slowly<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:53.100> want

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
how slowly is that well you don't want

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.930 
how slowly is that well you don't want
to<00:00:53.730> huff<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.600> puff<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.379> any<00:00:55.980> point<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.730> your

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to huff and puff at any point in your

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
to huff and puff at any point in your
run<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> website<00:00:59.160> is<00:01:00.170> are<00:01:01.170> some

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
run but on the website is are some

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.820 
run but on the website is are some
guidelines<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.699> tell<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.750> slow<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
guidelines that can tell you how slow to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.250 
guidelines that can tell you how slow to
run<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.640> look<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> website<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
run so so look at the website and it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.940 
run so so look at the website and it
will<00:01:07.439> lead<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.920> through<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.400> process

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
will lead you through that process

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.460 
will lead you through that process
secondly<00:01:10.950> walk<00:01:11.670> breaks<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.330> huge<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> how

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
secondly walk breaks are huge and how

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
secondly walk breaks are huge and how
they<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:14.010> allow<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:15.000> legs<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.450> revive

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
they will allow your legs to revive

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.429 
they will allow your legs to revive
themselves<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:17.360> recommend<00:01:18.360> putting<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.140> one

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
themselves I recommend putting a one

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
themselves I recommend putting a one
minute<00:01:19.619> walk<00:01:19.950> break<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.780> long

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
minute walk break into all of your long

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.490 
minute walk break into all of your long
runs<00:01:22.409> after<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:24.119> minute<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.869> minutes<00:01:25.290> or

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
runs after one minute two minutes or

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
runs after one minute two minutes or
three<00:01:25.799> minutes<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.400> running<00:01:27.020> those<00:01:28.020> who<00:01:28.229> are

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
three minutes of running those who are

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.060 
three minutes of running those who are
very<00:01:28.860> fast<00:01:29.159> runners<00:01:29.840> could<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.200> long<00:01:31.770> as

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
very fast runners could go as long as

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
very fast runners could go as long as
three<00:01:32.640> minutes<00:01:33.000> before<00:01:33.390> taking<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> walk<00:01:34.020> break
