00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
all right there is one final method for

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.350 
all right there is one final method for
the<00:00:10.990> chance<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.440> Max<00:00:11.650> install<00:00:12.190> this<00:00:13.059> will<00:00:13.270> be

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
the chance and Max install this will be

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.510 
the chance and Max install this will be
the<00:00:13.480> method<00:00:13.660> that<00:00:14.020> the<00:00:14.590> least<00:00:14.889> amount<00:00:15.219> of<00:00:15.370> you

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
the method that the least amount of you

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.670 
the method that the least amount of you
will<00:00:15.700> choose<00:00:15.969> but<00:00:16.510> I<00:00:16.780> wanted<00:00:17.050> to<00:00:17.110> show<00:00:17.410> it<00:00:17.530> to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
you can use a reverse osmosis faucet

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.279 
you can use a reverse osmosis faucet
like<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.070> one<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:42.370> we<00:00:42.579> supply<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:44.050> is

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
like the one that we supply this is

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.150 
like the one that we supply this is
called<00:00:44.530> our<00:00:44.680> chance<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.219> c3<00:00:45.850> faucet<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.980> can

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
called our chance and c3 faucet you can

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.279 
called our chance and c3 faucet you can
install<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.760> as<00:00:48.879> we<00:00:49.239> talked<00:00:49.539> about<00:00:49.719> in<00:00:50.079> the

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
install it as we talked about in the

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.470 
install it as we talked about in the
last<00:00:50.469> segment<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.489> bowl<00:00:51.760> on<00:00:51.789> top<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
last segment and a bowl on top of the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.580 
last segment and a bowl on top of the
sink<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.910> basically<00:00:54.910> your<00:00:55.149> ionizer<00:00:55.750> would<00:00:56.440> be

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
sink and basically your ionizer would be

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.520 
sink and basically your ionizer would be
installed<00:00:57.010> in<00:00:57.219> one<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.579> two<00:00:57.730> places<00:00:58.530> your

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
installed in one of two places your

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.420 
installed in one of two places your
ionizer<00:01:00.010> would<00:01:00.309> either<00:01:00.460> be<00:01:00.730> installed<00:01:05.430> via

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
ionizer would either be installed via

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.550 
ionizer would either be installed via
these<00:01:06.670> two<00:01:07.440> hanging<00:01:08.550> holes<00:01:09.550> here<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:11.350> can

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560
