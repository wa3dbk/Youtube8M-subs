my daughter and that's what I really
really<00:02:19.459> started<00:02:19.819> thinking<00:02:19.909> about<00:02:20.150> things<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
really started thinking about things and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.670

that and I thought you know I need to be

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.900 
that and I thought you know I need to be
able<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.890> balance<00:02:37.069> this<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.580> little<00:02:37.760> bit

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
able to balance this out a little bit

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.720 
able to balance this out a little bit
and<00:02:38.269> trying<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.230> keep<00:02:39.379> up<00:02:39.620> with<00:02:39.730> developing

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and trying to keep up with developing

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.430 
and trying to keep up with developing
and<00:02:40.940> scanning<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.510> shooting<00:02:41.810> all<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.140> film

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
and scanning and shooting all that film

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.080 
and scanning and shooting all that film
it<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.190> wasn't<00:02:43.430> gonna<00:02:43.519> work<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:43.940> me

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it just wasn't gonna work for me

it just wasn't gonna work for me
personally<00:02:44.329> with<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.840> amount<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.500> to

with the rest of my family so that's

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.479 
with the rest of my family so that's

what led me to buying the x100t I just

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.589 
what led me to buying the x100t I just
needed<00:02:58.760> something<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.239> could<00:02:59.269> always

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
needed something that I could always

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.330 
needed something that I could always

bit smaller and lighter and that's just

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.229 
bit smaller and lighter and that's just
a<00:03:18.680> personal<00:03:18.859> preference<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.639> not<00:03:19.790> about<00:03:19.970> one

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
being better than the other but that's

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.979 
being better than the other but that's
how<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.280> landed<00:03:22.519> on<00:03:22.669> the<00:03:22.790> x100t<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.750> know<00:03:23.870> it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.400 
day because really that's all that
matters<00:04:01.639> it<00:04:01.879> should<00:04:02.120> always<00:04:02.329> be<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:03.290> you

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
matters it should always be that you

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.259 
matters it should always be that you
have<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.859> photo<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.730> should<00:04:04.910> be<00:04:05.030> about

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
have the photo and it should be about

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.940 
have the photo and it should be about
the<00:04:05.480> photo<00:04:05.660> itself<00:04:06.019> rather<00:04:06.410> than<00:04:06.680> what<00:04:06.829> you

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
the photo itself rather than what you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.920 
the photo itself rather than what you
use<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.220> make<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.700> photo<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.510> that's<00:04:08.690> pretty

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
use to make the photo so that's pretty

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.020 
use to make the photo so that's pretty
much<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.260> on<00:04:09.349> why<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.560> bought<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.919> x100t<00:04:10.639> like<00:04:10.940> I
