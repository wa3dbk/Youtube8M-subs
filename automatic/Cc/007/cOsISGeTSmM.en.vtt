00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.160
 Today it became clear that the number of resorts 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.350
 where is it scary to go after egypt and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 Tunisia risk replenished traditionally 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 Crimea popular among Russians 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 according to the conclusion of mycologists along 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 Black Sea coast from the famous 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.190
 tourist places like swallow 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 nests flooded from hundreds of metal 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 barrels chemical weapons this 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.369
 containers hastily buried back in forty 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 the first before the onset of the Germans but the term 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.720
 barrels expired from some 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 seawater is already leaking poisonous 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 substances authorities of the Crimea to recognize it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
 refuse accusing journalists of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.670
 trying to wreck with the tourist season 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.670
 good valeev conducted his investigation 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.070
 what a deserted Yalta embankment 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.200
 happens only at the end of February beginning 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 March in the absence of tourists captain 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 pleasure boat with pleasure 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.360
 agrees to participate in this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
 expeditions especially as we sail far 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 do not have the secrets of the black sea which 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.610
 we are interested very close to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.739
 coastline 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.589
 a scuba diver dives into the water just on 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.659
 30 meters here it is overgrown and light bulb 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.100
 which carries a deadly threat 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:08.390
 around the Crimea to narrowing including the Kerch 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 up to 1200 containers 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 we found more than 500 and identified 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.259
 areas under according to our data 11 areas in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.630
 which were carried out 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.729
 discharges of these containers and, moreover, or 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.440
 visits this is a terrible heritage second 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.690
 world forty first year in Crimea 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.140
 a huge amount has accumulated 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.030
 chemical weapons 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.770
 Geneva forbade its use 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.710
 convention therefore before the arrival of the Germans 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.409
 poison decided to flood the sea were placed in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.599
 normal barrels drowned hurrying as horrible 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.459
 and wherever it surfaced it 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.679
 the story is just because the barrels were 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.160
 designed for 70 years i.e. their term 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.580
 services 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.539
 Expired a few months ago in 2010 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.729
 year ended warranty periods 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.580
 preserve the integrity of the integrity of these 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.349
 containers that is theoretically 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.259
 it turns out that 2011 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.819
 possible fractures of these containers on 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 trouble is a chemical disposal card 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.479
 weapons match the list of most 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.970
 famous Crimean places here for example 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.770
 The swallow's nest is generally visiting 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.530
 Crimea card on documents somewhere 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.569
 60 barrels are stored under water here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 chemical weapons of every journalist 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.900
 telling about the Crimean problems 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.270
 suspected of deliberately exploding 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.440
 tourist season so here without 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.530
 no serious evidence 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.730
 Here they are 2004, the Crimean authorities ordered 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.010
 seabed research 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.350
 environmental firm that is following the results 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 work wrote a report in it coordinates 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.730
 all place where chemical is found 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.950
 the weapon and the exact number of barrels are all 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.770
 favorite places vacationers Feodosia 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.880
 bay doveland nest coast and 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.070
 you are cape fiolent 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.390
 then the document was hung strictly 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.430
 secretly and tried 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.500
 forget about him a journalist and a deputy 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.210
 Supreme glad Vladimir Aryev could their 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.830
 get only using your 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.620
 deputy powers 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.690
 the fact that they will hide this topic 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.900
 story hide from people from this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.260
 the problem will not be solved that is in this 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.510
 situations we would then just come 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.290
 to the fact that there will be great human 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.700
 the victims that is if nothing is done 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.800
 will end much worse each similar 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.350
 the barrel is able to poison everything around in 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.580
 a radius of 40 kilometers, it is clear that thousands 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.710
 containers with mustard 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.930
 threaten the whole Black Sea basin 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.560
 representatives of mechs call for 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.810
 calm 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.610
 I wanted this processor I would not want 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.140
 talk about it on television catch up 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.450
 fear of the inhabitants of Sevastopol and Crimea 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.670
 the problem really is we know where 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.590
 these tanks are located on underwater 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.550
 video frames noticeably some barrels 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.830
 clearly damaged 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.200
 and Kharkov scientific laboratory of military 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.530
 pipeline 43 rule recently study

 dovetail nest excess 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.140
 arsenic content 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.970
 what times above the norm there is technology 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.880
 which allows them to be canned 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.880
 about 700 years given 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.630
 the creation of new large underwater 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.380
 container and submarine transshipment 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.640
 of these small containers 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.120
 old 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.970
 in the new somewhere with 10 pieces and 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.739
 submerged there 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.780
 underwater works go they brew and 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.790
 all reburial technologies 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.830
 chemical weapons are not very complicated and not 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.840
 monstrously road to the same European 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.730
 countries are willing to help financially not 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.800
 lack the courage of leadership 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.290
 Crimea after all by their calculations already through 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.890
 a month and a half is a desert Yalta 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.700
 quay 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.290
