GTR r34 so here's the coke zero 638 and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.140 
GTR r34 so here's the coke zero 638 and
this<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.070> drivetrain<00:04:04.050> coke<00:04:05.050> but<00:04:05.620> I'm<00:04:05.740> not

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
this is the drivetrain coke but I'm not

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.590 
this is the drivetrain coke but I'm not
I'm<00:04:07.150> not<00:04:07.380> replacing<00:04:08.380> with<00:04:08.680> anything<00:04:09.340> cos<00:04:09.730> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
I'm not replacing with anything cos the

I'm not replacing with anything cos the
original<00:04:11.380> s15<00:04:13.710> drivetrain<00:04:14.710> is<00:04:14.920> very<00:04:15.220> well<00:04:15.400> and

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
original s15 drivetrain is very well and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.710 
original s15 drivetrain is very well and
this<00:04:16.420> is<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.930> transmission<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.450> not<00:04:19.450> gonna

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
this is the transmission and not gonna

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.600 
this is the transmission and not gonna
replace<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.880> this<00:04:22.030> car<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.830> then<00:04:23.830> the

replace it to for this car and then the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.670 
replace it to for this car and then the
engine<00:04:25.450> power<00:04:26.230> if<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.220> want<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.470> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
engine power if you want so this is the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.040 
engine power if you want so this is the
engine<00:04:30.280> multiplier<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.900> for<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.170> realistic

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
engine multiplier so for the realistic

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.340 
engine multiplier so for the realistic
engine<00:04:35.050> upgrade<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.910> wanna<00:04:37.210> see<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.140> should

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
engine upgrade you wanna see you should

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.320 
engine upgrade you wanna see you should
replace<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.980> with<00:04:39.780> 0520<00:04:40.780> 9<00:04:41.910> yeah<00:04:42.910> for<00:04:43.210> some

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
replace it with 0520 9 yeah for some

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.050 
replace it with 0520 9 yeah for some
realistic<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:44.230> tuning<00:04:45.930> but<00:04:46.930> if<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.350> want<00:04:47.620> to

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.730 
have maximum power for the car yeah like
over<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.419> million<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.960> some

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
over a million and some

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.249 
over a million and some
like<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.729> should<00:04:54.759> replace<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.960> with<00:04:56.229> F<00:04:56.530> F

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259

car so yeah is two lines above the ng

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:00.749 
car so yeah is two lines above the ng
multiplier<00:05:54.330> here<00:05:56.580> 6e<00:05:59.250> this<00:06:00.250> is<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.520> right

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
multiplier here 6e this is the right
