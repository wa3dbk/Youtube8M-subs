00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.029
 many of the video games that came to the US market from 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.609
 Japan were modified to make them more attractive to the American public 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.869
 as a rule these westernization is consisted of a 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.869
 change in the title in changes in the names of the characters 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.929
 and in a new cover that 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.640
 except for a few exceptions 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.159
 it was worse than the nikon to 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.989
 generally these changes were insignificant compared to the 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.960
 rape suffered by video games based on successful anime series 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.669
 especially in the late 80's and early 90's 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.110
 It is well known that when a manga reaches enough success 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.680
 adapts to an animated series and begins to market varied 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.250
 merchandaising among this merchandaising highlights the video game itself 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.140
 if the companies thought it was worth risking 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.420
 the video game crossed the borders and arrived at the west 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.630
 but along the way you would encounter two problems 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.750
 not on his trip to europe he made a stop in the united states where he suffered 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.540
 important modifications 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.380
 the manga or the animated series had not yet reached outside the borders 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.740
 of the country of the rising sun the success that it would have in the later years 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.030
 me and instead of taking advantage of the game to promote the franchise the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 companies chose to Americanize eliminating any reference to the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.560
 original manga series creating sometimes true nonsense with 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.040
 surrealist tints 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.510
 the videogames that I will announce now are part of that Americanization 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 dragon gol drados mpower dragon boles the manga series by antonomasia 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 the main reference for any mangaka today the kick-off 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 from the bund the anime the bible of every taco worth its salt 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 but even so his first game was spared from falling into the cabbage claws of the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 modifiers 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.320
 celia and burgos are simple little nuns of charity compared to them 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.710
 in the original Japanese game we are told the first saga of the work of 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.340
 toriyama 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.870
 that ranges from when goku knew bulma to his confrontation with the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.830
 evil pirate and the appearance of the dragon sendon 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.300
 from an aerial perspective that becomes lateral at the time of 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.950
 to confront the final bosses we would control Son Goku in his becoming 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.229
 in pursuit of the seven balls of the dragon 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.619
 but being sincere 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.500
 the game itself is not any wonder its graphics are rather modest and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.689
 the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.019
 and surely would have gone unnoticed if it were not the 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.019
 first game of the franchise 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.670
 despite these factors 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.819
 the game was marketed both in Europe and in the United States 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.150
 but luckily for the Europeans the game came without the modification 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.860
 American and simply changed the title alagon came back god in long 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:38.159
 the American version, on the other hand, was a complete aberration 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.000
 to start the game ended up calling himself pauer dragon and in his new 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.349
 cover was the typical karate player wearing his white kimono 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.680
 however this karate player only appeared on the cover 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.810
 since inside the game we were a stranger esprit the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.889
 modified from goku 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.089
 that makes him look more like an ape than human 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:01.129
 but the popular dragon protagonist bonus was the only one to suffer absurd 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.090
 modifications 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.720
 the remaining cast of characters also suffered the changes in their 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.939
 own meats 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.209
 the best example is that of mute en rossi 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.040
 which was replaced by a traditional car and venerable elderly teacher 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.650
 of the martial arts which dressed in a blue robe no longer had livini 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.959
 two you were thinking together about the gunma panties but only 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.289
 dreamed of simple sandwiches 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:27.179
 they also changed the dragon balls for crystal balls the music of the 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.620
 game 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.390
 the name of gunma by nora 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.319
 the name of llalanza by lancer 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.849
 colon was called pude dicte cetera tecmo cup 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.109
 oliver and benji some super elite soccer stars like fernando 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.929
 towers admitted to be great fans of the series 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.989
 few reached that goal except in relation to throwing shreds shatters 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:45.510
 steps 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.840
 hit a higher height than the stadium itself and run without stopping 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.539
 eternal distances 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:54.619
 however but most mortals the thermos cup was one of the 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:58.439
 games that gave us the opportunity to become an oliver and proclaim ourselves 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.939
 world champions pretty much 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.400
 far from what the fifa of the time offered 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.470
 the games of tecmo tried to transfer all the emotion and intensity of the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.799
 original series to the field leaving aside the realism 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.930
 for that reason they created a strange mixture between the football r pg and certain 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.459
 Real-time strategy elements 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.310
 the matches will be developed through cinematic scenes in which 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.360
 could see when playing the course and at the time wanted or in the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.199
 that a rival would block us 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.680
 it was decided what to do since everything works through menus 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.850
 although it may seem strange and confusing when it comes to playing the truth is that it is very 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.120
 easy to control and such is it that it became a formula that 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.919
 guaranteed success and would be repeated in later 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.999
 video games based on calp tain its trump card 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.830
 Given the characteristics of the game, let's talk about its Americanization 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.819
 the guys from tecmo decided to launch the game to the western market 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.180
 that the series on which it was based was triumphing in half the world 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.229
 but unfortunately the game before reaching Europe fell into the hands of the Americas 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.770
 in the United States football is not a very popular sport 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.020
 and therefore the series captures in his house was hardly known by the Yankees 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.680
 They then decided to modify practically all the graphs of the 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 game and by redesigning all the faces of the protagonists 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.460
 any reference to the takahashi series was eliminated 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.390
 and the game ended up being starred by an insipid blond character who did not 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.520
 did something other than make the product less attractive 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.150
 only the sportscaster and the referee were saved from burning 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.909
 As expected, when players change their appearance, they have to be changed 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.580
 also the names and the history so that this one makes some sense 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.340
 so oliver aton happened to be called robin faithful 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.230
 a young promise of football that wants to become a superstar of the 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.000
 football just like his father was in the original version is nothing more 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.919
 and nothing less than roberto cervino 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.669
 for it is aimed at a newly formed football team called the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.560
 level times I love you hawks according to the version with the intention of competing 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.819
 against other teams in the country to win the championship 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.599
 once the goal has been achieved and it becomes the conquest of the cup of 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:05.580
 world 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.590
 at the arrival of the game europe 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.500
 where the series did enjoy success 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.130
 it was clear that the game was based on captain tsubasa by many 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.699
 modifications and changes that Americans would have made 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.469
 it was easy to see the similarities between for example 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.340
 damon and mark lenders caught and uga the dieese and edwar merken muatassim to his 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.939
 office brother of robin in this version and tom baker taro misaki 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:30.899
 It was also appreciated that at that time it was one of the few games of 

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:34.710
 translated into Spanish, which earned him points and increased his 

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:35.639
 popularity 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.169
 although sometimes you also found with some other translation error 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.939
 this photo is that of bruce harper americanized 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:46.939
 finally say that the techno cup can be considered a game of extremes 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.749
 since you like it a lot or nothing 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:51.899
 there is no middle ground and the reasons are several 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.449
 not his strange game system already commented did not go far enough in the 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.499
 gamer community 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.809
 the high difficulty of the title 

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.119
 there were filler goalkeepers that stopped even the super shots 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.059
 the very long and complicated passwords 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.909
 an error in the copy of it forced you to repeat the previous game 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.840
 and if you were wrong copying the previous one because it forced you to repeat two 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.039
 and so on indefinitely to start the championship again from scratch 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.189
 write the password well and the first one caused a sensation similar to the 

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:24.589
 to win a match 

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:26.979
 I'm going to do a second part of this topic 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.909
 so stay tuned to my channel and kuyt hoops 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.129
 I am mayagüez home 6 greetings
