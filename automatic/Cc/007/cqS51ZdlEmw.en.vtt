00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
now what I've done is I took our board

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.390 
now what I've done is I took our board
and<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.450> made<00:02:25.720> some<00:02:25.990> chalk<00:02:26.260> marks<00:02:26.710> going<00:02:27.100> all

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
and I made some chalk marks going all

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880 
and I made some chalk marks going all
the<00:02:27.610> way<00:02:27.640> down<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.840> board<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.470> way<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.710> know

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the way down the board that way I know

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.940 
the way down the board that way I know
exactly<00:02:30.040> where<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> need<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.630> place<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.650> mail

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
sorters on the front so the way that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.810 
sorters on the front so the way that
we're<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.530> put<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:35.830> together<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.550> with

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
we're going to put this together is with

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.370 
we're going to put this together is with
some<00:02:37.120> wood<00:02:37.300> glue<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.570> then<00:02:37.930> we're<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.080> going

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
some wood glue and then we're just going

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.080 
some wood glue and then we're just going
to<00:02:38.410> attach<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.130> nails<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.760> did<00:02:39.940> before

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
to attach the nails like we did before

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.880 
to attach the nails like we did before
so<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:41.380> little<00:02:41.650> wood<00:02:41.950> glue<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.490> both<00:02:42.850> sides<00:02:43.890> line

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
so a little wood glue on both sides line

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.950 
so a little wood glue on both sides line
the<00:02:45.070> slot<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.520> with<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.970> chalk<00:02:46.300> mark<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.840> we

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
the slot up with the chalk mark that we

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.830 
the slot up with the chalk mark that we
made<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.530> then<00:02:48.340> turn<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.820> piece<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.300> its<00:02:49.570> side

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
made and then turn the piece on its side

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.160 
made and then turn the piece on its side
a<00:02:50.200> couple<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.040> nails<00:02:51.280> through<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> back

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
a couple of nails through the back

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.780 
a couple of nails through the back
should<00:02:53.170> reinforce<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:54.010> we're<00:02:54.400> going<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.550> do

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
should reinforce it we're going to do

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.780 
should reinforce it we're going to do
this<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.210> both<00:02:55.480> sides<00:02:55.540> nice<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.770> sturdy<00:02:57.100> all

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
this on both sides nice and sturdy all

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.490 
this on both sides nice and sturdy all
right<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.390> we're<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.960> work<00:02:59.140> our<00:02:59.350> way

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
right so we're going to work our way

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.820 
right so we're going to work our way
down

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
down

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.730 
down
attaching<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.640> other<00:03:00.850> two<00:03:01.240> points<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:02.530> last

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
attaching the other two points the last

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.860 
attaching the other two points the last
step<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.400> add<00:03:03.700> some<00:03:03.730> hooks<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.630> bottom

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
step is to add some hooks to the bottom

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.320 
step is to add some hooks to the bottom
so<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:05.530> can<00:03:05.560> use<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.220> keys<00:03:06.490> or<00:03:06.940> maybe<00:03:07.180> a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
so we can use that for keys or maybe a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.380 
so we can use that for keys or maybe a
dog<00:03:07.660> leash<00:03:07.930> if<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.410> have<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> puppy<00:03:09.390> I've

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
dog leash if you have a puppy I've

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.000 
dog leash if you have a puppy I've
already<00:03:10.750> gone<00:03:10.900> through<00:03:10.960> these<00:03:11.500> are<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.770> hooks

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
already gone through these are the hooks

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.830 
already gone through these are the hooks
that<00:03:12.220> we're<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:12.730> attaching<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.660> so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that we're going to be attaching and so

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.870 
that we're going to be attaching and so
I've<00:03:14.080> just<00:03:14.400> guesstimated<00:03:15.400> where<00:03:15.580> I'm<00:03:15.700> going

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
I've just guesstimated where I'm going

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.490 
I've just guesstimated where I'm going
to<00:03:15.940> place<00:03:16.150> them<00:03:16.390> I'm<00:03:16.600> not<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:16.990> a<00:03:17.110> measurer

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
to place them I'm not really a measurer

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.680 
to place them I'm not really a measurer
and<00:03:17.800> then<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.400> went<00:03:18.700> through<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.240> I<00:03:19.330> marked

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
and then I went through and I marked

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.020 
and then I went through and I marked
them<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.050> pencil<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.580> put<00:03:21.790> them<00:03:21.880> in

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
them with a pencil so I just put them in

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.790 
them with a pencil so I just put them in
place<00:03:22.270> I<00:03:22.600> marked<00:03:23.020> some<00:03:23.230> circles<00:03:23.620> with<00:03:23.770> a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
place I marked some circles with a

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.620 
place I marked some circles with a
pencil<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.520> then<00:03:24.910> I'm<00:03:25.030> going<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.240> drill<00:03:25.480> some

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
pencil and then I'm going to drill some

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.390 
pencil and then I'm going to drill some
pilot<00:03:25.690> holes<00:03:26.110> in<00:03:26.560> there<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.980> get<00:03:27.100> us<00:03:27.160> started

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
pilot holes in there to get us started

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.420 
pilot holes in there to get us started
and<00:03:27.880> once<00:03:28.750> our<00:03:28.930> pilot<00:03:29.350> holes<00:03:29.590> are<00:03:29.800> done<00:03:30.010> we're

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
and once our pilot holes are done we're

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.550 
and once our pilot holes are done we're
going<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.610> screw<00:03:31.000> our<00:03:31.180> three<00:03:31.660> hooks<00:03:31.959> into

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
going to screw our three hooks into

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.870 
going to screw our three hooks into
place<00:03:32.800> all<00:03:33.760> right<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:35.290> now<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:36.220> are<00:03:36.459> finished

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
place all right and now we are finished

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.199 
place all right and now we are finished
so<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.020> very<00:03:38.680> easy<00:03:38.800> build<00:03:39.520> a<00:03:39.760> mail

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
so this is a very easy build a mail

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.760
