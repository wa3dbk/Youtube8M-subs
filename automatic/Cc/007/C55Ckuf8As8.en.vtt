00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.160
The dream I yearned for since I was a child

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:19.180
Imprisoned me, like a labyrinth…

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.180
By the time I became aware of the disappearing door,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:54.200
I could no longer return, for eternity.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:06.860
I search for that key, which I lost somewhere,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:19.160
Without recalling what I felt at the start…

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.120
During the night, with a moon

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180
(The mist cleared up on this night.)
During the night, with a moon

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.620
(The mist cleared up on this night.)

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.400
As beautiful as this, we are alone together.
(The mist cleared up on this night.)

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.920
As beautiful as this, we are alone together.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.700
(It is our dream – one of a blizzard of cherry blossoms.)
As beautiful as this, we are alone together.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.380
(It is our dream – one of a blizzard of cherry blossoms.)

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.100
We race through the town, chasing a dream,
(It is our dream – one of a blizzard of cherry blossoms.)

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.440
We race through the town, chasing a dream,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.440
(We crossed over the eternal night…)
We race through the town, chasing a dream,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.400
(We crossed over the eternal night…)

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.820
Following the unknown towards that bewitching knowledge.
(We crossed over the eternal night…)

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.280
Following the unknown towards that bewitching knowledge.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.500
(Chasing after illusions.)
Following the unknown towards that bewitching knowledge.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.300
(Chasing after illusions.)

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.240
Because even my memories
(Chasing after illusions.)

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.900
Because even my memories

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.820
Have rusted, little by little…

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.680
I bid you goodbye, until the day we can meet again,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.380
In this miracle I cannot awaken from.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.900
The black stars that stained the night sky

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:48.760
Are like the moon, which still illuminates my heart.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.060
I walk along a path, the exit of which I cannot see,
Are like the moon, which still illuminates my heart.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:01.420
I walk along a path, the exit of which I cannot see,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:13.840
And I continue to search for what I felt at the start.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.720
During this night, as well, with stars

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.480
(The wind does not blow during this night.)

As beautiful as this, we are alone together.
(The wind does not blow during this night.)

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.380
As beautiful as this, we are alone together.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.120
(It, too, is our dream – one we have when we close our eyes.)
As beautiful as this, we are alone together.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.900
(It, too, is our dream – one we have when we close our eyes.)

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.740
We chase a forgotten dream,
(It, too, is our dream – one we have when we close our eyes.)

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.060
We chase a forgotten dream,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.780
(We crossed over the limitless ocean…)
We chase a forgotten dream,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.640
(We crossed over the limitless ocean…)

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.320
Following the unknown towards that bewitching knowledge.
(We crossed over the limitless ocean…)

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.820
Following the unknown towards that bewitching knowledge.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940
(Chasing after illusions.)
Following the unknown towards that bewitching knowledge.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.880
(Chasing after illusions.)

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.680
Because even my love
(Chasing after illusions.)

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.400
Because even my love

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.320
Has faded away, little by little…

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.940
I bade you goodbye, until that night,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.580
When those two met…
