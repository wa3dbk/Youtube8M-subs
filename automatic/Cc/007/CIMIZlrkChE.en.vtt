do anything at all so I brought up the
steam<00:02:06.050> overlay<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.800> well<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.220> community

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
steam overlay as well the community

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.840 
steam overlay as well the community
overlay<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:09.140> know<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.410> shift<00:02:09.649> tab<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.820> I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
overlay you know the shift tab then I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.590 
overlay you know the shift tab then I
think<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.540> when<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.470> had<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.250> alt-tab<00:02:14.150> alt

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
think I when I had that up I alt-tab alt

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.500 
think I when I had that up I alt-tab alt
tab<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.350> well<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.970> might<00:02:17.180> have<00:02:17.330> something

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
tab as well so that might have something

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.070 
tab as well so that might have something
to<00:02:17.690> do<00:02:17.930> with<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.910> may<00:02:19.910> at<00:02:20.150> some<00:02:20.420> point<00:02:20.930> have

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
to do with it I may at some point have

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.350 
to do with it I may at some point have
minimized<00:02:21.680> my<00:02:21.830> game<00:02:23.440> also<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:25.580> did<00:02:25.910> restart

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
minimized my game also I did restart

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.040 
minimized my game also I did restart

you as you can tell like while I'm while
the<00:02:57.140> monsters<00:02:57.470> are<00:02:57.560> dying<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.980> game<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.519> still

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the monsters are dying the game is still

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.030 
the monsters are dying the game is still
running<00:02:58.880> i'm<00:02:59.150> still<00:02:59.390> getting<00:02:59.570> all<00:02:59.810> these

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
running i'm still getting all these

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.910 
running i'm still getting all these
bonus<00:03:01.040> drops<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.580> everything<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.000> that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
bonus drops and everything like that

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.199 
bonus drops and everything like that
it's<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.340> monsters<00:03:04.730> don't<00:03:04.880> spawn

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
it's just that the monsters don't spawn

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:13.720 
it's just that the monsters don't spawn
which<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.170> absurd<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:06.920> still<00:03:07.100> weird

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.540 

yeah<00:03:14.990> so<00:03:15.990> for<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> last<00:03:16.320> way<00:03:16.830> if<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> monsters

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
yeah so for the last way if the monsters

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.330 
yeah so for the last way if the monsters
do<00:03:17.790> spawned<00:03:18.120> though<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.770> was<00:03:19.980> really

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
do spawned though but that was really

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.450 
do spawned though but that was really
easy<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:21.360> because<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.990> had<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.160> much<00:03:23.250> money

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
easy to do because I had so much money

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.340 
easy to do because I had so much money
racked<00:03:23.790> up<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.300> having<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.020> kill<00:03:25.170> any

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
racked up for not having to kill any

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.530 
racked up for not having to kill any
monsters<00:03:25.680> beforehand<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.310> i<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.670> did

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
monsters beforehand so i just did

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.060 
monsters beforehand so i just did
whatever<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.870> wanted<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.260> here<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.709> monsters

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
whatever I wanted so here the monsters

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.730 
whatever I wanted so here the monsters
are<00:03:29.160> spawning<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:29.670> for<00:03:30.060> some<00:03:30.180> reason<00:03:30.330> and

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
are spawning now for some reason and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.520 
are spawning now for some reason and
it's<00:03:31.740> at<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.950> last<00:03:32.160> wave<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.320> going<00:03:34.440> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
it's at the last wave so it's going to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.590 
it's at the last wave so it's going to
be<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> last<00:03:34.830> wave<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.430> has<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.000> last<00:03:36.180> ultra

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
be the last wave that has the last ultra

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.309 
be the last wave that has the last ultra
