00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
Australia I think it's a little bit

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.830 
Australia I think it's a little bit
better<00:03:49.850> than<00:03:50.030> Budweiser<00:03:50.630> actually<00:03:51.230> Oh<00:03:52.570> Miller

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
better than Budweiser actually Oh Miller

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.740 
better than Budweiser actually Oh Miller
for<00:03:53.990> that<00:03:54.110> matter<00:03:55.120> yeah<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.390> probably<00:03:56.480> been

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
for that matter yeah it's probably been

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.380 
for that matter yeah it's probably been
too<00:03:56.959> long<00:03:57.200> since<00:03:57.260> I've<00:03:57.830> tried<00:03:58.430> causal<00:03:59.060> Schlitz

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
too long since I've tried causal Schlitz

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.110 
too long since I've tried causal Schlitz
to<00:03:59.780> you<00:04:00.620> really<00:04:00.950> make<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.130> fair<00:04:01.430> judgment<00:04:01.459> yeah

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
but it's not only a little bit better

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.449
