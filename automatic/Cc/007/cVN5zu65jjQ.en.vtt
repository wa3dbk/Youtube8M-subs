beginning move called a Nara bong
basically<00:00:24.190> what<00:00:24.340> this<00:00:24.520> move<00:00:24.700> is<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:25.210> combines

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
tornado kick and a spinning hook to

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.080 
tornado kick and a spinning hook to
create<00:00:28.810> something<00:00:29.260> totally<00:00:29.890> different<00:00:30.190> so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
create something totally different so

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.519 
create something totally different so
I'm<00:00:31.180> going<00:00:31.360> to<00:00:31.420> break<00:00:31.570> this<00:00:31.750> up<00:00:31.810> in<00:00:32.140> steps

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529

bit faster as well so first we're going
to<00:00:38.290> be<00:00:38.350> starting<00:00:38.620> with<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.770> skip<00:00:39.010> hook<00:00:39.220> then

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
to be starting with a skip hook then

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.440 
to be starting with a skip hook then
from<00:00:39.760> there<00:00:39.910> we're<00:00:40.000> going<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.180> learn<00:00:40.270> an

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
from there we're going to learn an

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.190 
from there we're going to learn an
Autobahn

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
Autobahn

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.290 
Autobahn
then<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.800> certain<00:00:42.040> Arbonne<00:00:42.370> let's<00:00:43.060> check<00:00:43.210> it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
then on certain Arbonne let's check it

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.170 
then on certain Arbonne let's check it
out<00:00:43.360> guys

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 

alright<00:00:49.020> guys<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.230> step<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> be

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
alright guys so step one is going to be

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.020 
alright guys so step one is going to be
getting<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> skip<00:00:50.789> hook<00:00:51.059> down

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
getting the skip hook down

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
getting the skip hook down
we<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.210> use<00:00:54.420> any<00:00:54.449> cheat<00:00:55.019> setup<00:00:55.410> nothing

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we don't use any cheat setup nothing

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
we don't use any cheat setup nothing
like<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:56.879> doing<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.300> we're

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
like that all what we're doing is we're

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
like that all what we're doing is we're
going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> start<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.110> right<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.739> we're

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
going to start from right here and we're

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
going to start from right here and we're
going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.339> skip<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.910> knee<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.170> from

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
going to skip this knee up and then from

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.470 
going to skip this knee up and then from
here<00:01:01.769> we're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> bring<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
here we're going to bring it in and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.139 
here we're going to bring it in and
throw<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> hook<00:01:04.259> kick<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.880> you<00:01:05.880> want<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
throw a hook kick if you want to

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.120 
throw a hook kick if you want to
simplify<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.770> kind<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
simplify it a little bit it's kind of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.550 
simplify it a little bit it's kind of
like<00:01:08.280> you're<00:01:08.520> doing<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.060> spin<00:01:09.869> hook<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.320> here

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
like you're doing a spin hook right here

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.370 
like you're doing a spin hook right here
and<00:01:10.830> throwing<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:12.180> instead<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> stepping

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and throwing out but instead of stepping

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.680 
and throwing out but instead of stepping
over<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:14.399> bringing<00:01:14.759> this<00:01:14.850> knee<00:01:15.030> straight

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
over we're bringing this knee straight

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.310 
over we're bringing this knee straight
up<00:01:15.840> skipping<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:18.420> throwing<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.899> ok<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
up skipping and then throwing it ok so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.490 
up skipping and then throwing it ok so
that's<00:01:20.130> basically<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.869> I'll<00:01:22.170> slow<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that's basically all it is I'll slow it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
that's basically all it is I'll slow it
down<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> real<00:01:23.130> quick<00:01:23.190> so<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.550> guys<00:01:23.759> can

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
step over now instead of just throwing

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.770 
step over now instead of just throwing
the<00:01:49.609> hook<00:01:49.759> out<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:50.569> we're<00:01:50.659> going

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the hook out like that what we're going

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.849 
the hook out like that what we're going
to<00:01:50.840> do<00:01:50.959> is<00:01:51.079> we're<00:01:51.170> going<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.319> pump<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.709> like<00:01:51.799> a

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
to do is we're going to pump it like a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.130 
to do is we're going to pump it like a
tornado<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.939> we're<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.209> to<00:01:53.270> pump<00:01:53.959> it<00:01:54.109> right

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
tornado so we're going to pump it right

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.050 
tornado so we're going to pump it right
here<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.679> tornado<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.429> we're<00:01:55.909> going<00:01:56.030> to

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
is go to skip and hook out like that ok

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.839 
is go to skip and hook out like that ok
that's<00:02:03.229> an<00:02:03.380> Autobahn<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:03.979> let<00:02:04.759> me

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
that's an Autobahn and let me

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.819 
that's an Autobahn and let me

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
remember cheat set up step over pump act

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.369 
remember cheat set up step over pump act
like<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.540> get<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> tornado<00:02:14.900> fake<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.129> then

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
like you get a tornado fake it and then

like you get a tornado fake it and then
throw<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.530> hook<00:02:18.709> I'll<00:02:19.010> slow<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.280> down<00:02:19.430> for

alright guys so now that we got the
autobahn<00:02:33.379> down<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.920> Skip<00:02:34.189> Hook<00:02:34.370> down<00:02:34.549> we're

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
autobahn down the Skip Hook down we're

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.589 
autobahn down the Skip Hook down we're
going<00:02:35.359> to<00:02:35.480> do<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.620> Narbonne<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:38.239> we<00:02:38.480> got

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
going to do the Narbonne so if we got

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.449 
going to do the Narbonne so if we got
the<00:02:38.689> autobahn<00:02:39.019> down<00:02:39.260> good<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:40.040> this

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
the autobahn down good then this

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.580 
the autobahn down good then this
shouldn't<00:02:40.790> be<00:02:40.849> too<00:02:41.120> difficult<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.780> all<00:02:41.810> what

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
shouldn't be too difficult at all what

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.110 
shouldn't be too difficult at all what
you're<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.189> to<00:02:43.219> do<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.700> we're<00:02:43.879> going<00:02:43.969> to<00:02:44.060> do

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
same thing as skip hoof but are not skip

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.390 
same thing as skip hoof but are not skip
hook<00:02:47.150> but<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.359> Autobahn<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.439> when<00:02:49.099> we<00:02:49.189> come

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
hook but a Autobahn and when we come

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.459 
hook but a Autobahn and when we come
around<00:02:49.519> right<00:02:49.790> here<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.599> you<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.319> how<00:02:51.409> we

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:51.469 
around right here and you know how we

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.679 
around right here and you know how we
normally<00:02:51.980> skip<00:02:52.370> up<00:02:52.549> and<00:02:52.790> then<00:02:52.969> hook<00:02:53.180> what

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
normally skip up and then hook what

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:54.490 
normally skip up and then hook what
we're<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:53.989> do<00:02:54.109> is<00:02:54.260> we're<00:02:54.349> going<00:02:54.379> to

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.129 
we're going to do is we're going to
throw<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.980> roundhouse<00:02:55.489> kick<00:02:55.639> okay<00:02:56.209> it's

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
throw a roundhouse kick okay it's

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.709 
throw a roundhouse kick okay it's
important<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:58.099> not<00:02:58.280> treat<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.209> move<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.689> a

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
important to not treat this move like a

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.420 
important to not treat this move like a
tornado<00:03:00.109> because<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.920> do<00:03:01.099> then<00:03:01.340> you're

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
tornado because if you do then you're

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.949 
tornado because if you do then you're
just<00:03:01.519> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> go<00:03:01.849> tornado<00:03:02.269> kick<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.750> then

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
just going to go tornado kick and then

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.349 
just going to go tornado kick and then
hook<00:03:03.169> you<00:03:03.919> want<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.189> think<00:03:04.370> about<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.760> as<00:03:04.970> a

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
hook you want to think about it as a

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.470 
hook you want to think about it as a
roundhouse<00:03:06.109> snapping<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.129> out<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.579> can<00:03:08.269> bring

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
roundhouse snapping it out and can bring

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.240 
roundhouse snapping it out and can bring
you<00:03:08.629> back<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.260> then<00:03:09.680> throwing<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.129> hook

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
you back in and then throwing the hook

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.309 
you back in and then throwing the hook
make<00:03:10.790> sure<00:03:10.939> you're<00:03:11.090> coming<00:03:11.239> here<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.930> set<00:03:12.139> it

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
make sure you're coming here to set it

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.839 
make sure you're coming here to set it
step<00:03:12.980> over<00:03:13.629> pump<00:03:14.709> now<00:03:15.709> you're<00:03:15.889> going<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.099> snap

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
step over pump now you're going to snap

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.339 
step over pump now you're going to snap
chamber<00:03:17.780> then<00:03:18.319> hook<00:03:18.669> like<00:03:19.669> that<00:03:19.879> okay<00:03:20.870> now

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
chamber then hook like that okay now

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.959 
chamber then hook like that okay now
once<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.680> get<00:03:21.829> used<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.159> doing<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.549> and

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
once you get used to doing that and

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.119 
once you get used to doing that and
chambering<00:03:23.419> it<00:03:23.569> if<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.319> want<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.980> can

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
chambering it if you want to you can

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.610 
chambering it if you want to you can
kind<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.579> boom<00:03:25.969> let<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.359> go<00:03:26.510> out<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:26.930> then

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
kind of just boom let it go out and then

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.839 
kind of just boom let it go out and then
hook<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.159> you<00:03:28.310> don't<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.579> have<00:03:28.730> to

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
hook and you don't really have to

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.119 
hook and you don't really have to
chamber<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.299> as<00:03:29.450> much<00:03:29.629> but<00:03:30.409> for<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:30.950> guys

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
on doing a roundhouse snapping it out

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.809 
on doing a roundhouse snapping it out
chambering<00:03:39.169> it<00:03:39.290> back<00:03:39.409> in<00:03:39.590> putting<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.669> down
