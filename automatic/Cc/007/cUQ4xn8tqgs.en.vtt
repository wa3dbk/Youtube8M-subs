00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.170
 free the first operation to be performed 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.360
 happens on the wire destined to be or 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.850
 then write the braided nylon 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 of larger diameter and we will carry out a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.699
 very bad knot 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.699
 exactly like this one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.900
 now we're going to get the mother thread 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900
 starts badly 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.210
 we will simply have to enter the line 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.380
 mother inside the little knot that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.990
 we have created which in turn 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.980
 andrea closed but not particularly 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.510
 strict 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.410
 in this way the option more 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 traditional consists in keeping open 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.079
 a small loop with a finger and wrap 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.259
 the mother line several times at least 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:12.420
 five or six around the shock leader 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:17.150
 to then return at least three times towards 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.150
 the loop back 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 this is the final position 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 which we will obviously go to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.040
 insert the small loop into the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.360
 our show creed and if we wanted to 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.360
 even a second time 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.250
 here we are 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.180
 we arrived at the closing part 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 in the knot again it is a lot 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.490
 important to close slowly 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.590
 verifying that the fibers are disputed in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.500
 neat way without overlapping since 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.869
 this would surely be ad 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.130
 negatively affect the estate 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.130
 of our note 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:22.060
 at this point the node is completed 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 the important in this way and the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:31.100
 conical structure that knows that allows a 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.810
 exit smoothly from the rings of the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.709
 cancer obviously we are going to cut 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.709
 the excess parts 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.660
 the knot is extremely clean 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.720
 extremely reliable to the point from 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.660
 be used by practically everyone 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.940
 even lovers of surf casting 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.940
 for its power and endurance 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.390
 no the shock leader
