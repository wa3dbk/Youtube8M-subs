00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this video there's one major problem

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.289 
this video there's one major problem
with<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> case<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.549> slim<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
with this case it's pretty slim and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.810 
with this case it's pretty slim and
works<00:01:36.509> well<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.500> flap<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.280> gets<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
works well but this flap just gets in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.609 
works well but this flap just gets in
the<00:01:38.939> way<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.630> no<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the way there's really no good way to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.069 
the way there's really no good way to
fold<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> back<00:01:41.460> behind<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.090> phone<00:01:42.299> without<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
fold it back behind the phone without it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.469 
fold it back behind the phone without it
being<00:01:43.200> awkward<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.950> popping<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:44.909> anything

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
being awkward or popping out or anything

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.170 
being awkward or popping out or anything
like<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.409> disrupts<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> use<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
like that it really disrupts the use of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.550 
like that it really disrupts the use of
the<00:01:48.360> phone<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.930> I'll<00:01:49.020> show<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.500> about

the flap does tend to get in the way it

the flap does tend to get in the way it
actually<00:03:14.040> completely<00:03:14.579> cripples<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.349 
one-handed usability of the HTC One m8

quickly without having to worry about
putting<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.299> behind<00:03:27.449> there<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:27.900> even<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.560> that

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
putting it behind there but even at that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.159 
putting it behind there but even at that
it<00:03:28.949> makes<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.519> very<00:03:29.639> awkward<00:03:29.909> to<00:03:30.419> type<00:03:30.720> because

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
it makes it very awkward to type because

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.199 
it makes it very awkward to type because
unless<00:03:31.319> you're<00:03:31.620> pushing<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.220> flat<00:03:32.819> against

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
unless you're pushing it flat against

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
the back of the phone it's gonna kind of

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.009 
the back of the phone it's gonna kind of
bounce<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.609> your<00:03:35.639> hand<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:36.690> found

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
bounce in your hand and I just found

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.080 
bounce in your hand and I just found
that<00:03:37.199> to<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.290> annoying<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.310> mention<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that to be annoying not to mention the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.360 
that to be annoying not to mention the
camera<00:03:39.720> issues<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.440> run<00:03:40.650> into<00:03:40.919> like

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
camera issues that you run into like

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.399 
camera issues that you run into like
this<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:41.909> so<00:03:42.479> that<00:03:42.629> kind<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.870> requires<00:03:43.199> you<00:03:43.379> to

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
this and so that kind of requires you to

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.649 
this and so that kind of requires you to
let<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.680> hang<00:03:43.979> down<00:03:44.310> while<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.359> take<00:03:45.629> a

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
let it hang down while you take a

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.140 
let it hang down while you take a
picture<00:03:46.169> which<00:03:46.409> again<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.859> very<00:03:47.760> very

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
picture which again is very very

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.909 
picture which again is very very
annoying<00:03:48.479> now<00:03:48.840> one<00:03:49.019> thing<00:03:49.199> I<00:03:49.349> did<00:03:49.530> figure<00:03:49.769> out

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
annoying now one thing I did figure out

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.339 
annoying now one thing I did figure out
is<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.970> magnet<00:03:51.569> placement<00:03:52.079> that

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
is that the magnet placement that

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.469 
is that the magnet placement that
enables<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.159> functionality<00:03:53.699> is<00:03:53.970> located

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
enables this functionality is located

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.849 
enables this functionality is located
right<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.840> center<00:03:55.019> there<00:03:55.349> on<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> left

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
right in the center there on the left

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.860 
right in the center there on the left
side<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.250> device<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.699> this<00:03:57.359> lets<00:03:57.629> me<00:03:57.840> know

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
side of the device so this lets me know

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.920 
side of the device so this lets me know
that<00:03:58.290> we<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.040> possibility<00:03:59.340> of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
that we do have the possibility of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.770 
that we do have the possibility of
third-party<00:04:01.129> HTC<00:04:02.129> One<00:04:02.430> dot<00:04:02.790> view<00:04:03.030> cases<00:04:03.569> in

third-party HTC One dot view cases in

third-party HTC One dot view cases in
the<00:04:03.959> future<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.739> will<00:04:04.859> maybe<00:04:05.010> be<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.280> bit

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
the future that will maybe be a bit

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.819 
the future that will maybe be a bit
cheaper<00:04:05.849> than<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.150> $50<00:04:06.659> asking<00:04:07.199> price<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.680> the

cheaper than the $50 asking price of the

cheaper than the $50 asking price of the
official<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.430> another<00:04:08.760> thing<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.090> noticed

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
official one another thing I noticed

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.089 
official one another thing I noticed
when<00:04:09.569> using<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.019> dot<00:04:10.199> view<00:04:10.379> case<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:10.979> the

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
when using the dot view case is that the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.649 
when using the dot view case is that the
device<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.549> screen<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:11.970> actually<00:04:12.150> pushing

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
device the screen is actually pushing

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.420 
device the screen is actually pushing
out<00:04:12.780> full<00:04:13.049> brightness<00:04:13.409> in<00:04:13.829> order<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.159> shine

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
out full brightness in order to shine

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.920 
out full brightness in order to shine
that<00:04:14.669> pattern<00:04:15.060> through<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.419> holes<00:04:15.599> on<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
that pattern through the holes on the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.110 
that pattern through the holes on the
case<00:04:16.139> now<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:16.859> can<00:04:17.070> actually<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.579> problem

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
case now this can actually be a problem

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.719 
case now this can actually be a problem
because<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.720> m8<00:04:19.109> does<00:04:19.560> not<00:04:19.799> have<00:04:20.130> an<00:04:20.280> AMOLED

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
because the m8 does not have an AMOLED

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.640 
because the m8 does not have an AMOLED
display<00:04:21.090> which<00:04:21.539> would<00:04:21.719> help<00:04:21.870> conserve<00:04:22.440> its

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
display which would help conserve its

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.860 
display which would help conserve its
battery<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.159> similar<00:04:23.490> situation<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.510> did

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
battery in a similar situation if it did

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.990 
battery in a similar situation if it did
I<00:04:25.139> noticed<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.680> because<00:04:26.130> when<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.460> open

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
I noticed this because when I open

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.090 
I noticed this because when I open
the<00:04:27.090> flap<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.630> brightness<00:04:28.080> would<00:04:28.320> return<00:04:28.740> to

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
the flap the brightness would return to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.580 
the flap the brightness would return to
its<00:04:29.280> normal<00:04:29.580> level<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:31.200> could<00:04:31.410> be<00:04:31.440> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
its normal level and this could be a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.040 
its normal level and this could be a
problem<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.190> could<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.490> wasting<00:04:33.060> battery<00:04:33.300> more

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
problem it could be wasting battery more

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.750 
problem it could be wasting battery more
than<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.470> as<00:04:34.590> saving<00:04:34.830> I'm<00:04:35.100> almost<00:04:35.430> certain

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
than it as saving I'm almost certain

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.880 
than it as saving I'm almost certain
that<00:04:35.970> it's<00:04:36.150> not<00:04:36.300> saving<00:04:36.840> battery<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.410> because

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
that it's not saving battery and because

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.010 
that it's not saving battery and because
it<00:04:38.040> doesn't<00:04:38.190> add<00:04:38.430> any<00:04:38.640> extra<00:04:39.020> functionality

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
it doesn't add any extra functionality

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.900 
it doesn't add any extra functionality
to<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.440> phone<00:04:40.740> itself<00:04:41.130> other<00:04:41.400> than<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.610> cool
