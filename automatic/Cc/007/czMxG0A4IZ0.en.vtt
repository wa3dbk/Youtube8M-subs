00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 had imposed 5 to 0 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.910
 a taste of revenge must undoubtedly 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.110
 to live in Toulouse who take 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 more points outside that at 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
 spectacular victory 3 to 2 against 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.640
 reims after being led 2 to 0 and the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.220
 Toulouse less than a quarter of an hour 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 game and the Rennes will try to 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.670
 react immediately with this strike 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.310
 distant zechariah butcher was embarrassed a 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 lack of visibility and fled by 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.920
 serge get a free kick 1 to go 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.229

 clement chantôme the first goal of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.439
 clement chantôme with the colors of the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 tfc is he the player on loan from psg 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.600
 the free kick is diverted and costil is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.680
 beat 2 to 0 for toulouse 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 at half time 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 and Rennes will have to react 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.450
 absolutely them that gets closer to more 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.220
 in addition to dangerously from the area of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.720
 relegation 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.000
 the center of alessandrini the candle 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.070
 poorly negotiated by zechariah butcher and the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.980
 reduction of the signed nelson score 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.660
 Oliveira twenty minutes from the end the 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.730
 goal of Portuguese who had just done his 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.110
 come into play 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.710
 it was twelve matches that he had 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.650
 more marked but sounds to the liberator author 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.600
 two goals in the first leg but the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.900
 Toulouse will give themselves a little more 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 air 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.120
 four minutes later with this goal of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.550
 serge aurier far too lax 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.140
 in Rennes defense there are 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.300
 bathed in air had plenty of time to 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.570
 shift on the right side serge aurier 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.880
 author of five goals and six assists 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.060
 decisive it is the most defender 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.970
 prolific of all europe 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 3 mu 1 1 for Toulouse and three 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.300
 museums of this match is completely crazy 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.330
 two minutes from the end their tour 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.120
 alessandrini is poorly negotiated by 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.660
 zachariah butcher and it's abdoulaye 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.880
 doucouré which marks the goal of 3 to 2 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.590
 Toulouse has a goal advantage 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.560
 but the Rennes alarm clock will be too late 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.090
 the tfc wins 3 to 2 third victory 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.170
 consecutive for Toulouse who 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.950
 could feed ambitions 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.020
 European 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.709
 while that of Rennes is orientated 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.709
 towards maintaining
