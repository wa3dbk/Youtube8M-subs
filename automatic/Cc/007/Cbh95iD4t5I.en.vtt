00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.019
 Well, if I bring you a great game that is the 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:15.519
 supreme commander one that is not the force 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:18.940
 they left neither the 2 and well just find 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.830
 a page where it left some links where 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.830
 I will share it with all of you 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.140
 so that you download it and play and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.970
 Well, here are the parts of the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.230
 game 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.930
 we go for example to a 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.090
 that this is complicated an audience of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.830
 download more complicated than others 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.830
 does not wait in less than five seconds 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.200
 let's jump advertising 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.780
 then this publicity here the 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.330
 we remove then we wait for us to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.460
 load the links and then here 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.890
 we will have as if there were several 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.490
 download processors that we give 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.909
 to one for example the puzzle or that is the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.549
 best 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.549
 we give you then here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.690
 here we do not load the website now 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.480

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.480
 good this download processor 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.320
 good 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.930
 the sector does not go before some do not go 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.870
 why go to one for example to this one 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.540
 then this continues to work and 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.910
 then you give to anybody 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.210
 that works if one does not work 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.080

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.850
 but there are 286 seconds that are and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.580
