00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.659
 to make it possible for a little video for you 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:12.139
 so here I am still going to cross-check the peak data 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.309
 for them it's a little dry but not necessarily indignant 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.829
 so after moult 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.369
 photo to see if they want to stay pissed 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 so yes I cut all my points 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.890
 you point 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.890
 after vitrification - adomos I was looking for 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.330
 % and I see that there is more trace of my mail and that it was the year 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.160
 last and wet 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.600
 about a year ago 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.520
 in December 2008 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.700
 so 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.870
 the oval% and I was very disappointed by the elder finally 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.680
 not by the care as such but especially the fact of not having 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 color so I was really expecting the EU and the colors but I want 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.410
 it was not the case but on the other hand 5 years worn missing I talk about piss 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 natural of course I do not speak unreineated recomposed 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.690
 the museum of tubize d2 times of a recomposed and that made me much 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 cherub ulrick 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.300
 that but he thought a lot and I think it was a note 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.700
 the reason I had forks 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180
 so that my computer 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 I made some photos that I will post euros on my blog 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 for them of the part in order to of the quantity that I cut 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.830
 I can so here I am still a few falls still a lot of hair 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.090
 too strong 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.140
 and in europe 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.970
 druelle the film but she cut it tip but unfortunately I have not 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.350
 thought on the stroke or horse 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.830
 I am one and two 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.130
 of purpose 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.210
 finally once more than 30 languages 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.270
 so 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.730
 marrow donation does it very well 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.090
 that's what I was doing to abandon high school arguges we cut off enough 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.979
 worse despite that the hyundai coupe points that way it's up to 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:57.770
 say 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.820
 I'm explaining to you a little bit about how things are going in different ways 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.680
 cut the tips 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 either you do and no longer have penniless and you cut 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.959
 abou diaby cisse failed forked boulogne 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.999
 so I did like that before 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
 but as I could not miss 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.589
 2 for now I do not know his hair 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.199
 so it turns out I found our method to fool the eight points 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.919
 Yes 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.469
 a big shot for blow 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.959
 so for those who are not familiar with the six-day war 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.689
 better than they can 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.480
 coupled to the point of how makes us happy did the 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.819
 mowing demonstration much more explained christelle it's going to be very 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.549
 hard to understand 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.949
 so I separated the storm was not as many parts as usual 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.700
 gilles duceppe according to a decree the teacher with% 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.409
 by the smoke and I lost my novel 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.929
 with an expense 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.639
 and he can 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.030
 he was repaired 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.529
 texan small horizontal section 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.379
 jewelry 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.339
 pj from lille 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.459
 sabine points a little damaged is not very damaged 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.279
 and I brought the private litigation 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.019
 so we can still if the chili 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.029
 that's good 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.929
 for my part I did not consider it as if he had been very clever but 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.929
 just spikes 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.139
 So here is 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.549
 so the hiv that I talked about the world and cook the mics compound 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.429
 who are very very bad 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.349
 for them 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.349
 especially for the mas brands 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.790
 rare khadir are not gifts 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.680
 natural 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.849
 must be super careful special challenge manufactured 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.309
 this idea was born in your hair 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.429
 any coloring sign this will 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:47.490
 2 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.769
 three ideas 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.239
 because 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.609
 lagarde 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.439
 the interaction between countries and recomposed illico the rest in chemistry 4 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.439
 - give full lungs 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.989
 explosive cocktail 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.519
 selflessness 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.659
 you're lucky it's not happening anything lie you're not summoned 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 if you have less luck 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.039
 your hair dignitaries 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.209
 no matter how many chemical staining you will put in your 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.120
 head 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 on your head earlier for that we will have his building 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.090
 and at weber will not leave returned since 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:30.849
 catastrophic interactions and initially proposed it cynical staining c 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 alpha blondy so i want your hair look 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.110
 next meeting the young man was understandable 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.009
 you have your tito ride in the bathtub so that 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.050
 pay close attention to seniors to help in your hair 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.409
 rather than on your hair deodic it happened a minute not blurred 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.930
 capsules can not sleep 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.669
 so I wanted to make a little video 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.729
 for europe but at the same time it will be a little bit of time for that 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.120
 that it must be made to live their passion so it turns out that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.770
 I cut my spikes 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.960
 I made several pictures to see if there was any way can cover 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.389
 moreover the winemakers composing 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.349
 so there is nothing 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.659
 I want to be colorful and this sign I do not know when but I will do everything 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.820
 so boilard 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.400
 so I hesitate between the brand bf laurent delamarre three chains that 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.639
 are supposedly 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.439
 fading the office 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.979
 better on the internet according to them the desire 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.520
 Florent Pagny taken good note 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.150
 I really like to think that this collaboration is not a 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.469
 natural color 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.659
 so I'm going to think I know I have a problem I have good hair 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.919
 sure with a color 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.259
 5- Ammonia because the single currency 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.230
 you see I'm happy 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.759
 it's just that this collaboration with nail polish 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.759
 to benefit from a hairdresser but problem afro hairstyles 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.399
 the stage farting afro natural hair so because you have to go to 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.520
 whites 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.229
 you have to go home after all why alpha afro hairstyle 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.589
 with all the consequences 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:11.830
 the club 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.639
 this may cause a little to your hair 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.389
 so here it was a simple video to tell you that 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.310
 so we need a tip already in account the fact that colin his wake 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.439
 some 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:27.089
 who have already tested dion discoloration in parentheses that are more 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.599
 strong three chains 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:33.330
 for another coloring of Washington office chemistry because he did not speak 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.029
 of narbonne logo 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.509
 we want chiraquisme 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.009
 I tested happiness 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.020
 it did not comment the hair it gave me glare 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.819
 but it did not color my hair 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:43.960
 and I tested 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.099
 several times 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.699
 three times to decline this marks chirac and papineau 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.069
 100% natural in all directions and metallic 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.759
 and unfortunately for them it's not going to color the hair either so 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.300
 L was 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.969
 enormously disappointed can not kill him 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.219
 as regards not 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:04.240
 the shade of pink color 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.599
 the perception of Basque colors 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.779
 I've been disappointed 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.099
 among them the lack of colors 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:14.269
 made with summer colorations so if some commercials 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.729
 coloring 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.309
 without ammonia not necessarily the turn of the Moroccan Aurillac trentin did 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:22.589
 comments but ultimately 

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:26.059
 we will share their experiences in other societies on these words 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.930
 I wish you a very good day in a row I did not write 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.539
 and then at the end of the world percent 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.029
 teliasonera is like me 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.489
 Well
