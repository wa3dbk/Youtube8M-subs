the gym hold on a minute and we'll get

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.470 
the gym hold on a minute and we'll get
there<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.890> gonna<00:00:19.980> try<00:00:20.250> thunderpunch<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480

there we're gonna try thunderpunch to
paralyze<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.740> sleep<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.300> very

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
paralyze it because sleep is very

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.400 
paralyze it because sleep is very
annoying<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.080> ineffective<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> we'll<00:00:28.199> just

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
annoying and ineffective so we'll just

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
annoying and ineffective so we'll just
keep<00:00:28.560> trying<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.480> ball<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.050> think

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
keep trying this and this ball I think

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
I've got 27 left very very nice charm I
don't<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.340> any<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.789> attacks<00:00:48.149> qualify<00:00:48.690> as

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
don't think any my attacks qualify as

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.680 
don't think any my attacks qualify as
physical<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.860> they're<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.370> matter<00:00:50.690> Thunder

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
physical so they're my matter Thunder

punch<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.469> miss<00:00:52.920> ball<00:00:53.160> again<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
punch and miss ball again I think it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
punch and miss ball again I think it
only<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:54.270> five<00:00:54.510> miss<00:00:54.719> balls<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.260> my<00:00:56.039> special

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
only has five miss balls so my special

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.040 
only has five miss balls so my special
attack<00:00:56.670> won't<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.059> damaged<00:00:57.360> too<00:00:57.539> much<00:00:57.690> oh

rocks<00:01:40.740> which<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.880> totally<00:01:42.210> unnecessary

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
rocks which is totally unnecessary

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
rocks which is totally unnecessary
because<00:01:42.930> Oh<00:01:43.700> repel<00:01:44.700> okay<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> used

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
because Oh repel okay then we you used

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.270 
because Oh repel okay then we you used
to<00:01:47.310> repel<00:01:47.549> again<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.360> says<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:50.100> way

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to repel again and this says a that way

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
to repel again and this says a that way
I<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.360> means<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.810> it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I don't know what that means but it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.249 
I don't know what that means but it's
that<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.770> whatever<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.960> if<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.079> may

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that way whatever it is and if you may

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.840 
that way whatever it is and if you may
notice<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.799> totally<00:01:56.130> pointless<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.729> have

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
notice it's totally pointless to have

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
notice it's totally pointless to have
all<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:57.630> rocks<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> can't

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
all those rocks because if you can't

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.109 
all those rocks because if you can't
break<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> first<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.820> are<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> gonna

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
break the first one how are you gonna

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.370 
break the first one how are you gonna
break<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> second<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.020> even<00:02:01.140> have

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
break the second one and even have

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.700 
break the second one and even have
gotten<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.840> continue<00:02:04.229> down<00:02:04.259> through

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
gotten to it so we continue down through

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
gotten to it so we continue down through
the<00:02:04.829> cave<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.610> busted<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.329> rocks

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the cave and we busted some more rocks

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.380 
the cave and we busted some more rocks
and<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> haven't<00:02:08.160> noticed<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.849> would

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and if you haven't noticed there would

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
and if you haven't noticed there would
be<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.599> lot<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.869> trainers<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.069> can
