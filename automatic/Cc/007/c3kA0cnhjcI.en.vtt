00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.299
 rosalie everything at home mr geek 18 and 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.220
 today have especially on one another 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.320
 another video on a tutorial 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.840
 so today I 'm going to make a 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.310
 tutorial on spawner words because I 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.650
 noticed that there was not a lot of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.690
 videos on words this happiness and this 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.529
 video that exists on our happiness was 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.110
 in English so bgg fucked I wanted 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.510
 make a video especially tomatoes happiness 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.660
 with my acquaintances hoping 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.470
 that it is fir trees so I'm going 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.270
 do several tutorial parts for them 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.980
 four main domain monsters 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.090
 thanks what leaves colette the zombies 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 lets that zombie clippers and 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.829
 spiders so today I'm going to you 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.870
 present the tutorials the tutorial vamos 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.030
 taker reigns so beyond I simulated 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.640
 a bit like a common how 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.089
 is called as a mule gold here is this 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.729
 we will do 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.310
 it's just not super hard 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.619
 but the problem with them arenas 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.170
 here they are pretty hard claimed 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.090
 since they are small passes 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 in a cube but on two of wide so 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.720
 they tend to go everywhere 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.150
 so I found a little technique 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 them all alone and play to you do it 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.600
 share 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.189
 so I explain the system we are going 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.610
 already removed disable the word spawner to 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:39.360
 of energy and at these games put them a 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.360
 content well yeah 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.330
 so here we are going to say that you come from 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.630
 close your spawner word telling you no or 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.700
 who is coming down to us with a good and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.430
 hardly an ip what for the teams way 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.080
 abrupt aristocrat friend 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.330
 so there the last thanks to the bar does 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.800
 can not pass and given that bahia 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.080
 for a half more tube so she 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.620
 not go there can not pass in the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.260
 two blocks 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.990
 since jaka there is 15 wide 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.390
 is there you could more than train them 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.940
 to the dishes and pick up all the countries that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.480
 falls it's pretty simple in me I have a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.090
 sword conveyed to those away the same 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920
 study that will be totally nothing 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.410
 to kill them more easily hop there 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.290
 then there you can get massaged fast 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.660
 the lambs and easily sense forward 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.220
 two problems 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.090
 we will pick up the xp and we will 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.070
 show how these people have so we 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.070
 mounts we will disable the word spawner 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:50.689
 and we will put the day here so here 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.390
 I red hero simulate a hamlet spawner 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.750
 finally a dungeon excuse me I'm not 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.519
 not bothered though to do business 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.620
 there the mine as you see the 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.980
 simulation dominates I'm not too 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.159
 so annoying when you come on 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.480
 you have by that when you have here my 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.799
 case I know you as wanted to break 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.000
 and we're going to make a hole here 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.359
 what size do you want you 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.319
 really do the size does not matter 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.970
 we make the size you want 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.459
 so that we will try to make his 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.790
 clean and well show you in me there 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.250
 there is stop on the side that blocks you 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.500
 it avoids doing anything so you 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.939
 make a hole like you want me 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.340
 I think I make 1 2 that you 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:41.450
 see it does not find with the purchase 1 2 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.480
 yeah I'm going to take a step will find 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.389
 from 5 3 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.760
 not even need 400 that's enough 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:54.220
 amply 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:00.949
 hop the castro we will leave on his life 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:05.209
 so here it is now that you have 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:10.190
 dug here the goal is to count here 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:13.299
 counted 6 7 8 6 did eight killed the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.720
 case also be called 8 1 2 3 4 5 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:21.530
 so here we're going to add one more so 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.370
 there we have 6 7 8 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.599
 so why 8b it's very simple 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:35.720
 will put water sources and 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:41.330
 water sources I will show 3 1 2 3 4 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.789
 5 6 7 8 and 9 showed the jumps are 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.250
 limited to eight blocks so that's fine 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.110
 help take zain far for 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.779
 typing and laughing picking up praise him is tp is 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.620
 embarrassed by the flow of water that's why 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.440
 we will do 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.860
 8 of 8 2 lengths so here I am at 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.419
 eight 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.750
 we will put everything on all along 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:05.340
 to do a sweep 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:09.479
 here it says that there is who has your 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.040
 only what of your mine then in the 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.850
 soil of your mine where he was going to make a 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.330
 hole for b to access the rate of 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.400
 worries to be able to kill lisa wins so 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.600
 we are going to do great volume we will not 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.650
 a trunk says you went down 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.650
 like that the tac tac tac tac 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.180
 Here it is then the hole friends wanted 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.340
 release well for not being too close to 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.680
 the grid because despite the gli they can 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.880
 still attack you I think so 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.250
 you too to move away to have 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.580
 a small margin to go back 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.350
 you can do 2-2 here to avoid 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.630
 put a chest anything for 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.490
 store your tastes and your drops 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.199
 here now family here you can 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.000
 the rouen until going up on 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.810
 square show a scale for 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.810
 get off easily 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.370
 yeah we are a little site on his own 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.820
 way there you get off with your 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.120
 scale you have here then not even this 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.570
 that this is where you are here 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.020
 take barriers very simple hop there 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.720
 you put your barriers all the way 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.310
 and you put all two blocks 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.820
 finally all the blocks really people a 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.910
 block a block here barriers for not 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.070
 it goes on and that's your your your 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.410
 what's your spider's name 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.440
 and then there I broke his point on 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.729
 can leave it there is the margin 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.849
 so we'll try to install it 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.289
 wii and little advice if the mine because 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.639
 that the mine had continued towards the pair 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.449
 but there for Easter a clip do not come 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.210
 more to the mouth 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:49.440
 moscow nerves and I also advise you 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:52.800
 of such facts Rome make a dish 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.900
 this in your mine left to let 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.510
 holes like that if you need 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.719
 to disable your spawner word you 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:04.650
 just have to get here and break 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:07.160
 the momentum not a dish have blown up 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.229
 but I broke directly Moscow 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.620
 I am like that happens to you and says if 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:16.800
 you have more than to jump or you 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.690
 disable all your spawner word and 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.220
 it's good it's over 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.440
 so we'll put the night for it 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:28.350
 walk hop there ah yes to years that 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.240
 sometimes spawn spawn on the word 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.639
 spawner so you have if they wanted 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.360
 type before December where you go 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.550
 simply above 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.800
 so here is the year we have more than the 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.520
 kill and pick up the struggles 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.400
 so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.990
 this tutorial on emotion does not have to win 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.780
 I soon make a word spawner on 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.310
 the skeletons am not played and that's it 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.990
 so thanks for watching this video 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.150
 I also thank you for being so
