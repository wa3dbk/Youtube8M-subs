hello<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.650> my<00:00:01.920> review<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:03.149> family

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hello this is my review of the family

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.460 
hello this is my review of the family
home<00:00:03.720> set<00:00:04.140> number<00:00:04.650> 6<00:00:04.770> 75<00:00:05.520> for<00:00:06.029> now<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
home set number 6 75 for now this is a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.020 
home set number 6 75 for now this is a
three-in-one<00:00:07.980> said<00:00:08.400> there<00:00:08.730> are<00:00:08.849> other

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
three-in-one said there are other

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.669 
three-in-one said there are other
options<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.809> just<00:00:09.990> chose<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.380> make<00:00:10.530> this

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
options but I just chose to make this

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.410 
options but I just chose to make this
one<00:00:11.360> now<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.750> outside<00:00:13.429> features<00:00:14.429> there

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
one now on the outside features there

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.990 
one now on the outside features there
are<00:00:15.750> shutters<00:00:16.500> which<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.310> think<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> pretty<00:00:17.760> cool

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
are shutters which I think a pretty cool

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.870 
are shutters which I think a pretty cool
they<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:18.960> clothes<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.380> stuff<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
they all kind clothes and stuff and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.570 
they all kind clothes and stuff and
there's<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.970> little<00:00:21.300> grid<00:00:21.960> path<00:00:22.550> although<00:00:23.550> I

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
there's a little grid path although I

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.640 
there's a little grid path although I
think<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> annoying<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.410> make

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
think this is kind of annoying to make

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.779 
think this is kind of annoying to make
because<00:00:26.070> they're<00:00:27.410> all<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.429> by<00:00:29.550> one

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
because they're all little one by one

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.290 
because they're all little one by one
pieces<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.230> takes<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.619> while<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
pieces and it takes a while to make that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.170 
pieces and it takes a while to make that
whole<00:00:33.540> thing<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.520> actually<00:00:35.670> made<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
whole thing and I actually made it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170 
whole thing and I actually made it
smaller<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.899> i<00:00:37.590> could<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.640> build<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> rest

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
smaller so i could get to build the rest

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
smaller so i could get to build the rest
of<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.800> there's<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.129> bird<00:00:41.309> bath

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
of it and there's a little bird bath

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.709 
of it and there's a little bird bath
here<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.559> am<00:00:43.559> pond<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.329> cool

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
here and am pond it which is pretty cool

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.160 
here and am pond it which is pretty cool
and<00:00:45.960> they<00:00:46.680> had<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.610> pieces<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and they had little pieces here for a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.750 
and they had little pieces here for a
duck<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.430> turned<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> duck<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.320> bird

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
duck but I turned the duck into a bird

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
duck but I turned the duck into a bird
so<00:00:53.760> yeah<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.190> side

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so yeah and then over on this side

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.150 
so yeah and then over on this side
there's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> little<00:00:57.570> patio<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.649> i<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
there's a little patio which i think is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.610 
there's a little patio which i think is
pretty<00:00:59.430> cool<00:00:59.489> you're<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> bunch<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.620> smooth

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
pretty cool you're a bunch of smooth

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.380 
pretty cool you're a bunch of smooth
faces<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> am

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
faces like that and then there is am

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.880 
faces like that and then there is am
bench<00:01:07.340> table<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.110> I'm<00:01:10.110> pretty<00:01:10.439> sure<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bench table and I'm pretty sure this is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
bench table and I'm pretty sure this is
a<00:01:11.040> light<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.119> exactly<00:01:12.689> sure<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
a light but I'm not exactly sure what it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.700 
a light but I'm not exactly sure what it
is<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.810> flowers<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.290> right

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
glass door it slides and then there's an

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.550 
glass door it slides and then there's an
awning<00:01:26.070> above<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.630> actually

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
awning above it which it's actually

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 
awning above it which it's actually
built<00:01:28.860> into<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> wall<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.909> their<00:01:30.810> little

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
built into the wall and their little

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
built into the wall and their little
support<00:01:31.530> things<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.340> also<00:01:32.520> built<00:01:33.270> into

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
support things that are also built into

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.039 
support things that are also built into
the<00:01:33.630> wall<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.400> then<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.579> shutters<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.299> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the wall and then the shutters on this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.090 
the wall and then the shutters on this
side<00:01:37.290> also<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.439> made<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> new

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
side also and I like they made a new

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.569 
side also and I like they made a new
Lego<00:01:42.000> element<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:43.009> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.070> hard<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> see

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
Lego element is kind of hard to see

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.810 
Lego element is kind of hard to see
right<00:01:44.990> here<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.040> corner<00:01:47.100> that's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
right here right in this corner that's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
right here right in this corner that's
all<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.270> piece<00:01:48.680> right<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.310> think

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
all one piece right there and I think

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
all one piece right there and I think
that's<00:01:50.700> pretty<00:01:50.850> cool<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.770> made<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that's pretty cool but they made that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
that's pretty cool but they made that
I'm<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.579> sure<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.119> already<00:01:54.299> had<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
I'm not sure if I already had that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.280 
I'm not sure if I already had that
before<00:01:54.810> did<00:01:55.680> my<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.390> then<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> side<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
before did my and then on the side the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.219 
before did my and then on the side the
chimney<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.850> different<00:02:00.119> colors<00:02:00.600> with

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
chimney it's all different colors with

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.080 
chimney it's all different colors with
these<00:02:01.740> grid<00:02:02.509> these<00:02:03.509> texture<00:02:04.380> pieces<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.090> think

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
these grid these texture pieces I think

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.630 
these grid these texture pieces I think
that's<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.390> cool<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.649> there's<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
that's pretty cool and then there's the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.540 
that's pretty cool and then there's the
back<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.119> stuff

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
back and stuff

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.350 
back and stuff
and<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.870> like<00:02:11.380> how<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.500> gutters<00:02:14.500> here

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and I like how they have gutters here

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.920 
and I like how they have gutters here
there's<00:02:16.360> also<00:02:16.570> gutters<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.100> back<00:02:18.930> right

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
there's also gutters on the back right

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.360 
there's also gutters on the back right
here<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:22.270> that's<00:02:22.630> pretty<00:02:22.810> cool<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.380> then

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
here so that's pretty cool and then

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
there's a window on the side where half

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.499 
there's a window on the side where half
of<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:31.620> on<00:04:31.889> this<00:04:32.100> half<00:04:32.370> on<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:33.000> roof<00:04:33.210> and

I'm working on stuff for the bottom
player<00:05:10.199> and<00:05:10.440> it's<00:05:11.430> not<00:05:11.759> exactly<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.630> scale

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
player and it's not exactly to scale

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.900 
player and it's not exactly to scale
with<00:05:13.169> minifigures<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:14.009> mean<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.310> still<00:05:14.610> works

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
with minifigures I mean it still works

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.140 
with minifigures I mean it still works
like<00:05:15.389> it's<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.750> same<00:05:15.960> size<00:05:16.289> door<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.800> stuff

like it's the same size door and stuff

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.120 
like it's the same size door and stuff
but<00:05:18.150> it's<00:05:18.449> not<00:05:19.160> exactly<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.580> scale<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.960> that<00:05:22.320> is

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
but it's not exactly to scale so that is

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.510
