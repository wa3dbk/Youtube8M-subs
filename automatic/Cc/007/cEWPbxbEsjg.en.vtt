00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.670
 and the thorax 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.290
 what we expect with the mania alleged the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 size and the power of your computer the pace 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:43.840
 that they put was very difficult to face 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:47.810
 then the score was an authentic 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.550
 reflection of the 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.070
 the qualities of the two teams in my 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.070
 opinion on the touches we have tried 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.560
 produced variations and so on we are 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.710
 very bad in exceptions says that in 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.470
 centers that we lost everything and then 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 we mark an essay or we mark points and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.640
 then we moved dry receptions by 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.640
 example at my disposal 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.250
 i 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.609
 and the good solution to do more 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.179
 variations in trout and what you have to 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:34.649
 be very creative because Jorge is and had 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.649
 the same profile as from Romania 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
 m 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.750
 when a team must defend to stop 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.269
 most of the party that there is every 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.230
 ball that you have you should take advantage of 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:48.730
 then at the moment there is not the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.650
 margin of error is very little to improve 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.870
 the line I believe that our three 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.569
 rooms are 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.569
 prepared to have more position 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.049
 good 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.600
 if in the end against these people you have to 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.390
 put a lot of people are also double 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.700
 that we and in the end we need a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.210
 even if it's a pair of players to 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.670
 defend one of them did not make us 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.250
 a couple of us did a couple of phases with 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.270
 the forward and would have at the end we have 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.270
 broken the party so not 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.039
 well we still have to work and 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.949
 we still have to go to georgia and then 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:41.870
 portugal also I think we have to 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.870
 make good paper and keep improving
