00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 Hello 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.560
 the thing 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.720
 the July data on them the contract in 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.200
 territory changed then embarrassment 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.200
 how to do it 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.250
 dear with song 27 of ulisse 's stand 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.760
 recur 30 instead of another 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:01:02.720
 important anniversary not rescue 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:10.540
 all because you will be like below 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.540
 I say I was very friend 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 I interviewed him 56 time on the region yes 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 they had to get out of the institutions that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 they had the other thing for sale 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.979
 I want to remember he knows that in 70 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:35.790
 stories I have almost nothing to see 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.850
 what to see he said there is a 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.780
 moment in which the company is the dictatorship 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.750
 I'd like everyone to cortassa 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.460
 so much so that yesterday with god I told him 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.100
 Machiavelli says the end justifies the means 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.259
 he told me it's not true he did not 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 he never said and sent the documentation 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:05.490
 because it looks like but then I think when 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.130
 he will leave because we said that 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.100
 when he turns ninety even armed 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.470
 grandfather because before the man they are adept at 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.380
 but to the woman who could not be told in the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.329
 sindh did not decide the fa must go 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.329
 to the presidency routes 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.670
 look at the 40 button and the 40.8 and 11 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.670
 millions 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.460
 president as president candidate 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.460
 silvio 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:58.110
 there is no 34 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.110
 so good 34 35 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:13.900
 and you don't vote if you are president 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.900
 of the council to play by 70 percent 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.160
 the chancellery is the extra town 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:34.790
 against a sailed regatta 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:42.700
 certainly also a ship the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:46.700
 social prince and the secret father 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.290
 then I am in favor of 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.550
 Chancellery stories are entered 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:01.970
 tontini against containing continuous the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:03.830
 market word inter raised I am 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.720
 following this thing in the city of 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.740
 let's say science is still not known 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.290
 if he is recovering 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:15.830
 It is something that you say after a 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.070
 pain period pain than at least 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.110
 obviously smart is one thing 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.980
 it really is something that happens in politics 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.810
 there is a striking life policy that does not 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.760
 you can tell from what comes out 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.650
 tonight inter hot 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:38.730
 then he sees that it is Latin then the ulisse 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.850
 Homeric see the readers of the odyssey here 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.310
 great challenges were experienced on the Iliad 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.310
 they were big though they didn't have big 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.440
 doubts that they were interested in how but 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.200
 not why it is the entrance to 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.210
 Christianity that makes this come out 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.120
 he asks why because everything was already 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.990
 written by the fact and therefore not by 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.420
 is not interested in any way 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.980
 in the end we say physics of the body of 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.110
 Ulysses is not interested in shipwreck 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.620
 he is interested in the shipwreck 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.350
 of the soul that is present we possess 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.420
 intimately that of greatness 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.420
 of art but it does not feel small 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.040
 soon I will say a name not in this 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.020
 type but we learn everything is not that they are 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.270
 some illusions and all the illusion 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.730
 of all illusions I do not give up 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.320
 wonderful that of our soul 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:40.620
 this is the thing one 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.620
 ministoria emilio amor ruggiero 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.949
 and then I was saying here he is 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.479
 well done to interrupt my doing 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.930
 this is because that is very important 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.610
 What did you say 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.969
 here you go right into the air 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.680
 wait a while I was saying here 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:06:00.629
 what do you hear me or not I said he has me 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.780
 and asked him a monument and then it is 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:06.270
 overturned ulisse mood at the end i 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:14.310
 not thought of at Palazzo Chigi 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:17.310
 you must make the rector taught these 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.889
 in elementary school and we kind of sinners 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.990
 that we do not know now medieval 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.719
 not even what the politicians are talking about 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.460
 who operate with fraud as a thing a 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.990
 us strangers to singing before 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.330
 there are even other thieves 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.710
 what better politicians who stole 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.259
 think what happened in the Middle Ages 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.389
 recent policy making investment 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.509
 other money or at least less than that 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:44.039
 then meditate stuff then I said 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:48.060
 so I was doing ulisse in the circle of 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:50.789
 of fraudulent advisors 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.339
 then what is the sin of ulisse tu 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:56.879
 you have a vision I saw romantic that is 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:59.069
 what we say has had strength 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:01.349
 for so long that it goes from allison to 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.599
 first raise up to first levi to one 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:06.029
 romantic interpretation of the undue payment 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:09.120
 the dante the dante 's ulisse 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:12.000
 I repeat to you now I will try to read it 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.560
 but then again it is something is really there who 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.110
 considers it the highest page in the world 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.539
 to himself to blow it if you do it 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.930
 we ask this is the dante's ulisse 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.689
 alighieri 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:25.319
 what does ulisse ulisse do? 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:29.370
 ubris prevarication excess arrogance 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:33.240
 challenge to infinity has the desire to 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.129
 possess the infinite that is not possible 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.650
 the sailors who incite with that fraction 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:43.099
 little place considered for your seed 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.099
 and the last lie unevenness
