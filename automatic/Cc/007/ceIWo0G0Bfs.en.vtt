00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.830
 hey hey and welcome to one 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.170
 new video of me 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
 this time it's about the flat ones 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.720
 flash tattoos that's it 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.490
 summer trend 2015 and I was recently 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 on the flea market and there I have these 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.619
 Tattoos seen and thought that can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.269
 Give it a try and we will not 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 I can now recognize with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 flash chips a bit around 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.239
 experiments and that's what's there 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 came out like the whole 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.890
 works on what you should look out for 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.180
 and what i think about flash batteries 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.180
 you will learn everything in this video 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.660
 i would say flash me again as 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.170
 It would be the first time and I wish 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 you have a lot of fun 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.700
 yes these are my flash tattoos i have 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 me here for colors in silver black 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.330
 gold and turquoise decided 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.939
 I think this is a hammer together 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.619
 moderate combination and you need 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.030
 Of course, there is a bit of a scrape around it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.220
 to snow whole in shape 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 or the respective parts 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.490
 to cut apart and then 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.560
 you also need something 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.210
 with which you could absorb water for 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 example, such a rag or a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.710
 swam and the very first thing you do 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.720
 one takes his scissors and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.380
 first cuts all parts out of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380
 you want to have 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.510
 I have chosen mine 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 spice hand a little under 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.420
 These stripes are actually suitable 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.800
 quite good for that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 and that's why I have it 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.000
 mostly strips cut out and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.030
 can then use it as a ring if you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.680
 it cuts short or as a bracelet or man 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.910
 you can also completely for a finger 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.650
 use and around my side no matter how the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.150
 I have to make a bit more peppy 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.650
 me then also here these little ones 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.090
 Cut out diamonds at 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.670
 you should cut it out 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.220
 that you are not too close to toto along 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.990
 cuts because there is such a kind 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.790
 glue layer on tattoo the course 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.940
 should remain undamaged so that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.800
 whole best is liable to the whole 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.870
 Now it's time to get carried away 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.660
 piece chain and pulls this first 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.270
 Protective film and then the whole thing with 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.270
 the sticky side glued on the skin 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.490
 when our offender to a bit 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
 Firmly pressed then when you look 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.200
 his wet rag or sponge and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.730
 moistened the tempo first so 20 to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.710
 30 seconds long, the tattoo must 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
 to be properly moistened so 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.660
 do not waste too much with the water 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.220
 and after that 20 to 30 seconds see 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.860
 you then already that the film already 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.130
 almost by itself solves and the tattoo 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.170
 then stick to your skin and if you 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.790
 such a few bumps in your tito 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.010
 you can just cope 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.030
 pluck and then the whole then first 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.820
 let dry 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.050
 to you this little crisis like me 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.300
 had to spare 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.460
 I just point it out that 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.560
 you should take care that yours 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.610
 flash tattoo it beforehand by no means 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.800
 get wet 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.850
 because once they are wet catch 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.770
 to stick it on 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.320
 and then you can not get her anymore 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.280
 Remove this protective film without using it 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.650
 to destroy 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.110
 So best not like me next to 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.030
 keep my hand but somewhere 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.459
 where they can not get wet after and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.380
 after will share from these individual 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.450
 a complete picture and i would say 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.570
 We'll just take a look at the result 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.570
 on 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.380
 I would say that's cool 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.260
 Trend or I like this interaction 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.360
 be funky out of modernity though 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.530
 somehow simultaneously elegant and 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.270
 his oriental 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.970
 I think that's very nice together 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.950
 However, this mix is â€‹â€‹so that 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.900
 flash tattoo does not last that long 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.790
 that's good somewhere because you want it 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.109
 yes only temporarily have on the 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.840
 But the other side is like that too 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.390
 These flash tattoos are too fast again 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.130
 if you are like for example 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.380
 I put his tattoos on his hand 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.880
 then it can happen that spreads 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.400
 this tattoo it very very fast 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.770
 cracked and ugly will have that easy 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.530
 to do with that our hands resp 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.330
 fingers are constantly in motion 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.760
 accordingly this tattoo is also 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.680
 always in motion what finally 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.720
 ensures that it enters faster 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.940
 and just looks stupid 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.250
 therefore one should place oneself body 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.070
 not cry now extremely under 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.440
 movement or voltage stand with it 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 whole just keeps longer in spite of everything 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.040
 is there a fat thumbs up 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.260
 for flash tattoos because I find them 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.640
 are a very nice trend and that 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.470
 accessory for this summer so ladies 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.970
 Get ready to flash and me 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.650
 would say it was from my side 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.060
 Many thanks for watching and 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.600
 I'll see you next time 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.600
 take care
