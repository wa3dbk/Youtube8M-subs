00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
having a battle with him and a bunch of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
having a battle with him and a bunch of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
crap happened and he doesn't understand

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.750 
crap happened and he doesn't understand
the<00:00:42.840> definition<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.739> critical<00:00:44.010> hit<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the definition of a critical hit a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
the definition of a critical hit a
critical<00:00:45.660> hit<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.050> more<00:00:46.320> likely<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> happen

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
critical hit is more likely to happen

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
critical hit is more likely to happen
when<00:00:47.160> somebody<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.730> SAT<00:00:48.030> raises<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.600> their

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
when somebody has SAT raises for their

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
when somebody has SAT raises for their
defenses<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.860> critical<00:00:50.190> hit<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.520> bypass

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
defenses and a critical hit will bypass

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.750 
defenses and a critical hit will bypass
all<00:00:51.180> stat<00:00:52.110> raises<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.370> double

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
all stat raises and then do double

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.689 
all stat raises and then do double
damage<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.469> saying<00:00:55.770> oh<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
damage but he was saying oh but it's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
damage but he was saying oh but it's
never<00:00:56.940> did<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> third<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> my<00:00:58.079> walls

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
never did one of the third to my walls

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.729 
never did one of the third to my walls
well<00:00:59.219> yeah<00:00:59.489> guess<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:00.320> critical<00:01:01.320> hits<00:01:01.530> do

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
well yeah guess what critical hits do

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.670 
well yeah guess what critical hits do
more<00:01:02.010> than<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.340> they<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.660> ton<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> damage

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
more than that they do a ton of damage

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.910 
more than that they do a ton of damage
when<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.339> plus<00:01:05.700> 6<00:01:06.119> defense<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> yeah

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
when you're at plus 6 defense so yeah

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039 
when you're at plus 6 defense so yeah
here's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> battle<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.420> star<00:01:09.720> wars

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
there's always bend so I go for charge

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.270 
there's always bend so I go for charge
beam<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.660> does<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:28.080> decent<00:02:28.560> chunk<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
beam and it does a decent chunk to the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.920 
beam and it does a decent chunk to the
stupid<00:02:29.730> sizzle<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.300> get<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.510> special
