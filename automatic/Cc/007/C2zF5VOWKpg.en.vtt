four aspects of the vidi-vidi drive will

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.480 
four aspects of the vidi-vidi drive will
test<00:00:22.860> out<00:00:24.050> insert<00:00:25.050> feed<00:00:25.350> mechanism<00:00:25.590> will<00:00:26.220> test

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
test out insert feed mechanism will test

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.069 
test out insert feed mechanism will test
out<00:00:27.710> we<00:00:29.420> magnetic<00:00:30.420> spindle<00:00:30.780> more<00:00:31.640> laser

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
out we magnetic spindle more laser

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.229 
out we magnetic spindle more laser
movement<00:00:34.079> assembly<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.769> actual<00:00:35.370> laser<00:00:35.850> or

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
movement assembly and actual laser or

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.279 
movement assembly and actual laser or
lens<00:00:36.539> module<00:00:37.190> okay<00:00:38.420> let's<00:00:39.420> test<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.839> these

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
lens module okay let's test all these

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.759 
lens module okay let's test all these
four<00:00:40.980> aspects<00:00:41.429> one<00:00:42.179> by<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.539> very<00:00:43.230> first<00:00:43.530> thing

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
four aspects one by one very first thing

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.319 
four aspects one by one very first thing
let's<00:00:44.219> insert<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> disk

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
let's insert a disk

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
let's insert a disk
let's<00:00:45.570> try<00:00:45.780> inside<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.199> desk<00:00:46.499> and<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.859> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
let's try inside a desk and see if it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.200 
let's try inside a desk and see if it
accepts<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:48.920> okay<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.370> accepting<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.999> disk

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
accepts it okay it's accepting the disk

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
accepts it okay it's accepting the disk
that<00:00:51.359> means<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.199> insert<00:00:52.469> feed<00:00:52.769> mechanism<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that means the insert feed mechanism is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
that means the insert feed mechanism is
fine<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> second<00:00:55.109> step<00:00:55.319> is<00:00:56.179> to<00:00:57.179> see<00:00:57.359> if<00:00:57.390> when

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
fine the second step is to see if when

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.889 
fine the second step is to see if when
the<00:00:58.469> disc<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.829> inserted<00:00:59.179> it<00:01:00.179> actually<00:01:00.569> spins

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the disc is inserted it actually spins

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.969 
the disc is inserted it actually spins
if<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:01.920> disk<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> spinning<00:01:02.339> then<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.329> means

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
if the disk is spinning then that means

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
if the disk is spinning then that means
the<00:01:04.979> magnetic<00:01:05.280> motor<00:01:05.700> assembly<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.360> fine<00:01:06.600> as

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the magnetic motor assembly is fine as

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
the magnetic motor assembly is fine as
well<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.140> easier<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.649> find<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.579> you<00:01:08.880> can

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
well the easier way to find is you can

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.249 
well the easier way to find is you can
hear<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> disk<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.920> spinning

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
hear it actually if the disk is spinning

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.719 
hear it actually if the disk is spinning
and<00:01:13.340> when<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> insert<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> disk<00:01:15.149> it<00:01:15.450> beeps<00:01:16.729> for

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and when the insert a disk it beeps for

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
and when the insert a disk it beeps for
a<00:01:17.759> brief<00:01:18.060> period<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.450> time<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a brief period of time so you know that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.980 
a brief period of time so you know that
actually<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.539> trying<00:01:21.810> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually that it's actually trying to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100 
actually that it's actually trying to
read<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.890> disk<00:01:23.180> okay<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.869> things

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
read the disk okay so these two things

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.370 
read the disk okay so these two things
are<00:01:25.259> fine<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.950> third<00:01:26.189> thing<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:27.110> let's<00:01:28.110> click

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
are fine the third thing is let's click

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.700 
are fine the third thing is let's click
on<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> let's<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.430> happens

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
on here and let's see what happens

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
on here and let's see what happens
that's<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.920> message<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.640> unable<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that's the message you get unable to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690 
that's the message you get unable to
read<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> disk<00:01:33.990> check<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.070> reiterations

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
read the disk check the reiterations

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.510 
read the disk check the reiterations
manual<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.329> crocheting<00:01:37.340> there<00:01:38.340> could<00:01:38.490> be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
manual for how crocheting there could be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.389 
manual for how crocheting there could be
two<00:01:38.729> issues<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.439> where<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> laser<00:01:40.799> movement

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
two issues now where the laser movement

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.480 
two issues now where the laser movement
assembly<00:01:41.789> or<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> lens<00:01:42.509> has<00:01:42.750> failed<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:44.189> order

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

to really lock with the follow mirror it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.980 
to really lock with the follow mirror it
is<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.649> need<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> open<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.340> V<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> check

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
is you need to open up your V and check

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.069 
is you need to open up your V and check
to<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.039> disc<00:01:50.219> is<00:01:50.429> inserted<00:01:51.079> the
