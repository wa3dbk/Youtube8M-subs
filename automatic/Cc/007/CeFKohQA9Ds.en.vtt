00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.510
 outside packages that have the advantage 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.709
 to be you choice they attack 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.390
 now but we also have them 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.800
 try to progress outside in 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.420
 do what cost benefits in the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.680

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.370
 you are a liar but carried away 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.140
 second position makes a little va 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.880
 to win here second place for but 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.590
 beyond third jo I took my 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.680
 fourth for violence 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.530
 the champions that have answered this from 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.030
 today of escatha price times since 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.470

 win for his first appearance 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.800
 in France 1 0 72 to May 2 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.840
 third place for I'm screaming 4 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.640
 2 and 3 is the arrival figures and it's 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.980
 as well as where for the title of this 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.100
 gold tea with the casaque of course alone 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.800
 racing that wins 7 for this prize 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.930
 this price of qatar which once very beautiful 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.250
 successful perfume that a course in 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.250
 but if I dare say we take pictures 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.990
 I do not want I have finally settled 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.360
 liked meanders but in which he 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:15.150
 deals with Switzerland is haggard and its 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.590
 abilities that bounces the horse to 150 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.720
 comfort of his means 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.250
 The announced this break to think 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.530
 whether it is 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.290
 but in 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.620
 validated tickets 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.620
 and 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 we must make do 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.810
 for sailing on the last master the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.889
 course was not what is your 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.139
 feeling 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.830
 no but for me it's hard on it 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.380
 it's because we have not been a 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.850
 really fast we wanted to show 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.560
 the field doing a good job with the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.120
 horse a beautiful race 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.620
 no, what with kino could go 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.770
 the faster we went a little by bump 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.930
 but I think they had to judge the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.390
 capabilities of their leaders and to say 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.300
 anthony crastus listens in his steps too 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.370
 leaving goldsmiths is an easy horse 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.050
 to mount so do not break the head for 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.580
 the departure but what would be interesting 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.080
 is that you can keep reserves 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.080
 to start the race
