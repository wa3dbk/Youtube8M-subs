00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:08.080 

okay<00:00:06.649> in<00:00:06.799> this<00:00:06.919> part<00:00:07.220> of<00:00:07.310> the<00:00:07.370> film<00:00:07.609> let<00:00:07.970> me

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
okay in this part of the film let me

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.299 
okay in this part of the film let me
show<00:00:08.300> you<00:00:08.390> how<00:00:08.510> we<00:00:08.570> build<00:00:08.900> up<00:00:09.020> this<00:00:09.200> figure<00:00:09.590> as

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
show you how we build up this figure as

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.740 
show you how we build up this figure as
you<00:00:10.490> can<00:00:10.639> see<00:00:10.790> here<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:11.150> figure<00:00:11.420> was<00:00:11.540> built

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
you can see here the figure was built

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.799 
you can see here the figure was built
before<00:00:12.049> the<00:00:12.110> painting<00:00:12.559> was<00:00:12.679> done<00:00:13.780> we<00:00:14.780> take

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
before the painting was done we take

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.890 
before the painting was done we take
strips<00:00:15.349> of<00:00:15.559> mounting<00:00:16.160> card<00:00:16.430> or<00:00:16.670> card<00:00:17.360> mat<00:00:17.689> as

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
strips of mounting card or card mat as

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.900 
strips of mounting card or card mat as
they<00:00:18.050> say<00:00:18.199> in<00:00:18.260> America<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:19.010> I<00:00:19.340> bent<00:00:19.609> them<00:00:19.760> in

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
they say in America and I bent them in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.720 
they say in America and I bent them in
loops<00:00:20.180> with<00:00:21.140> strips<00:00:21.470> of<00:00:21.619> card<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.160> then<00:00:22.640> I

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
loops with strips of card and then I

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.250 
loops with strips of card and then I
glue<00:00:23.029> those<00:00:23.240> onto<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.570> surface

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
glue those onto the surface

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.140 
glue those onto the surface
either<00:00:24.769> using<00:00:25.099> PVA<00:00:25.460> glue<00:00:25.550> or<00:00:26.029> silicone<00:00:26.570> sealer

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
either using PVA glue or silicone sealer

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.910 
either using PVA glue or silicone sealer
the<00:00:29.150> advantage<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.260> that<00:00:30.410> we<00:00:30.529> canvass

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
the advantage of this is that we canvass

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.560 
the advantage of this is that we canvass
remains<00:00:31.250> very<00:00:31.429> light<00:00:31.759> we<00:00:32.029> don't<00:00:32.060> have<00:00:32.360> huge

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
remains very light we don't have huge

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.590 
remains very light we don't have huge
areas<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.140> thick<00:00:33.500> plaster<00:00:34.130> or<00:00:34.610> filler<00:00:35.000> to

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
areas of thick plaster or filler to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.420 
areas of thick plaster or filler to
weigh<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.930> canvas<00:00:36.350> down<00:00:36.560> or<00:00:36.800> break<00:00:36.980> off<00:00:37.220> or

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
weigh the canvas down or break off or

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.920 
weigh the canvas down or break off or
damage<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.820> surface<00:00:40.390> for<00:00:41.390> areas<00:00:41.720> with<00:00:41.840> a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
damage the surface for areas with a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.200 
damage the surface for areas with a
sharper<00:00:42.320> angle<00:00:42.350> or<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:42.860> larger<00:00:43.250> lump<00:00:43.460> then<00:00:44.030> we

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
sharper angle or a larger lump then we

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.150 
sharper angle or a larger lump then we
can<00:00:44.360> use<00:00:44.480> thinner<00:00:44.750> strips<00:00:45.020> of<00:00:45.170> card<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:46.070> as

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
can use thinner strips of card and as

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.280 
can use thinner strips of card and as
well<00:00:46.340> see<00:00:46.490> here<00:00:46.700> shortly<00:00:46.940> after<00:00:47.900> using<00:00:48.170> these

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
well see here shortly after using these

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.650 
well see here shortly after using these
large<00:00:48.650> pieces<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.190> card<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.150> more<00:00:50.300> gentle

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
large pieces of card to the more gentle

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.960 
large pieces of card to the more gentle
slope<00:00:50.990> across<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.350> body<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.980> then<00:00:52.400> crisscross

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
slope across a body and then crisscross

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.930 
slope across a body and then crisscross
with<00:00:53.300> smaller<00:00:53.630> strips<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.860> work<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.580> area<00:00:55.760> of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
with smaller strips to work the area of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:15.740 
with smaller strips to work the area of
the<00:00:56.060> breasts

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.060 

once<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:16.930> has<00:01:17.110> been<00:01:17.230> achieved<00:01:17.380> then<00:01:17.830> we<00:01:17.920> can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
once this has been achieved then we can

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.310 
once this has been achieved then we can
take<00:01:18.250> paper<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:19.150> this<00:01:19.300> case<00:01:19.570> newsprint<00:01:20.080> and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
take paper in this case newsprint and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.980 
take paper in this case newsprint and
lay<00:01:21.010> it<00:01:21.130> across<00:01:21.220> those<00:01:21.730> strips<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.570> gradually

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
lay it across those strips and gradually

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.540 
lay it across those strips and gradually
build<00:01:23.140> them<00:01:23.320> up<00:01:23.440> with<00:01:23.710> ordinary<00:01:23.980> wallpaper

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
build them up with ordinary wallpaper

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.970 
build them up with ordinary wallpaper
paste<00:01:24.730> or<00:01:25.000> thin<00:01:25.180> down<00:01:25.360> PVA<00:01:25.840> glue<00:01:25.930> if<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.830> want

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
paste or thin down PVA glue if you want

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.260 
paste or thin down PVA glue if you want
something<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.280> bit<00:01:27.310> stronger<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.880> course<00:01:28.120> you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
something a bit stronger of course you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.460 
something a bit stronger of course you
could<00:01:28.420> use<00:01:28.450> ordinary<00:01:29.290> cartridge<00:01:29.740> paper<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
could use ordinary cartridge paper this

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.290 
could use ordinary cartridge paper this
in<00:01:35.590> itself<00:01:35.920> forms<00:01:36.370> quite<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.610> strong<00:01:36.940> surface

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
in itself forms quite a strong surface

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.360 
in itself forms quite a strong surface
almost<00:01:38.290> as<00:01:38.380> strong<00:01:38.500> as<00:01:38.560> plastic<00:01:39.070> because

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
almost as strong as plastic because

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.550 
almost as strong as plastic because
after<00:01:39.670> all<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.000> PVA<00:01:40.570> glue<00:01:40.660> is<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.170> form<00:01:41.440> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
after all the PVA glue is a form of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:56.110 
after all the PVA glue is a form of
liquid<00:01:41.710> plastic

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.550 

and<00:01:57.120> once<00:01:57.300> these<00:01:57.510> initial<00:01:57.870> coats<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.350> dry

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and once these initial coats are dry

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
and once these initial coats are dry
giving<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.190> very<00:01:59.430> hard<00:01:59.700> surface<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.780> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
giving that very hard surface then we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.630 
giving that very hard surface then we
can<00:02:00.990> start<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> build<00:02:01.650> up<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.950> surface<00:02:02.370> layers

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
can start to build up the surface layers

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.359 
can start to build up the surface layers
of<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:03.060> plaster<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.780> filler<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.290> use<00:02:04.890> polyfill

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
of the plaster or filler I use polyfill

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
of the plaster or filler I use polyfill
and<00:02:05.490> most<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.690> there<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:06.869> other

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and most of the time but there are other

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600 
and most of the time but there are other
powders<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.650> fillers<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
powders and fillers you can use if you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.740 
powders and fillers you can use if you
want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> make<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.060> more<00:02:09.179> plastic<00:02:09.600> or

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
want to make them more plastic or

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.870 
want to make them more plastic or
pliable<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.500> add<00:02:10.740> some<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.039> PVA<00:02:11.400> glue<00:02:11.490> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
pliable and add some more PVA glue to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.640 
pliable and add some more PVA glue to
this<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.450> only<00:02:12.660> really<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.050> better<00:02:13.320> but<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this but only really to do better but it

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
this but only really to do better but it
makes<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> more<00:02:14.100> pliable<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:15.180> less

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
makes it more pliable and it's not less

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.650 
makes it more pliable and it's not less
likely<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.690> break<00:02:15.870> off

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.360 

here<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.680> me<00:02:22.830> building<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
here you can see me building the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
here you can see me building the
modeling<00:02:23.760> by<00:02:23.910> hand<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.420> are<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:24.630> fingers<00:02:24.990> at

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
modeling by hand and are my fingers at

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.870 
modeling by hand and are my fingers at
first<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:25.980> I'll<00:02:26.100> finish<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.610> tool

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
first then I'll finish with a tool

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.870 
first then I'll finish with a tool
called<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.510> kidney<00:02:27.870> spoon<00:02:31.310> as<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.640> here

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
called a kidney spoon as you see here

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.460 
called a kidney spoon as you see here
this<00:02:33.030> kidney<00:02:33.420> shaped<00:02:33.660> piece<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.020> metal<00:02:34.320> is

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
this kidney shaped piece of metal is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.230 
this kidney shaped piece of metal is
very<00:02:34.860> useful<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.430> smoothing<00:02:35.640> those<00:02:35.910> pottery

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
very useful for smoothing those pottery

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.290 
very useful for smoothing those pottery
clay<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.900> sculpture<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.100> not<00:02:38.940> only<00:02:39.120> in

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
clay and sculpture like this not only in

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.910 
clay and sculpture like this not only in
metal<00:02:39.600> but<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.050> buy<00:02:40.200> these<00:02:40.260> spoons<00:02:40.710> in

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
metal but you can buy these spoons in

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.840 
metal but you can buy these spoons in
plastic<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.580> wood<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.880> well<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.520> using<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
plastic and in wood as well so using a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.700 
plastic and in wood as well so using a
combination<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> kidney<00:02:45.990> spoon<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
combination of the kidney spoon and a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.380 
combination of the kidney spoon and a
sponge<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.430> get<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.550> very<00:02:47.790> very<00:02:48.090> smooth

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
sponge we can get a very very smooth

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.600 
sponge we can get a very very smooth
surface<00:02:48.660> after<00:02:49.470> which<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.040> take<00:02:50.250> some<00:02:50.430> white

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
surface after which I take some white

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.490 
surface after which I take some white
emulsion<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.300> case<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.810> emulsion<00:02:52.260> with

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
emulsion in this case and emulsion with

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.010 
emulsion in this case and emulsion with
two<00:02:52.710> coats<00:02:52.980> -<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> whole<00:02:53.700> surface<00:02:54.210> ready<00:02:54.810> for

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
two coats - a whole surface ready for

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.410 
two coats - a whole surface ready for
the<00:02:55.080> final<00:02:55.440> painting<00:02:58.490> even<00:02:59.490> at<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.880> stage<00:03:00.180> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the final painting even at this stage is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.510 
the final painting even at this stage is
still<00:03:00.600> possible<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> add<00:03:01.260> more<00:03:01.440> material<00:03:02.070> of

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
still possible to add more material of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.790 
still possible to add more material of
course<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.000> match<00:03:03.300> emulsion<00:03:03.900> will<00:03:04.080> take<00:03:04.260> more

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
course the match emulsion will take more

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.260 
course the match emulsion will take more
filler<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> surface<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.850> want<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
filler on the surface if you want it to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.490 
filler on the surface if you want it to
especially<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.170> additional

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
especially if you have the additional

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710 
especially if you have the additional
PVA<00:03:07.920> glue<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> here<00:03:09.210> you<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
PVA glue with it here you can see the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
PVA glue with it here you can see the
final<00:03:09.990> work<00:03:10.290> ready<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> be<00:03:11.190> put<00:03:11.400> back<00:03:11.430> into<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
final work ready to be put back into the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.820 
final work ready to be put back into the
rest<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> panels<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.080> natural<00:03:13.440> painting

rest of the panels the natural painting

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.510 
rest of the panels the natural painting
started<00:03:15.560> once<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.710> had<00:03:16.860> fitted<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.220> smaller

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
started once I had fitted the smaller

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.160 
started once I had fitted the smaller
panel<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.150> see<00:03:18.420> I've<00:03:18.510> built<00:03:18.750> over<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
panel you can see I've built over the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.320 
panel you can see I've built over the
shoulders<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.010> added<00:03:20.340> further<00:03:20.580> texturing<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
shoulders and added further texturing to

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.930 
shoulders and added further texturing to
link<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.630> into<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> rest<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.230> painting

here's<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> brief<00:03:24.210> glimpse<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> final<00:03:25.140> work

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
here's a brief glimpse as a final work

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.780 
here's a brief glimpse as a final work
but<00:03:25.620> now<00:03:25.770> let's<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.160> how<00:03:26.340> all<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.640> this

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
but now let's see how all of this

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.350 
but now let's see how all of this
