days were probably more in check first
and<00:00:37.860> last<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> Peter's<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> yes<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.340> I

couldn't<00:00:42.450> leave<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.809> went<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> pub<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
couldn't leave it I went to the pub with

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.240 
couldn't leave it I went to the pub with
my<00:00:44.040> certainty<00:00:44.370> what's<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> draw<00:00:45.180> lie<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.250> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
my certainty what's the draw lie and I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.979 
my certainty what's the draw lie and I
think<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.910> were<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> last<00:00:48.210> ones<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> hat

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
think we were the last ones at the hat

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.049 
think we were the last ones at the hat
and<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> West<00:00:50.010> haven't<00:00:50.340> shown<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> last

and the West haven't shown the last

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
and the West haven't shown the last
throughout<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> hats<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.710> build-up<00:00:53.039> was

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
throughout the hats so the build-up was

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700 
throughout the hats so the build-up was
was<00:00:53.520> amazing<00:00:54.000> I've<00:00:54.270> hadn't<00:00:54.629> realized<00:00:54.930> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
probably all the luck over the recent

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.710 
probably all the luck over the recent
seasons<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> said<00:01:47.970> Tottenham<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
seasons like I said Tottenham and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
seasons like I said Tottenham and
Everton<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> kneecap<00:01:50.310> awareness<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
Everton and even a kneecap awareness the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
Everton and even a kneecap awareness the
last<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.780> we've<00:01:51.930> had<00:01:52.049> seems<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.439> Stoke

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
last time you we've had seems like Stoke

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
last time you we've had seems like Stoke
something<00:01:53.549> before<00:01:53.850> yeah<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.720> we've

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
something before yeah but I think we've

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
something before yeah but I think we've
also<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.409> pretty<00:01:55.530> lean<00:01:55.860> years<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.340> well

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
also had some pretty lean years as well

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980 
also had some pretty lean years as well
where<00:01:56.850> we've<00:01:57.030> been<00:01:57.149> knocked<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> first

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
where we've been knocked out the first

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
where we've been knocked out the first
round<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.560> drawn<00:01:58.829> away<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.159> side<00:01:59.520> then

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
round would be drawn away to side then

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.240 
round would be drawn away to side then
doorway<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.149> Colchester<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.890> haven't<00:02:02.159> had

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
doorway to Colchester so we haven't had

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.709 
doorway to Colchester so we haven't had
the<00:02:02.280> best<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.670> drawers<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.090> fact<00:02:03.299> poorly<00:02:03.630> at

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the best of drawers in fact poorly at

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.450 
the best of drawers in fact poorly at
home<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.049> I'd<00:02:04.380> reinvest<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.250> great

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
home one I'd reinvest really a great

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
home one I'd reinvest really a great
draw<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.299> obviously<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> winnable<00:02:07.049> game

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
draw but obviously was a winnable game

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.139 
draw but obviously was a winnable game
and<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.829> give<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> West<00:02:08.520> came<00:02:08.670> away<00:02:08.879> with

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and here we give it West came away with

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
and here we give it West came away with
some<00:02:09.390> sexy<00:02:10.020> winnable<00:02:10.379> game

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
some sexy winnable game

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.039 
some sexy winnable game
I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.939> West<00:02:12.120> Ham<00:02:12.299> now<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.840> very

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
I think the West Ham now is very

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.390 
I think the West Ham now is very
different<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.439> west<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.860> perhaps<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.280> few

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
different to the west and perhaps a few

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.679 
different to the west and perhaps a few
years<00:02:14.579> ago<00:02:14.790> when<00:02:15.030> they<00:02:15.150> were<00:02:15.180> much<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:16.040> suppose

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
years ago when they were much I suppose

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.710

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
little smile will last for I think what

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.790 
little smile will last for I think what
it<00:04:23.000> does<00:04:23.180> do<00:04:23.420> it<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:24.020> gives<00:04:24.200> us<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.470> little<00:04:24.590> bit

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
it does do it just gives us a little bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.410 
it does do it just gives us a little bit
of<00:04:24.950> breathing<00:04:25.160> space<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:25.910> think<00:04:26.090> if<00:04:26.210> might

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
of breathing space and I think if might

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.990 
of breathing space and I think if might
just<00:04:26.690> want<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.900> bring<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.290> replacement

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
just want to bring in a replacement

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.320 
just want to bring in a replacement
alone<00:04:29.000> replacement<00:04:30.190> for<00:04:31.190> Jamie<00:04:31.730> Cureton<00:04:31.970> I

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
alone replacement for Jamie Cureton I

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.380 
alone replacement for Jamie Cureton I
think<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.020> makes<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.350> more<00:04:33.440> possible<00:04:33.650> now

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390

think that makes it more possible now
you<00:04:35.390> know<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.840> budget<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.470> we<00:04:36.680> set<00:04:36.890> the
