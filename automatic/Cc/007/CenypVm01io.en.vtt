00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.960
 I was waiting for confirmation to not 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.060
 to be like a asshole asshole 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.650
 make a video with a masturbator 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.380
 compulsive on YouTube you will be 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.870
 asking why I have control of 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.460
 the xbox 360 good so to be able 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.460
 improve this news because you have to 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.649
 see with this console all the gamers 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.440
 what are you seeing me is a jet 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.010
 of enormous pleasure to inform you that 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 finally it has been confirmed since 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.329
 a few days ago this is not new that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.399
 microsoft is going to with dropper to reveal 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.039
 information about your new consoles 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.989
 on the eighth generation of consoles 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.929
 about his bet in the eighth generation 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.170
 of many consoles are saying that they 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:08.560
 you can call xbox 720 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.689
 because evolution is the truth I do not 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.490
 I think I have this name I do not know that 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.610
 it will have to be seen according to what they have said 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.520
 this console is going to be six times more 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.320
 powerful that the current machine six 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.110
 Sometimes that means that you 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.759
 they have to imagine games like skyrim or 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:32.050
 as batman arkham city 'and try to 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.310
 visualize a graphic section 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.570
 six times more powerful you what 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.480
 can you imagine well for you 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.120
 worth the redundancy because I can not 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.940
 the truth I do not have an idea of how 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.160
 bestial will be but I am completely 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.350
 sure that with the machine too 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.360
 has to come certain accessories that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.220
 they have nothing to do with microsoft them 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.280
 I explain for those who still do not know a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.680
 good TV maybe even those that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.500
 they want to get the juice out of this new 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.390
 beast that is to come that is by 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.759
 give up microsoft 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.100
 you have to have you have to have a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.170
 3D TV are already selling 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.550
 these things in the future and that's what 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.970
 it was necessary they are already selling 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.710
 televisions in three languages 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.900
 do not rush ok 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.970
 do not go into hysteria do not start 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.850
 sell your xbox because it glimpses that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.920
 be mackinnon see the light 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.120
 as early as November of the year 2013 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.250
 remember that the current generation of 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.950
 consoles there are still many many 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.580
 many cubes to be taken out by not to say 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.740
 less grand theft auto 5 is going to come out 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.810
 possibly this year that is, either 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.970
 they begin to make ideas still missing 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.810
 A little time is missing a little time 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.910
 the processor is going to be a bestiality and 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.490
 it's not just the graphics that 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.200
 they will improve but also the possibility 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.150
 of making worlds more immersive more 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.160
 great for example what I want in 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.740
 a grand theft auto 'in addition to having a 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.860
 much bigger city with areas 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.900
 rural is that I can enter all 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.110
 the buildings or at least in one 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.870
 huge amount of structures and also 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.310
 can destroy them if that runs 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.020
 can be related to history 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.240
 of the game because history can not 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.390
 follow normally if you throw a bomb 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.390
 atomic 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.379
 nobody knows what's coming but the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.349
 truth is that we are all excited 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.239
 as dead who discover the straw by 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.930
 very first in life 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.620
 so I leave you with this question 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.470
 before they go to finish off with straws 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.750
 mental 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.940
 glimpsing visualizing the day when 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.950
 can play with this console if you 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.260
 you were a Microsoft executive with the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.050
 enough power what name would you put 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.290
 you to the new xbox do not be a son of a bitch 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.260
 I'm not going to answer 720 because that would be 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.570
 copied and there are many people who say that 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.940
 it's going to be called like that use your imagination and 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.180
 please in the comment box of the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.170
 work tell me how do you think it's going to 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.750
 get the new microsoft xbox up 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.050
 then and pass all and all good 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.050
 nights
