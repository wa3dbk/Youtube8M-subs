said we went eight feet in the air you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830 
said we went eight feet in the air you
know<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.240> were<00:01:36.360> suspending

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
know I all I know is we were suspending

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.090 
know I all I know is we were suspending
the<00:01:36.960> air<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> long<00:01:37.380> I've<00:01:37.770> never<00:01:37.860> been

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the air for a long I've never been

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.090 
the air for a long I've never been
suspended<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> bass<00:01:38.970> boat<00:01:39.000> completely

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
suspended in a bass boat completely

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
suspended in a bass boat completely
airborne<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.420> dangling<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.570> air<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.960> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
airborne and dangling in the air and I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.340 
airborne and dangling in the air and I
actually<00:01:43.590> saw<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> boat<00:01:44.250> separating<00:01:44.880> from<00:01:45.000> us

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
actually saw the boat separating from us

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.300 
actually saw the boat separating from us
apparently<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.560> far<00:01:46.920> enough<00:01:47.009> away<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
apparently it was far enough away that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
apparently it was far enough away that
it<00:01:47.549> pulled<00:01:47.790> my<00:01:47.909> kill<00:01:48.149> switch<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.630> kind<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it pulled my kill switch so we kind of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
it pulled my kill switch so we kind of
hovered<00:01:49.290> above<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> boat<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> can

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
hovered above the boat if you can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.130 
hovered above the boat if you can
imagine<00:01:50.700> ship<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> trajectory<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.899> boat

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
imagine ship the trajectory of the boat

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
imagine ship the trajectory of the boat
at<00:01:52.259> us<00:01:52.380> were<00:01:52.560> about<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> same<00:01:53.180> i'm<00:01:54.180> guessing

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
at us were about the same i'm guessing

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
at us were about the same i'm guessing
we<00:01:54.750> cleared<00:01:55.049> all<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> other<00:01:55.439> boat<00:01:55.680> wakes<00:01:55.920> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
we cleared all the other boat wakes that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.709 
we cleared all the other boat wakes that
were<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.759> guys<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.939> came<00:01:57.299> through<00:01:57.570> there

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
were the guys that came through there

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
were the guys that came through there
later<00:01:57.899> said<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> stack<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.250> three

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
later said there was a stack of three

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.149 
later said there was a stack of three
waves<00:01:59.909> speed<00:02:00.420> three<00:02:00.689> big<00:02:00.869> wigs<00:02:01.140> all<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.009> think

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
waves speed three big wigs all I think

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.560 
waves speed three big wigs all I think
he<00:02:02.219> did<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.549> launched<00:02:02.820> off<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> first

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
he did was we launched off the first

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200 
he did was we launched off the first
hung<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.800> air<00:02:04.830> went<00:02:05.790> past<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.120> other

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
hung in the air went past the other

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.060 
hung in the air went past the other
waves<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.720> this<00:02:07.200> point<00:02:07.440> became<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.710> blur<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.950> me

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
waves at this point became a blur to me

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.950 
waves at this point became a blur to me
I<00:02:08.369> took<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.850> big<00:02:09.060> deep<00:02:09.210> breath<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.570> because<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
I took a big deep breath in because I

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.650 
I took a big deep breath in because I
saw<00:02:10.259> water<00:02:10.590> below<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.730> saw<00:02:11.910> both<00:02:12.180> below<00:02:12.480> but

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
saw water below and I saw both below but

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.750 
saw water below and I saw both below but
it<00:02:13.050> was<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> blur<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.560> water<00:02:13.890> boat<00:02:14.160> river<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.730> I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it was a blur of water boat river and I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.100 
it was a blur of water boat river and I
just<00:02:14.940> thought<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.300> going<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.720> river<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
just thought I'm going in the river I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.180 
just thought I'm going in the river I
thought<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.440> sure<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
thought for sure I was going in the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.150 
thought for sure I was going in the
river<00:02:17.370> heard<00:02:17.880> my<00:02:18.000> partner's<00:02:18.390> scream<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.160> I'm

river heard my partner's scream and I'm
sure<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.400> probably<00:02:20.700> scream<00:02:21.030> 2<00:02:21.270> out<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> fear<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
sure I probably scream 2 out of fear and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.290 
sure I probably scream 2 out of fear and
as<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:23.010> hit<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.390> hit<00:02:24.720> down<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:26.280> jarred<00:02:26.850> me<00:02:27.090> I
