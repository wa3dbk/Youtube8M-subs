00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
findings were first we have what every

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.920 
findings were first we have what every

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
single taylor acoustic guitar ships with

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.630 
single taylor acoustic guitar ships with
it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:51.190> elixir<00:00:51.610> Nano<00:00:51.970> web<00:00:52.180> 80/20<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
it is elixir Nano web 80/20 and that

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.390 
it is elixir Nano web 80/20 and that
gauge<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:55.000> 12<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.690> 53<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:56.350> light<00:00:56.500> gauge<00:00:56.740> so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
gauge is 12 to 53 so light gauge so

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.590 
gauge is 12 to 53 so light gauge so
we're<00:00:57.490> going<00:00:57.580> to<00:00:57.700> put<00:00:57.820> these<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:58.360> see<00:00:58.540> how

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
we're going to put these on and see how

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:18.749 
we're going to put these on and see how
this<00:00:58.720> out<00:01:16.289> so<00:01:17.289> here<00:01:17.439> we<00:01:17.530> have<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.100> elixir<00:01:18.340> 80

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
this out so here we have the elixir 80

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.179 
this out so here we have the elixir 80
20<00:01:19.270> nano<00:01:19.509> webs<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.079> we're<00:01:20.859> going<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.069> do<00:01:21.130> it

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
20 nano webs and we're going to do it

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:41.070 
20 nano webs and we're going to do it
with<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.340> pic<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.759> see<00:01:22.030> how<00:01:22.119> they<00:01:22.210> sound

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.940 

so<00:01:42.080> that's<00:01:42.200> what<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.350> sound<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.530> with<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.770> pick

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
so that's what it sound like with a pick

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.590 
so that's what it sound like with a pick
one<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.640> try<00:01:43.790> doing<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.060> little<00:01:44.210> bit<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.390> finger

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
one we try doing a little bit of finger

00:01:44.600 --> 00:02:02.680 
one we try doing a little bit of finger
picking<00:01:44.870> stuff<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.580> there<00:02:02.120> you<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.360> it

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
picking stuff and there you have it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.330 
picking stuff and there you have it
elixir<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.260> nano<00:02:03.470> web<00:02:03.740> 80<00:02:04.310> 20s<00:02:05.620> well<00:02:06.620> since<00:02:07.220> we

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
elixir is nano web 80 20s well since we

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.490 
elixir is nano web 80 20s well since we
just<00:02:07.520> tried<00:02:07.640> elixirs<00:02:08.060> 8020<00:02:08.720> which<00:02:08.960> elixir<00:02:09.410> is

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
just tried elixirs 8020 which elixir is

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.140 
just tried elixirs 8020 which elixir is
a<00:02:09.530> coded<00:02:09.950> string<00:02:10.190> we're<00:02:10.580> going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.760> move<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:11.000> to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
a coded string we're going to move on to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.950 
a coded string we're going to move on to
the<00:02:11.240> Martin<00:02:11.630> 80<00:02:12.140> 20s<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:12.920> these<00:02:13.400> are<00:02:13.960> uncoated

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
the Martin 80 20s and these are uncoated

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.240 
the Martin 80 20s and these are uncoated
so<00:02:15.350> we're<00:02:15.470> going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.650> try<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:15.920> hear<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
so we're going to try and hear the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.580 
so we're going to try and hear the
difference<00:02:16.580> between<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.940> coated<00:02:17.510> 8020<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.230> an

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
difference between a coated 8020 and an

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:37.660 
difference between a coated 8020 and an
uncoated<00:02:18.890> 8020<00:02:19.460> see<00:02:19.910> how<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.060> sound<00:02:36.670> all

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
uncoated 8020 see how they sound all

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.370 
uncoated 8020 see how they sound all
right<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.300> last<00:02:38.450> time<00:02:38.660> we<00:02:38.720> heard<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.990> elixir

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
right so last time we heard the elixir

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.040 
right so last time we heard the elixir
and<00:02:39.500> nano<00:02:39.740> wet<00:02:39.950> yeah<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.640> elixir<00:02:40.820> Nano<00:02:41.150> m8020

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
and nano wet yeah the elixir Nano m8020

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.870 
and nano wet yeah the elixir Nano m8020
s<00:02:42.110> which<00:02:42.530> are<00:02:42.680> coated<00:02:42.920> string<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.490> now<00:02:43.730> we're

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
s which are coated string and now we're

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.940 
s which are coated string and now we're
going<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> listen<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.750> what<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.050> Martin<00:02:45.470> 8020

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
going to listen to what the Martin 8020

00:02:45.950 --> 00:03:05.290 
going to listen to what the Martin 8020
sound<00:02:46.190> like<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:46.670> they're<00:02:46.820> picked

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.190 

so<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.390> was<00:03:06.599> listening<00:03:06.690> how<00:03:06.900> they're<00:03:07.050> going<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so I was listening how they're going to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.150 
so I was listening how they're going to
how<00:03:07.410> they're<00:03:07.530> going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.680> sound<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.040> their

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
how they're going to sound with their

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:26.570 
how they're going to sound with their
finger<00:03:08.400> picked<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:25.380> they<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.769> Martin<00:03:26.430> 80

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
finger picked and they have Martin 80

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.500 
finger picked and they have Martin 80
20s<00:03:27.739> alright<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.370> now<00:03:29.550> we're<00:03:29.760> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.910> go<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
20s alright so now we're going to go to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.670 
20s alright so now we're going to go to
a<00:03:30.540> little<00:03:30.720> bit<00:03:30.870> different<00:03:31.230> type<00:03:31.319> of<00:03:31.349> string

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
a little bit different type of string

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.670 
a little bit different type of string
called<00:03:32.190> phosphor<00:03:32.670> bronze<00:03:32.810> now<00:03:33.810> these<00:03:34.530> are

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
called phosphor bronze now these are

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.110 
called phosphor bronze now these are
elixirs<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.190> again<00:03:35.400> they're<00:03:35.549> coated<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.030> then

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
elixirs so again they're coated and then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030 
elixirs so again they're coated and then
the<00:03:36.330> Nano<00:03:36.480> webs<00:03:36.720> let's<00:03:37.200> put<00:03:37.680> them<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.860> see<00:03:38.010> how
