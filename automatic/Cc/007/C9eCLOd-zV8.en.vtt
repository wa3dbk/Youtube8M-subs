00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.930
 Despair count heart 's verse 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.759

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.180
 destroyed by the shit out of you 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.949
 love life means you bite me this 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.260
 bound hands that I carry in me 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.420
 But days after day will be harder 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.680
 I wonder what would you do 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.040

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.079

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.489
 stinging throat sting it goes here 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.809
 not just measuring my strength I mean only 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.590

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.270
 break 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.010
 I begin to forget that 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.140
 packs for rent man the devil 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.480
 begins to defeat me by dazzling 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.700
 everything excludes my eyes pull the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:01.210
 plug out to start flying 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.400
 as if my body is full of dear mum 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.200
 I just want to have love the cold 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.810
 reality transfers to mine 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.580
 mentality it the Dutch lives after 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.440
 the paradise i stand in my dreams 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.690

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.460
 turn off cold turn 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.800
 helpless body help i feel 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.050
 raped as a small child looks 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.510
 so delivered from the cold world without 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.910
 just fall and fall into a hole without 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.979
 Ground hold me catch me or 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.479
 educated society where your life is 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 is measured but you have money 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.150
 I have to eat so that others can eat 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.070
 suffering hunger is the court it is 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.440
 law that all people have to suffer 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.960
 we do not have enough for the rest 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.030
 learned to repurpose what we have it 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.880
 a gift that you breathe the world again 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.979
 let that foretell you burn 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.170
 something does not stop with me and 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.360
 do not look at it is because yours and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.920
 my veins are the same blood I am 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.899
 a human second or third grade 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.940
 because I have slogan to survive me 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.369
 hate it so that would have been appreciated 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.560
 give everything I own except mine 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.600
 last shirt except for the rest of it me 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.410
 incomprehensible as we agreed for 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.410
 the law
