00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.339 
to show you my new game for the LED boy
game<00:00:08.610> system<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.300> was<00:00:09.389> working<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:09.750> I've

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
game system that I was working on I've

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.100 
game system that I was working on I've
tried<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:11.040> emulate<00:00:12.000> Super<00:00:12.509> Mario<00:00:12.719> Brothers

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
tried to emulate Super Mario Brothers

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.970 
tried to emulate Super Mario Brothers
using<00:00:13.559> an<00:00:13.650> 8x8<00:00:14.040> pixel<00:00:14.519> screen<00:00:15.590> we<00:00:16.590> go<00:00:16.740> over

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
using an 8x8 pixel screen we go over

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.420 
using an 8x8 pixel screen we go over
here<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> LED<00:00:18.119> boy<00:00:18.830> now<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.100> no<00:00:20.279> way

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
here is the LED boy now this is no way

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
here is the LED boy now this is no way
near<00:00:20.609> finish<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.090> game<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.630> thought<00:00:21.840> I'd

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
near finish this game but I thought I'd

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.650 
up to at the moment there's no bad guys
to<00:00:27.269> kill<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.289> run<00:00:28.470> along<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.980> jump

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
to kill but you can run along and jump

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
to kill but you can run along and jump
you<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.720> either<00:00:30.960> walk<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.740> hold<00:00:31.980> down

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you can either walk or you can hold down

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.940 
you can either walk or you can hold down
the<00:00:32.250> B<00:00:32.369> button<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.910> run<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.079> jump<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the B button to run you can jump up you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.790 
the B button to run you can jump up you
can<00:00:35.100> hit<00:00:35.219> blocks<00:00:35.809> if<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.989> land<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> thing

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
can hit blocks if you land down a thing

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700 
can hit blocks if you land down a thing
and<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.280> diary<00:00:38.460> lose<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> life<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.559> just

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and your diary lose a life and it just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.690 
and your diary lose a life and it just
resets<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:43.100> I'll<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
resets like that I'll make it so that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
resets like that I'll make it so that
when<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> hit<00:00:45.480> blocks<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> actually<00:00:46.170> get

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
when you hit blocks you actually get

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.540 
when you hit blocks you actually get
stuff<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> blocks<00:00:48.829> like<00:00:49.829> fire<00:00:50.160> power

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
stuff out of the blocks like fire power

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.410 
stuff out of the blocks like fire power
and<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:54.949> know<00:00:55.949> other<00:00:56.610> things<00:00:56.730> I'll<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and I know other things I'll think of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.910 
and I know other things I'll think of
them<00:00:57.510> when<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> its<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
them when I get to its that that's the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
them when I get to its that that's the
next<00:00:59.070> level<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
next level now so this is the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.180 
next level now so this is the
underground<00:01:00.539> level<00:01:00.930> again<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.070> hit

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
underground level again you can hit

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.010 
underground level again you can hit
blocks<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.910> jump<00:01:05.150> run<00:01:06.150> long<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.600> things<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
blocks and jump run long do things you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.280 
blocks and jump run long do things you
can<00:01:07.140> hit<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.380> blocks<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.939> can

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
can hit these blocks up here and you can

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
can hit these blocks up here and you can
try<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> jump<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:14.119> I<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.689> game

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
try and jump up there I think the game

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
try and jump up there I think the game
would<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.049> lots<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.470> fun<00:01:16.799> once<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.280> some

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
would be lots more fun once I get some

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.340 
would be lots more fun once I get some
bad<00:01:17.610> guys<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.689> jump<00:01:19.200> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
bad guys in there so you can jump on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.749 
bad guys in there so you can jump on
them<00:01:20.630> again<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.869> die<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.380> does<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> comes

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
them again if I die just does that comes

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630 
them again if I die just does that comes
back<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:25.250> still<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> few<00:01:26.580> bugs

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
back to here it's still got a few bugs

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.120 
back to here it's still got a few bugs
you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.810> back<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> other<00:01:28.110> way<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you can go back the other way if you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.899 
you can go back the other way if you
wanted<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:30.920> still<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.340> much<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> work<00:01:32.670> in

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
wanted to still very much a work in

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
wanted to still very much a work in
progress<00:01:33.150> I've<00:01:33.479> only<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.810> four<00:01:34.110> levels

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
progress I've only got four levels

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.580 
progress I've only got four levels
actually<00:01:35.180> working<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> moment<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.930> I've

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually working at the moment and I've

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
actually working at the moment and I've
I<00:01:38.180> i<00:01:39.590> replicate<00:01:40.590> these<00:01:41.100> levels<00:01:41.490> from<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I i replicate these levels from the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.480 
I i replicate these levels from the
original<00:01:42.479> Super<00:01:42.810> Mario<00:01:42.899> Brothers<00:01:43.380> game

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.440 

so<00:01:47.490> kinda<00:01:47.790> looks<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.030> same

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so kinda looks the same

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
so kinda looks the same
just<00:01:48.780> very<00:01:49.140> pixelated<00:01:51.320> there's<00:01:52.320> plenty<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
just very pixelated there's plenty of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.690 
just very pixelated there's plenty of
memory<00:01:53.460> within<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.119> microcontroller<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.700> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
memory within this microcontroller to to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
memory within this microcontroller to to
actually<00:01:57.030> put<00:01:57.240> every<00:01:57.780> single<00:01:57.960> level<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.680> there

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
actually put every single level on there

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
actually put every single level on there
I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.790> there's<00:01:59.940> about<00:02:00.030> 32<00:02:00.630> levels<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I think there's about 32 levels in the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.219 
I think there's about 32 levels in the
original<00:02:01.590> Mario<00:02:01.860> Brothers<00:02:02.190> game<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:03.300> there's

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
original Mario Brothers game and there's

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
original Mario Brothers game and there's
plenty<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.830> be<00:02:04.920> able<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
plenty to be able to do that so this is

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
plenty to be able to do that so this is
the<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.840> last<00:02:10.020> castle<00:02:10.410> stage<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.160> I'm

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the that last castle stage and then I'm

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.650 
the that last castle stage and then I'm
just<00:02:11.520> about<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.850> get<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.239> where<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.510> have
