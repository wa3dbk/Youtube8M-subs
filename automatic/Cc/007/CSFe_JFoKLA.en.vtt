minifigures are coming in from Chris
production<00:00:35.610> studios<00:00:35.940> um<00:00:36.800> as<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.040> see

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
production studios um as you can see

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.240 
production studios um as you can see
there<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.579> significant<00:00:39.570> difference<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
there is a significant difference in the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.360 
there is a significant difference in the
amount<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.700> overall<00:00:42.570> figures<00:00:43.070> between<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
amount of overall figures between the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.990 
amount of overall figures between the
SIP<00:00:44.700> Empire<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.170> Galactic<00:00:46.680> Republic<00:00:47.000> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
SIP Empire and the Galactic Republic the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
SIP Empire and the Galactic Republic the
only<00:00:48.180> reason<00:00:48.539> why<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.140> huge<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
only reason why that's a huge thing is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.569 
only reason why that's a huge thing is
because<00:00:50.510> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.949> Mandalorians

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because as you can see the Mandalorians

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.439 
because as you can see the Mandalorians
make<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> big<00:00:53.969> part<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:56.239> section<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
make a big part of that section of the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.500 
make a big part of that section of the
army<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.390> that's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
army there so you can see that that's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
army there so you can see that that's
where<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> troops<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.710> coming<00:01:01.739> from

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
where most of the troops are coming from

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
where most of the troops are coming from
and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> bounty

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and then here you have the bounty

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
and then here you have the bounty
hunters<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> smugglers<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:06.030> my<00:01:06.750> bad

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
hunters and the smugglers or my bad

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
hunters and the smugglers or my bad
bounty<00:01:07.650> hunters<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.729> agents<00:01:09.090> as

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bounty hunters and then the agents as

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
bounty hunters and then the agents as
well<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> troops<00:01:10.439> themselves<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.100> my
