00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
which is what I really like I not

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.690 
which is what I really like I not
normally<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> fan<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.690> cases<00:01:52.520> here<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
normally a fan of cases here it is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.570 
normally a fan of cases here it is
without<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> case<00:01:54.980> so<00:01:55.980> it<00:01:56.190> doesn't<00:01:56.490> really

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
without the case so it doesn't really

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.160 
without the case so it doesn't really
add<00:01:56.700> too<00:01:56.940> much<00:01:57.090> bulk<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.600> looks<00:01:57.810> almost<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
add too much bulk it looks almost the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.670 
add too much bulk it looks almost the
same<00:01:58.260> right<00:01:58.650> here<00:02:00.080> take<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.260> at<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.470> case

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
same right here take a look at the case

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.960
