00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.840
 their 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 I say yes 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.650
 francisco na condem is the legendary saga of the company that both 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.230
 popularized in its versions for arcade machines and the console 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.620
 mega megabra in the early 90's returns now turned into a 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.030
 cycle for him he wanted santa and you had and are three 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.030
 under the name of copper max seen painter 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.970
 this new chapter comes loaded with important changes that differentiate 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.499
 of the deliveries of yesteryear 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.039
 and that despite the fact that, in general terms, we are still trying to win 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.959
 its playability that is more similar to that of an action game in third 

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:50.010
 person 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 in which first of all the fighting will prevail over any other 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.149
 element very much in line with that seen in titles like conan ogier in lisbon with 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.179
 which also shares a very similar theme 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.320
 respect to sortu is not that in this occasion all the protagonism rests in 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.660
 a single character 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.900
 specifically the exuberant amazons country read for although the barbarian and the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.240
 dwarf the other two great heroes already known from the saga 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.950
 after its appearance in some parts of the adventure 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 this will always have a merely secondary role and in no case 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 they can be controlled directly by the player 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.910
 also the game is full of winks nostalgic to the previous ones 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.729
 deliveries 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.670
 like for example the nice green and blue gnomes to which we can 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.090
 hit to get valuable magical booties and food 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.400
 recover health 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.000
 if we are skilled enough to corral laws since this results 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 again quite elusive and catch 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.150
 And that's not all, since in the same way the different beasts 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.320
 We could use it as a saddle they are also present in the game 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.220
 having them now of several classes each with their own abilities 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.540
 Exclusive 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 that will allow us to create chaos among enemies 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.950
 although it is important to keep in mind that yes 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.110
 these can also be used by the adversaries and become our 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 against 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.940
 if we are knocked down 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.649
 technically the title shows us an excellent graphic finish that highlights 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.299
 Due to its good level of detail, the scenarios, despite the fact that 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.479
 have destructible elements and the great modeling of all the 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.860
 characters being without a doubt 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.470
 the best care section of all fire 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.780
 in addition you also have to make special mention to the abundance of blood and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.779
 violence that we will see on the screen 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.460
 Iran should not enter more wildly 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.780
 the different body parts of the enemies during the clashes 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:18.029
 however its main problem lies in the repetitiveness of its mechanics makes 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.939
 that our protagonist does not have a combat system too deep 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.629
 that evolves during the course of the game indicating 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.129
 basically ap two kinds of attack some combos 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.199
 and to the use and a few magics so at the beginning it is very fun to play 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.749
 but that as the story progresses this sensation will decrease each time 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.759
 more until falling into the most absolute monotony 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:45.029
 although this one even more harmed by the total identity in the development of 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 the phases of the game 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.249
 Finally, it is worth mentioning that the title does not include any online multiplayer mode 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.280
 neither from the same console 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.780
 something that being a bit of this genre would have been very appreciated 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:08.009
 being your options restricted we are history as right there is a way 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.679
 challenge in which we can return to occupy any level already overcome being 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.499
 possible also to get it different contents to unlock as per 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.539
 warm example nova clothes with new weapons 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.749
 ap 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.559
 for frames 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:26.689
 hopefully 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.749
 issues 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:30.770
 eclipsed those who chÃ¡vez cui mazzitelli well 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.560
 In conclusion we are facing a game that is far from achieving quality and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.930
 depth if you had gone talk to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.650
 it remains as a title that will go through the catalog of x box after sixty

 cyclist and they are three without attracting too much attention from the users 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.430
 having some pretty incomprehensible points 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.280
 as for example the scarce repertoire of movements 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.590
 having a single playable character 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.120
