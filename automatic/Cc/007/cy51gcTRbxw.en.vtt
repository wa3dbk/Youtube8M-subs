00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
prospect of a forge mode and years of

war now if you're unfamiliar with Forge
from<00:00:39.239> Halo<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:39.930> sure<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.469> many<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.579> are

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
from Halo I'm sure very many of you are

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.380 
from Halo I'm sure very many of you are
not<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.719> familiar<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.550> would

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
not I'm familiar with it so I would

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
not I'm familiar with it so I would
imagine<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.079> everyone<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> least

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
imagine that everyone has a least

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
imagine that everyone has a least
experienced<00:00:47.789> forge<00:00:48.059> mode<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.629> some<00:00:48.899> degree

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
experienced forge mode to some degree

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
experienced forge mode to some degree
but<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.190> experienced<00:00:50.820> forge

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
but if you have not experienced forge

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.600 
but if you have not experienced forge
mode<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.719> basically<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.860> map<00:00:53.399> editor

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
mode it is basically a map editor

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
mode it is basically a map editor
experience<00:00:54.600> very<00:00:55.350> light<00:00:55.649> editing<00:00:56.070> tools<00:00:56.660> for

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
experience very light editing tools for

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.650 
experience very light editing tools for
the<00:00:58.379> halo<00:00:58.680> community<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.280> produce<00:00:59.489> maps<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the halo community to produce maps and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.789 
the halo community to produce maps and
in<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.199> cases<00:01:01.410> new<00:01:01.859> game<00:01:02.129> modes<00:01:02.629> now<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.049> think

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
in some cases new game modes now I think

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.289 
in some cases new game modes now I think
this<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.070> pretty<00:01:05.400> beneficial<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.090> Gears

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this would be pretty beneficial to Gears

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
this would be pretty beneficial to Gears
of<00:01:06.360> War<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.290> know<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.810> capable<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
of War I don't know what is capable in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
of War I don't know what is capable in
the<00:01:10.890> time<00:01:11.130> span<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.430> they've<00:01:11.700> been<00:01:11.850> given

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the time span that they've been given

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
the time span that they've been given
since<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> set<00:01:13.380> date<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
since we don't have a set date but I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.800 
since we don't have a set date but I
definitely<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> community

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
definitely think that the community

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.109 
definitely think that the community
would<00:01:16.110> benefit<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:17.159> forge<00:01:18.920> opportunity

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
would benefit from a forge opportunity

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.640 
would benefit from a forge opportunity
for<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.380> wide<00:01:22.979> array<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.369> reasons<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
for I think a wide array of reasons but

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
for I think a wide array of reasons but
I'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> err<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> side<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I'm going to err on the side of the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.780 
I'm going to err on the side of the
competitive<00:01:27.409> community<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> talk<00:01:29.220> about<00:01:29.549> my

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
competitive community and talk about my

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.630 
competitive community and talk about my
experiences<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.689> their<00:01:31.140> DLC<00:01:31.890> plan<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.490> how

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
experiences with their DLC plan and how

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.330 
experiences with their DLC plan and how
they've<00:01:32.850> rolled<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> past<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
they've rolled it out in the past and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
they've rolled it out in the past and
why<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.549> has<00:01:35.759> been<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> negative<00:01:36.420> effect<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
why it has been a negative effect on you

why it has been a negative effect on you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
for Gears of War 3 I doubt the season

for Gears of War 3 I doubt the season
pass<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.180> think<00:01:42.960> i<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.560> judgment

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
pass i don't think i got it for judgment

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.510 
pass i don't think i got it for judgment
and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.170> season<00:01:46.530> passes<00:01:46.740> existed

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and I don't think season passes existed

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
and I don't think season passes existed
in<00:01:47.700> Gears<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.509> War<00:01:48.630> two<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.290> ended<00:01:49.500> up

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
in Gears of War two but I ended up

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370 
in Gears of War two but I ended up
playing<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> DLC<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:52.110> seems

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
playing the DLC there but there seems

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.139 
playing the DLC there but there seems
like<00:01:52.500> there's<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.950> common<00:01:53.460> pattern<00:01:53.909> with

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
like there's this common pattern with

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.310 
like there's this common pattern with
DLC<00:01:54.829> that<00:01:55.829> maybe<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.549> mandated<00:01:57.390> by<00:01:57.390> Microsoft

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
DLC that maybe as mandated by Microsoft

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.889 
DLC that maybe as mandated by Microsoft
or<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> publisher<00:01:59.219> or<00:01:59.250> whoever<00:01:59.670> where<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
or the publisher or whoever where you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
or the publisher or whoever where you
know<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.320> map<00:02:01.560> content<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.219> only<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.490> like

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
know for map content you only get like

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.289 
know for map content you only get like
three<00:02:02.880> maps<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:04.189> gears<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.340> war<00:02:05.549> seems<00:02:06.090> like

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
three maps and gears of war seems like

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.590 
three maps and gears of war seems like
they've<00:02:06.509> done

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
they've done

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.670 
they've done
and<00:02:08.729> basically<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:10.270> server-side<00:02:10.869> map

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and basically like server-side map

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.030 
and basically like server-side map
updates<00:02:12.370> whenever<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.140> DLC<00:02:14.800> so

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
updates whenever you get a DLC so

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.970 
updates whenever you get a DLC so
basically<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:16.030> can<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.390> those<00:02:16.600> maps<00:02:16.980> on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
basically you can have those maps on

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.660 
basically you can have those maps on
your<00:02:18.040> hard<00:02:18.520> drive<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:20.140> when<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.580> you

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
your hard drive but when you and you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.430 
your hard drive but when you and you
have<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.270> connected<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> internet<00:02:23.290> in

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
have to be connected to the internet in

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.020 
have to be connected to the internet in
order<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.770> use<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.370> when<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.610> take<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
order to use it so when you take it to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.490 
order to use it so when you take it to
land<00:02:25.300> even<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.020> your<00:02:26.110> hard<00:02:26.319> drive

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
land even if you have your hard drive

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.070 
land even if you have your hard drive
and<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.739> has<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> maps<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.780> can't

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
and it has the maps on it you can't

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.490 
and it has the maps on it you can't
actually<00:02:29.319> load<00:02:29.920> those<00:02:30.190> maps<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.819> land

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
actually load those maps on a land

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.400 
actually load those maps on a land
environment<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.790> for<00:02:34.239> those<00:02:34.410> unfamiliar

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
environment so and for those unfamiliar

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.680 
environment so and for those unfamiliar
with<00:02:35.530> land<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:35.920> basically<00:02:36.190> where<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:37.569> know

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
with land it's basically where you know

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.180 
with land it's basically where you know
competitive<00:02:38.230> tournaments<00:02:38.650> are<00:02:38.739> played<00:02:38.950> so

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
competitive tournaments are played so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.830 
competitive tournaments are played so
like<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> Haifa<00:02:39.730> station<00:02:40.060> or<00:02:40.180> MLG<00:02:40.630> tournament

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
like a Haifa station or MLG tournament

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.729 
like a Haifa station or MLG tournament
those<00:02:41.170> are<00:02:41.290> all<00:02:41.410> land<00:02:41.769> networked<00:02:42.640> systems<00:02:43.739> so

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
those are all land networked systems so

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.330 
those are all land networked systems so
Gears<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.069> War<00:02:45.190> has<00:02:46.000> not<00:02:46.630> been<00:02:46.989> very<00:02:47.380> friendly

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
Gears of War has not been very friendly

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.050 
Gears of War has not been very friendly
for<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.269> Lansing<00:02:49.860> traditionally<00:02:50.860> because<00:02:51.640> of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
for the Lansing traditionally because of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.960 
for the Lansing traditionally because of
how<00:02:52.510> they've<00:02:52.750> done<00:02:52.959> dlc<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.739> gated<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.550> behind

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
how they've done dlc and gated it behind

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.870 
how they've done dlc and gated it behind
the<00:02:55.900> internet<00:02:56.350> basically<00:02:56.700> verification<00:02:57.700> of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the internet basically verification of

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.270 
the internet basically verification of
your<00:02:58.209> your<00:02:58.930> hard<00:02:59.110> drive<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.709> files<00:02:59.920> there

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
your your hard drive in the files there

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.490 
your your hard drive in the files there
I'm<00:03:00.519> thinking<00:03:01.180> that's<00:03:01.299> what<00:03:01.420> happens<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.560> I

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
I'm thinking that's what happens so I

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.650 
I'm thinking that's what happens so I
have<00:03:05.500> always<00:03:05.830> been<00:03:06.250> limited<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.730> whatever<00:03:07.540> the

have always been limited to whatever the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.940 
have always been limited to whatever the
default<00:03:09.030> maps<00:03:10.030> are<00:03:10.319> whenever<00:03:11.319> I've<00:03:11.470> gone<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
default maps are whenever I've gone to

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.449 
default maps are whenever I've gone to
tournaments<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:14.380> know<00:03:14.500> that's<00:03:14.799> fine<00:03:15.220> and

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
dandy for a little while but I feel like

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.110

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
know a set number but it's good to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430 
know a set number but it's good to
switch<00:03:33.250> things<00:03:33.400> up<00:03:33.850> whether<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.690> be<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.109> show

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
off in this case for forge you know

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.280 
off in this case for forge you know
community-driven<00:03:39.190> projects<00:03:40.000> or<00:03:40.450> better

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
community-driven projects or better

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.650 
community-driven projects or better
design<00:03:41.829> projects<00:03:42.670> for<00:03:42.880> competitive<00:03:43.420> play

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
design projects for competitive play

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.319 
design projects for competitive play
whatever<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.560> case<00:03:44.739> may<00:03:44.980> be<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.280> think<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.970> by

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
whatever the case may be I think that by

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.199 
whatever the case may be I think that by
having<00:03:46.600> forge<00:03:47.170> in<00:03:47.410> there<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.950> allows<00:03:48.459> for<00:03:48.910> more

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
having forge in there it allows for more

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.300 
having forge in there it allows for more
creativity<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.260> more<00:03:52.140> variable<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.650> think

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
creativity and more variable I think

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.140 
creativity and more variable I think
play<00:03:54.670> then<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:56.290> variety<00:03:57.010> i<00:03:57.040> should<00:03:57.310> say<00:03:57.519> play

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
play then a variety i should say play

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.069 
play then a variety i should say play
then<00:03:59.140> without<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.310> i<00:04:00.640> would<00:04:01.630> like<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.900> see

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
then without so i would like to see

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.020 
then without so i would like to see
forge<00:04:02.410> use<00:04:02.799> because<00:04:03.070> I've<00:04:03.430> seen<00:04:03.459> how<00:04:03.819> it's

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
forge use because I've seen how it's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.390 
forge use because I've seen how it's
done<00:04:04.209> for<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.750> halo<00:04:05.019> community<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:06.370> think

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
done for the halo community and I think

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.890 
done for the halo community and I think
there's<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:07.780> know<00:04:07.810> oftentimes<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:10.600> takes<00:04:10.780> a

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
there's you know oftentimes a it takes a

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.259 
there's you know oftentimes a it takes a
while<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.380> get<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:12.190> point<00:04:12.910> at<00:04:13.090> which<00:04:13.209> you

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
while to get to the point at which you

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.199 
while to get to the point at which you
can<00:04:13.540> accept<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.049> map<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.590> then<00:04:14.769> move<00:04:14.980> on<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:16.000> I

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
can accept a map and then move on but I

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.129 
can accept a map and then move on but I
like<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.459> having<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.639> user<00:04:18.940> driven<00:04:19.329> content

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
like that having the user driven content

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.449 
like that having the user driven content
helps<00:04:20.680> keep

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
helps keep

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.080 
helps keep
the<00:04:21.519> game<00:04:21.930> alive<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.440> fresh<00:04:24.090> which

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
the game alive and fresh which

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.110 
the game alive and fresh which
oftentimes<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:26.289> not<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.680> case<00:04:27.120> when

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
oftentimes is not the case when

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.779 
oftentimes is not the case when
developers<00:04:28.900> are<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.199> a<00:04:29.530> schedule<00:04:29.699> you<00:04:30.699> know

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
developers are on a schedule you know

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.550 
developers are on a schedule you know
every<00:04:31.000> three<00:04:31.240> months<00:04:31.569> or<00:04:31.690> every<00:04:31.750> six<00:04:32.259> months

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
every three months or every six months

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.650 
every three months or every six months
they<00:04:32.650> can<00:04:32.830> release<00:04:33.099> updates<00:04:33.520> because<00:04:33.729> that's

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
they can release updates because that's

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.210 
they can release updates because that's
the<00:04:34.930> pace<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.259> which<00:04:35.410> they're<00:04:35.650> going<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.069> work

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
the pace of which they're going to work

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.920 
the pace of which they're going to work
versus<00:04:36.789> you<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.150> forge<00:04:37.449> mode<00:04:37.690> or

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
versus you know a forge mode or

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.300 
versus you know a forge mode or
something<00:04:38.169> like<00:04:38.259> that<00:04:38.319> where<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.220> know

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
something like that where you know

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.499 
something like that where you know
people<00:04:39.340> can<00:04:39.639> throw<00:04:39.819> together<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.240> quick

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
people can throw together a quick

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.420 
people can throw together a quick
sandbox<00:04:41.020> map<00:04:41.319> and<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.680> might<00:04:41.889> be<00:04:42.069> the<00:04:42.190> best

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
sandbox map and that might be the best

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.210 
sandbox map and that might be the best
map<00:04:42.759> ever<00:04:42.789> right<00:04:43.599> like<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.199> think<00:04:44.830> there's<00:04:45.130> a

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
map ever right like I think there's a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.790 
map ever right like I think there's a
certain<00:04:45.400> element<00:04:45.759> of<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.800> definitely

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
certain element of that that definitely

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.570 
certain element of that that definitely
helps<00:04:48.310> keep<00:04:48.639> your<00:04:48.819> community<00:04:49.560> very

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
helps keep your community very

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580 
helps keep your community very
interested<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.669> invested<00:04:52.030> in<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.690> game<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.259> I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
interested and invested in the game so I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.920 
interested and invested in the game so I
would<00:04:54.400> err<00:04:54.580> on<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.820> side<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.120> having<00:04:55.630> Forge

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
would err on the side of having Forge

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.499 
would err on the side of having Forge
for<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:57.310> competitive<00:04:57.820> community<00:04:58.300> but<00:04:58.479> I

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
for the competitive community but I

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.680 
for the competitive community but I
think<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:58.900> also<00:04:58.990> obviously<00:04:59.560> benefits<00:05:00.099> the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
think it also obviously benefits the

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.120 
think it also obviously benefits the
community<00:05:01.690> not<00:05:02.199> invested<00:05:02.740> in<00:05:02.860> in<00:05:03.039> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
community not invested in in the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.460 
community not invested in in the
competitive<00:05:03.580> scene<00:05:03.820> because<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.780> those<00:05:04.900> you

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
competitive scene because of those you

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.170 
competitive scene because of those you
know<00:05:05.590> some<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:05.800> those<00:05:05.949> same<00:05:06.160> reasons<00:05:06.430> right<00:05:06.849> so

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
know some of those same reasons right so

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.379 
know some of those same reasons right so
you<00:05:08.169> know<00:05:08.259> some<00:05:08.590> people<00:05:08.620> don't<00:05:08.949> buy<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:10.150> dlc

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
you know some people don't buy the dlc

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.860 
you know some people don't buy the dlc
right<00:05:11.229> like<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.909> DLC<00:05:13.270> traditionally<00:05:13.720> has

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
right like and the DLC traditionally has

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.140 
right like and the DLC traditionally has
been<00:05:13.900> separated<00:05:14.590> by<00:05:14.680> playlist<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:16.030> know

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
been separated by playlist so you know

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.839 
been separated by playlist so you know
we<00:05:16.570> might<00:05:16.720> have<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:18.039> know<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.159> million<00:05:18.460> people

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
we might have you know a million people

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.300 
we might have you know a million people
playing<00:05:19.150> but<00:05:20.020> only<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.470> fraction<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.039> has

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
playing but only a fraction of that has

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.890 
playing but only a fraction of that has
the<00:05:21.490> DLC<00:05:21.880> well<00:05:22.120> everyone<00:05:22.419> else<00:05:22.569> is<00:05:22.720> in<00:05:22.870> a

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
the DLC well everyone else is in a

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.290 
the DLC well everyone else is in a
separate<00:05:23.319> playlist<00:05:23.800> so<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.669> know<00:05:24.909> I<00:05:24.940> think

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
separate playlist so you know I think

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.850 
separate playlist so you know I think
that<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.690> playlist<00:05:26.199> separation<00:05:26.740> has

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
that the playlist separation has

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.040 
that the playlist separation has
definitely<00:05:27.220> been<00:05:27.490> something<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.030> has<00:05:28.270> hurt

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
definitely been something that has hurt

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.439 
definitely been something that has hurt
the<00:05:29.650> community<00:05:30.159> in<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> long<00:05:30.699> run<00:05:30.729> of<00:05:30.970> having

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
the community in the long run of having

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.450 
the community in the long run of having
all<00:05:31.659> these<00:05:31.990> different<00:05:32.259> types<00:05:32.620> of<00:05:32.860> things

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
all these different types of things

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.089 
all these different types of things
available<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.889> know<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.039> don't

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
available and you know I don't

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.920 
available and you know I don't
necessarily<00:05:36.789> know<00:05:36.909> if<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:37.120> forged<00:05:37.479> playlist

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
necessarily know if a forged playlist

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.189 
necessarily know if a forged playlist
ads<00:05:38.199> or<00:05:38.979> deters<00:05:39.400> from<00:05:39.759> that<00:05:39.969> you<00:05:40.210> know<00:05:40.240> if<00:05:40.599> it

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
ads or deters from that you know if it

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.629 
ads or deters from that you know if it
has<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.440> go<00:05:41.560> through<00:05:41.590> an<00:05:41.860> approval<00:05:42.070> process

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
has to go through an approval process

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.820 
has to go through an approval process
with<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.270> studio<00:05:43.599> but<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.080> certainly<00:05:44.289> adds<00:05:44.500> a

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
with the studio but it certainly adds a

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.370 
with the studio but it certainly adds a
lot<00:05:44.949> more<00:05:45.190> content<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.780> game<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.199> keeps

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
lot more content to the game and keeps

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.930 
lot more content to the game and keeps
people<00:05:47.560> interested<00:05:48.070> and<00:05:48.430> hopefully<00:05:48.580> doesn't

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
people interested and hopefully doesn't

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.700 
people interested and hopefully doesn't
put<00:05:49.240> out<00:05:49.270> any<00:05:49.570> level<00:05:49.960> designers<00:05:50.380> but<00:05:50.500> at<00:05:50.620> the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
put out any level designers but at the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.680 
put out any level designers but at the
same<00:05:50.889> time<00:05:51.070> I<00:05:51.130> think<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:52.060> get<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.270> see<00:05:52.509> some

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
same time I think you get to see some

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.990 
same time I think you get to see some
people<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:53.110> become<00:05:53.440> very<00:05:53.800> skilled<00:05:54.280> at<00:05:54.699> what

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
people that become very skilled at what

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.550 
people that become very skilled at what
they<00:05:55.180> do<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.449> people<00:05:55.810> want<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.169> see<00:05:56.320> more<00:05:56.500> of

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
they do and people want to see more of

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.310 
they do and people want to see more of
their<00:05:56.800> maps<00:05:57.070> so<00:05:57.539> you<00:05:58.539> know<00:05:58.630> from<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.960> casual

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
their maps so you know from a casual

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.779 
their maps so you know from a casual
standpoint<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.889> get<00:06:00.039> people<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.340> end<00:06:00.669> up

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
standpoint you get people that end up

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.879 
standpoint you get people that end up
being<00:06:00.849> really<00:06:01.180> creative<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:02.349> can<00:06:02.560> show<00:06:02.740> off

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
being really creative that can show off

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.409 
being really creative that can show off
some<00:06:02.919> of<00:06:03.159> their<00:06:03.340> creative<00:06:03.699> abilities<00:06:04.210> through

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
some of their creative abilities through

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.279 
some of their creative abilities through
either<00:06:04.750> modes<00:06:05.229> you<00:06:05.860> know<00:06:05.979> creative<00:06:06.580> modes<00:06:06.849> or

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
either modes you know creative modes or

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.790 
either modes you know creative modes or
new<00:06:08.289> map<00:06:08.560> designs<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:10.090> then<00:06:10.479> they<00:06:11.289> also<00:06:11.469> get

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
new map designs and then they also get

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.459 
new map designs and then they also get
to<00:06:12.580> play<00:06:12.940> different<00:06:13.570> maps<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.259> have<00:06:14.349> an

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
to play different maps and have an

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.200 
to play different maps and have an
experience<00:06:14.560> there<00:06:15.219> that<00:06:15.789> they<00:06:15.940> wouldn't

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
experience there that they wouldn't

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.149 
experience there that they wouldn't
otherwise<00:06:16.360> have<00:06:16.840> when<00:06:17.590> you<00:06:17.889> know<00:06:17.979> people

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
otherwise have when you know people

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.020 
otherwise have when you know people
introduced<00:06:18.990> DLC<00:06:19.990> so<00:06:20.289> I<00:06:20.530> think<00:06:21.159> that<00:06:21.370> it<00:06:21.789> would

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
introduced DLC so I think that it would

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.899 
introduced DLC so I think that it would
be<00:06:22.090> an<00:06:22.300> interesting<00:06:22.539> and<00:06:23.110> compelling

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
be an interesting and compelling

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.060 
be an interesting and compelling
argument<00:06:24.909> for<00:06:25.030> a<00:06:25.570> forge<00:06:25.990> mode<00:06:26.289> and<00:06:26.560> years<00:06:26.979> of

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
argument for a forge mode and years of

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.189 
argument for a forge mode and years of
war<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.669> don't<00:06:28.449> know<00:06:28.630> if<00:06:28.810> it's<00:06:29.020> necessarily

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
war I don't know if it's necessarily

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.890 
war I don't know if it's necessarily
something<00:06:29.770> that<00:06:29.919> they<00:06:30.130> would<00:06:30.279> even<00:06:30.370> consider

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
something that they would even consider

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.659 
something that they would even consider
but<00:06:31.900> you<00:06:32.589> know<00:06:32.680> I<00:06:32.740> think<00:06:32.830> that<00:06:33.159> it<00:06:33.279> adds<00:06:33.430> quite

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
but you know I think that it adds quite

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:34.830 
but you know I think that it adds quite
a<00:06:33.789> bit<00:06:34.029> too

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
a bit too

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.710 
a bit too
the<00:06:35.620> longevity<00:06:36.310> of<00:06:36.669> the<00:06:36.820> gameplay<00:06:37.210> and<00:06:37.449> I

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
the longevity of the gameplay and I

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.480 
the longevity of the gameplay and I
think<00:06:37.780> that's<00:06:37.960> really<00:06:38.139> important<00:06:38.770> so<00:06:38.980> hope

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
think that's really important so hope

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.790 
think that's really important so hope
