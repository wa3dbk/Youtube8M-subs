00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.090
 good quiksilver we are here in the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.790
 episode in 99 of queens bots and today you 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.680
 i bring the kirby mod is episode 99 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.189
 each one pay 100 candid one way 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.320
 pretty chubby to work the version 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.150
 currently the 1.5 points already to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.120
 enter 1.6 so I'll do video too 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.700
 a little bit summarizing the and nothing house 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.170
 with the mod the world simply 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.360
 just add these nine little things 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.940
 new voucher 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.910
 that would be because that I want is this would be 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.510
 the typical square kirby but I wrote 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.010
 although it leaves me that we do not have the blue the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.430
 green red yellow purple the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 brown the white and the supposedly 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.410
 orange 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.450
 then time they will return to 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.460
 simply that he adds these little bugs 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.520
 can swim are mobiles that can 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.680
 appear randomly and most 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 important that is is to kill those that you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 they can have good they give you things this you 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 give the cookies 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.210
 white that gives you gives us no sugar 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.860
 sugarfree 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.860
 the red is going to rest 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.140
 dt 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.070
 to say something 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.130
 and the advanced ones 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.140
 the orange notes the sticks made of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.140
 blaze a difference of the environment 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.060
 this that nothing nothing I want to see that you will see 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.060
 yellow 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.090
 the blue that has truly caught us and the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 green gives us 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.300
 I believe that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.300
 cow roses for 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.950
 Let's go he wants to die and the kyrie pussy 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.780
 and 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.690
 good 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.380
 Well it is basic for that so do not 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.380
 is 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.060
 pies and then nothing is a pretty mode 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.830
 silly but it's not stupid I do not know if you 're going 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.690
 as you know it so it will not weigh you 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.510
 you put in your minecraft these appear 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.909
 randomly and this one can 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.209
 entertain killing them and killing them then 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.489
 you can simply get food 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.910
 some elements that save you from 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.650
 get if you have the way that the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.060
 truth does not vary much minecraft model 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.220
 quite 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.980
 for the episode let's continue to bring a 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.900
 quite curious and big and pretty way 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.720
 and now I'm just not going to say the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.520
 name for not doing spoilers and nothing we 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.959
 we will see in the next episode I hope 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.849
 that you like the mod comment that you 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.060
