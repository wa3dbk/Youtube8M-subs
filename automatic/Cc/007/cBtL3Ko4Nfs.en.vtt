00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
too deep in the water for you not to do

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
too deep in the water for you not to do
a<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.409> hips<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:38.030> do<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> way

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
a good hips now do it all the way

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
a good hips now do it all the way
vertical<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.590> no<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.640> to

make<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.119> without<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.600> hip<00:01:42.750> snap<00:01:43.020> so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
make it up without a good hip snap so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
make it up without a good hip snap so
until<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.549> roll<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.659> paddle

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
until you can roll up with your paddle
all<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> way<00:01:46.409> vertical<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.520> still<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.060> some

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
all the way vertical you still have some

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
all the way vertical you still have some
work<00:01:48.479> left<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:49.860> hip<00:01:50.040> snap<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
work left to do on your hip snap it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
work left to do on your hip snap it
needs<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.290> habit<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.770> have

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
needs to be so much of a habit and have

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
needs to be so much of a habit and have
enough<00:01:53.130> muscle<00:01:53.399> memory<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.090> remember<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> go

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
enough muscle memory to remember to go

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
enough muscle memory to remember to go
all<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.710> down<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> back<00:01:56.340> head<00:01:56.850> stays<00:01:57.149> in

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
all the way down and back head stays in

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
all the way down and back head stays in
the<00:01:57.450> water<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.920> able<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.219> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the water for you to be able to do it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.600 
the water for you to be able to do it
vertical<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:01.200> test<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:02.130> simple

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
vertical so this test is a very simple

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.219 
vertical so this test is a very simple
test<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.119> lets<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.509> where<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.200> are

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
test that lets you know where you are

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.139 
test that lets you know where you are
with<00:02:04.469> your<00:02:04.590> hip<00:02:04.740> snap<00:02:04.860> next<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:05.909> want<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
with your hip snap next thing we want to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
with your hip snap next thing we want to
do<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.990> able<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> set<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> paddle<00:02:07.860> up

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
do is be able to set the paddle up

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.339 
do is be able to set the paddle up
quickly<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.520> easily<00:02:08.670> every<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.349> now

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
quickly and easily every time now

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.170 
quickly and easily every time now
there's<00:02:10.560> two<00:02:10.739> ways<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
there's two ways to do this one you can

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.790 
there's two ways to do this one you can
push<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.599> flat<00:02:12.959> part<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.470> pad

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
push the flat part of the pad

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.770 
push the flat part of the pad
through<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> water<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:15.030> provides<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.510> lot<00:02:15.660> of

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
through the water that provides a lot of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.810 
through the water that provides a lot of
water<00:02:15.990> resistance<00:02:16.280> let's<00:02:17.280> try<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.520> same

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
water resistance let's try the same

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.510 
water resistance let's try the same
thing<00:02:17.990> slicing<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.080> pedal<00:02:19.440> much<00:02:20.130> easier

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
thing slicing the pedal much easier

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.240 
thing slicing the pedal much easier
right<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.480> our<00:02:21.660> goal<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.170> always<00:02:22.410> slice<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
right so our goal is to always slice the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.830 
right so our goal is to always slice the
paddle<00:02:23.610> into<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> roll<00:02:24.090> position<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.660> quickly

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
paddle into a roll position as quickly

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.500 
paddle into a roll position as quickly
as<00:02:25.140> possible<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.460> way<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> practice<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:27.420> this

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
as possible the way to practice for this

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
as possible the way to practice for this
is<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> tip<00:02:28.050> over<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:29.100> practice

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
is to tip over and just practice

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.010 
is to tip over and just practice
feathering<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.030> slicing<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:30.570> paddle<00:02:30.930> all

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
feathering and slicing your paddle all

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.820 
feathering and slicing your paddle all
over<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.350> place

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
over the place

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.220 
over the place
your<00:02:32.520> objective<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.330> every<00:02:33.720> movement<00:02:33.990> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
your objective is with every movement of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.690 
your objective is with every movement of
the<00:02:34.290> blade<00:02:34.590> whether<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.250> left<00:02:35.460> later

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the right blade that the paddle always

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
the right blade that the paddle always
slices<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.970> flies<00:02:39.630> into<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.020> position<00:02:40.470> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
slices and flies into the position you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.980 
slices and flies into the position you
want<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.100> never<00:02:41.370> pushes<00:02:41.670> water<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.840> is

want and never pushes water this is
called<00:02:43.200> paddle<00:02:43.590> dexterity<00:02:44.160> it's<00:02:44.370> something

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
called paddle dexterity it's something

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.790 
called paddle dexterity it's something
that's<00:02:44.850> extremely<00:02:45.330> helpful<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.500> want<00:02:46.710> to

2<00:02:58.590> section<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.190> roll<00:02:59.400> we've<00:03:00.030> done<00:03:00.300> rolling

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
2 section of the roll we've done rolling

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750 
2 section of the roll we've done rolling
from<00:03:01.020> just<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> side<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> boat<00:03:02.100> we

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
from just to the side of the boat we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.880 
from just to the side of the boat we
never<00:03:02.970> went<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.270> home<00:03:03.480> base<00:03:03.660> did<00:03:03.960> we<00:03:04.080> well

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
never went to home base did we well

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.190 
never went to home base did we well
guess<00:03:05.040> what<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.730> takes<00:03:06.090> about<00:03:06.270> three<00:03:06.720> seconds

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
guess what it takes about three seconds
