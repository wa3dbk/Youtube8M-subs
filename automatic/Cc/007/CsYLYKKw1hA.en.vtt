 the French reaction

 a solution that will be the main area 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.249
 it's a little bridle I imagined it 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 who is a job seeker 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.770
 the first one that is not too strong 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.840
 brian williams 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 for jfk and stopped seeing his footsteps 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 for sure I learned that I was fine 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.570

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.540
 to do 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.660

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 photo archives flash 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.589
 the bush government

 and when there will be a state of law 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.499
 and like outside 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.189
 m ouattara loses 2 08% 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.189
 compared 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.589
