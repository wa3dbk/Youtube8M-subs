you will now keep the exterminator after
the<00:03:43.480> Easter<00:03:43.600> event<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.870> next<00:03:47.020> time<00:03:47.290> I

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
the Easter event so the next time I

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
the Easter event so the next time I
guess<00:03:47.710> is<00:03:47.980> for<00:03:48.220> people<00:03:48.580> who<00:03:48.610> didn't<00:03:49.800> get<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:51.040> do

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
guess is for people who didn't get to do

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.030 
guess is for people who didn't get to do
with<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:52.600> first<00:03:52.870> three<00:03:53.170> times<00:03:53.470> they<00:03:53.920> will

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
with the first three times they will

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.420 
with the first three times they will
restart<00:03:54.900> yeah<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> think<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:57.250> yeah

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
restart yeah I think it's that but yeah

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.060 
restart yeah I think it's that but yeah
we<00:03:58.060> are<00:03:58.209> actually<00:03:58.600> done<00:03:59.200> this<00:03:59.470> guide<00:03:59.740> will<00:03:59.890> be
