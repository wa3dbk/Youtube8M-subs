00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hanging dear friends today want 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 show you 2 interesting patterns on the left 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.219
 we have those goals w8 beyond new 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.520
 and on the right we have standard thl w8 plus 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.840
 these models differ only in this 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.380
 increased processor speed 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.090
 comforted w8 beyond process works with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 by frequency 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 core more precisely each of the four cores 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.780
 processor runs at frequency 1 and 5 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.620
 gigahertz 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.120
 they are delivered in such here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 boxes the only difference is this 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.430
 logo beyond it is not there as well 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 Here is such information on the boxes 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.530
 which tells us the main ones like this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.379
 here are the moments and not that they medication 589 i 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.250
 I really wanted to tell you about these 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.650
 two models and absolutely identical ie 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 they are identical and outwardly they are identical in 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.920
 configuration that is necessary 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.909
 cover book they are identical on the screen 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:22.380
 Pools Honor gorgeous flash drives with 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:26.659
 great angles but all super review 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.930
 the manufacturer decided that the usual 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.850
 normal processor 6589 on full hd 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.829
 the screen is not enough and decided 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.560
 staff all your models 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.229
 models updated processors to me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.360
 it seems 589 let's see what u 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.100
 we got in antutu what tests have 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.490
 we were shown a paradox but mt seems 589 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.470
 in this model here he showed 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.500
 lower scores than usual mtk 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.040
 I do not know what is most likely related to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.009
 firmware from 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.899
 either with some kind of software problem 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.170
 because we took take another 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.220
 and like any other it seems to me 589 you he 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 shows about 13 14 thousand points by 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.760
 main technical characteristics 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 let's go and see 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.709
 what is really 1500 8 megahertz here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.980
 1200 for all other technical 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.519
 characteristics are completely identical 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.379
 same cameras 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.510
 identical amounts of internal memory 16 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.409
 here and there only here is another markup 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.170
 we have a little gigabyte operational 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.579
 there is no memory to distinguish between us 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.069
 more than that there is no firmware 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.640
 The firmware with us and there and there is excellent with 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.190
 factory 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.060
 that is, nowhere even Chinese saw you 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.010
 absolutely no standard settings also 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.900
 As a result, the model is different here 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.230
 there is a manufacturer clearly show that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.400
 Here in this model it is 1 and 5 given 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.769
 in these models 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.599
 exactly 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:11.510
 and what exactly is w8 beyond here it is 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:16.470
 let's set this model aside and see 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.069
 how is this our smartphone that one 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.400
 beats coping with modern games 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.400
 for example we will look 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.700
 with 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.969
 also see how it plays on this 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.969
 most wanted models 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.120
 I will say right away that the games on this model 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.830
 are coming 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.569
 lousy cache and software can be 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.479
 change the firmware on the forums to take 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.610
 forums 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:47.539
 that is, we came here from the factory 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.139
 models in this state, I think that 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.139
 This is bad 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.420
 Chinese stamp 065 89 t shoved it 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.810
 antutu shows 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:12.330
 and go ahead buy buy from 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:14.990
 us but the fact that it was necessary with the firmware 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.170
 gash firmware at least under this software 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.770
 I am disappointed in this in those moments 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.990
 the goal loses much of its 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.950
 analogs 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:33.110
 from the manufacturer juice no umi there too 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:38.030
 this is not a particularly balanced job 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.030
 on the ass all more or less works fine 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:05.650
 otherwise, this model is nothing 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.670
 different from kecil w8 plus that 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.670
 also with full hd screen 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:16.390
 so think what you need is worth 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:22.000
 overpay these here 100 150 hryvnia 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:25.890
 for the model with 1 and 5 gigahertz them each 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.890
 core thank you for the attention of all the good
