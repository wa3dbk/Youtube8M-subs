00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.710
 caresses the cheek does not drop your 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.280
 head like ludo yes what are you doing here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.179
 down I read I'm learning I must 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.950
 shows that I am intelligent even 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.660
 time that gilles beck asylum h - that one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.949
 is on vacation is enjoying my guy I 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.460
 think we'll agree to say 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 that this intro was useless 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 a waste of time but it does not matter 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.429
 short we are on vacation and must 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.750
 simply enjoy 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.399
 there is so much to say about 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 holidays that I will have to sort 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.690
 the stuff between the gestures and the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.410
 words of people on vacation one could 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.149
 make a movie 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.649
 we will start with bars like you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 know it along the beaches or on 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.590
 along the harbor we always have small 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.820
 bars that offer their services 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.829
 you've already noticed that in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 some bars on vacation the price of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.629
 drinks 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 because when you see a coke 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.940
 simple fact 4 euros you put 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.140
 questions 1 there are no limits but 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.640
 we are not happy then suddenly 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 first days of holidays with your 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 buddies you tell me it's good guys I 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.160
 pay my shot take the tubes you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 want it's nice yes but you do 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.949
 less clever when we wait 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.780
 arrive with the hello addition so that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430
 sir 83 euros for three drinks 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 welcome on vacation mister bah du 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.360
 blow ah no but gays it's a 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.990
 joke everyone pays their fear and then 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.880
 here is 1 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 and there are also good servers so 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.740
 let's talk about it I'm so clumsy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 few days ago I made a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.799
 big blunder I explain 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.420
 so I was in a bar I drank 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.729
 something without messing around 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.820
 in short I ordered a drink a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.950
 waiter gave it to me 15 minutes after 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.460
 knowing that there was nobody in the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.710
 bar 1 the guy was angry with me there he 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.439
 bring me green and he tried to me 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.630
 talk I say try because they 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.270
 were not understandable so already 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.490
 we want to laugh then hello 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 do it to me that will make you without bodies to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.869
 banks every day where these four 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 fishermen or three chips 2 so that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.340
 I'm sorry I do not like him 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.820
 pay it off and that's where I did 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.860
 my gaffe 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.450
 I was with someone and to laugh 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.829
 I said no but it's not a server 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.760
 kouassi they found in the street or 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.950
 what this jester and it turned out 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.060
 this jester he was right behind me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.530
 so I was slightly embarrassed anyway 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 and we had the good idea to ask him 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.910
 ice cubes but the problem is that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.250
 are still waiting for them good I know that 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.530
 waiter it's not an easy job but 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 we recognize the truths between that so 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.130
 it's two glasses of whiskey a glass 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.690
 of inverse lemon pastis for the lady 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.460
 and for the little one a little devil at 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.480
 fraysse and that's good server 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.350
 compared to that it was for your 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.840
 coffee sir lines down I got 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.040
 cheated forgiveness table without comment 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.170
 what is very far is that I know 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.420
 I will never be waiters otherwise 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.670
 would be careful oh the dumpling 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.740
 good if not next to all that there are plenty 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.840
 other things to do on vacation there 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.760
 to go to the beach visit places 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.130
 take pictures and there are plenty 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.260
 other stuff still no I'm kidding but 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.090
 is that during the holidays we drink 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.430
 always a bit more than usual a 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.690
 must admit, but with alcohol must 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.240
 still learn to be reasonable 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.489
 especially on vacation because on vacation 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.230
 there are a lot of people and when 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.090
 you're drunk beaten by that everyone 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.160
 because when you're drunk one you read 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.739
 rarely the smart stuff I know 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.470
 not if it's me but me for example I 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.510
 never finish my mom phrases if you 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.400
 see this video I said that for 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 laugh go I've never seen my life 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.160
 it's not me no 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.030
 yeah I know I have the pieces but 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.310
 good holidays or axa stops too 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.959
 one so this little bonus video is 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.690
 over it was really to make you 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.430
 wait before having two videos in 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.290

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.940
 episode 2 of I need you that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.920

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.959

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.190

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.560
 I hope you will be present for the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.840
 fishpond 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.090
 or to watch it because it's a 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.440

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.110

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.180
 and to thank you I offer you the 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.370
 opportunity to choose my theme for the 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.860

 comments you put the theme with 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.760

 after once a date not these numbers 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.560
 a draw and I will put the theme 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.240
 that someone gave me and why the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.919
 name is because during the video 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.820
 I will thank the one who gave me the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.500
 simply theme 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.500
