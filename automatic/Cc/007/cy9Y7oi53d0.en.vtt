in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> river<00:02:03.079> the<00:02:04.079> way<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.259> does<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> is

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
in the river the way it does that is

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.359 
in the river the way it does that is
through<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.210> vapor<00:02:06.539> treads<00:02:06.960> sole<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.190> see

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
through the vapor treads sole so see

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
through the vapor treads sole so see
it's<00:02:08.490> got<00:02:08.729> some<00:02:08.759> deep<00:02:09.630> tread<00:02:10.110> patterns<00:02:10.590> here

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it's got some deep tread patterns here

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220
