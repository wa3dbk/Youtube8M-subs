absolutely<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.690> there's<00:02:46.870> there's<00:02:47.140> actually

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
absolutely so there's there's actually

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.900 
absolutely so there's there's actually
three<00:02:47.740> parts<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.130> question<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:48.730> let's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
three parts of that question so let's

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.000 
three parts of that question so let's
look<00:02:49.060> at<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.270> three<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.720> first<00:02:49.990> let's<00:02:50.709> look<00:02:50.860> at

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
look at all three so first let's look at

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.730 
look at all three so first let's look at
what<00:02:51.240> bioactive<00:02:52.240> peptides<00:02:52.630> are<00:02:52.810> ba<00:02:53.110> pieces<00:02:53.620> we

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
what bioactive peptides are ba pieces we

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.080 
what bioactive peptides are ba pieces we
call<00:02:53.950> them<00:02:54.100> bioactive<00:02:54.580> peptides<00:02:54.940> are

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
call them bioactive peptides are

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.510 
call them bioactive peptides are
actually<00:02:55.709> extracted<00:02:56.709> they're<00:02:56.890> cleaved<00:02:57.220> from

is the same thing as bioactive peptides

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.130 
is the same thing as bioactive peptides
is<00:03:48.220> essentially<00:03:48.730> like<00:03:48.910> saying<00:03:49.209> gasoline<00:03:49.930> is

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
is essentially like saying gasoline is

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.500 
is essentially like saying gasoline is
the<00:03:50.620> same<00:03:50.799> thing<00:03:51.040> as<00:03:51.190> crude<00:03:51.430> oil<00:03:51.549> now<00:03:52.239> while

one comes from the other they are not

one comes from the other they are not
the<00:03:55.180> same<00:03:55.360> thing<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.019> can't<00:03:56.320> put<00:03:56.470> crude

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the same thing so you can't put crude

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.380 
the same thing so you can't put crude
oil<00:03:56.830> in<00:03:57.040> your<00:03:57.130> car<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.430> expect<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.850> to<00:03:57.940> run<00:03:58.090> no

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
oil in your car and expect it to run no

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.320 
oil in your car and expect it to run no
but<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.680> same<00:03:59.890> thing<00:04:00.130> could<00:04:00.250> be<00:04:00.370> said<00:04:00.400> for<00:04:00.610> for

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
but the same thing could be said for for

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.210 
but the same thing could be said for for
colostrum<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.230> bioactive<00:04:02.470> peptides<00:04:02.980> you

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
colostrum and bioactive peptides you

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.640 
colostrum and bioactive peptides you
could<00:04:03.820> consume<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.450> lot<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.720> colostrum<00:04:05.170> but

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
could consume a lot of colostrum but

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.470 
could consume a lot of colostrum but
essentially<00:04:06.130> you're<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.090> get<00:04:07.209> some<00:04:07.450> of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
essentially you're going to get some of

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.970 
essentially you're going to get some of
the<00:04:07.600> bioactive<00:04:07.840> peptides<00:04:08.410> but<00:04:08.590> not<00:04:08.709> at<00:04:08.860> the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
the bioactive peptides but not at the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.759 
the bioactive peptides but not at the
level<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.610> do<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:10.120> bio<00:04:10.570> growth<00:04:10.870> okay<00:04:11.410> I

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
level that you do in bio growth okay I

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.289 
level that you do in bio growth okay I
think<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.220> third<00:04:12.430> part<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.730> question<00:04:12.970> is

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
think the third part of that question is

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.979 
think the third part of that question is
there<00:04:14.170> there<00:04:14.500> are<00:04:14.739> some<00:04:15.989> misconceptions

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
there there are some misconceptions

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.340 
there there are some misconceptions
about<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.590> truth<00:04:17.830> surrounding<00:04:19.350> colostrum

and<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:24.789> reality<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.330> that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
and the reality is that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.340

there's a lot of variables that could

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
help cause that including his diet the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.830 
help cause that including his diet the
way<00:05:54.430> he's<00:05:54.550> training<00:05:54.940> but<00:05:55.120> it<00:05:55.270> sounds<00:05:55.539> like<00:05:55.599> he

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
way he's training but it sounds like he

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.870 
way he's training but it sounds like he
was<00:05:55.930> making<00:05:56.080> some<00:05:56.380> great<00:05:56.500> improvements<00:05:57.220> so

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
was making some great improvements so

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.159 
was making some great improvements so
I'm<00:05:58.240> not<00:05:58.389> sure<00:05:58.539> I<00:05:58.570> have<00:05:58.599> a<00:05:58.720> complaint<00:05:59.020> about

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
I'm not sure I have a complaint about

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.330 
I'm not sure I have a complaint about
that<00:05:59.320> and<00:05:59.680> I<00:05:59.740> don't<00:05:59.889> know<00:05:59.979> if<00:06:00.039> that<00:06:00.190> was<00:06:00.310> a

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
that and I don't know if that was a

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.790 
that and I don't know if that was a
question<00:06:00.760> or<00:06:00.940> a<00:06:00.970> praise<00:06:01.840> but<00:06:02.440> it<00:06:02.560> sounds<00:06:02.770> like

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
question or a praise but it sounds like

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.320 
question or a praise but it sounds like
he's<00:06:03.010> done<00:06:03.159> some<00:06:03.340> great<00:06:03.520> things<00:06:03.729> so<00:06:03.909> far<00:06:04.120> I

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
he's done some great things so far I

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.089 
he's done some great things so far I
think<00:06:04.389> yes<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.139> essentially<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.680> think<00:06:05.830> the

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
think yes so essentially I think the

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.830 
think yes so essentially I think the
take-home<00:06:06.310> message<00:06:06.909> is<00:06:07.090> whether<00:06:07.690> you're

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
take-home message is whether you're

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.510 
take-home message is whether you're
gaining<00:06:08.110> weight<00:06:08.440> when<00:06:08.770> you're<00:06:09.159> trying<00:06:09.400> to

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
gaining weight when you're trying to

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.670 
gaining weight when you're trying to
bulk<00:06:09.880> or<00:06:10.240> whether<00:06:10.900> you're<00:06:11.110> trying<00:06:11.409> to<00:06:11.500> lose

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
bulk or whether you're trying to lose

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.399 
bulk or whether you're trying to lose
fat<00:06:11.979> by<00:06:12.789> oh<00:06:12.820> girl<00:06:13.150> can<00:06:13.360> benefit<00:06:13.810> both<00:06:14.020> of<00:06:14.260> those

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
fat by oh girl can benefit both of those

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.770 
fat by oh girl can benefit both of those
so<00:06:14.620> it's<00:06:14.680> not<00:06:14.889> just<00:06:15.130> simply<00:06:15.400> for<00:06:15.639> bulking<00:06:16.060> it's

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
so it's not just simply for bulking it's

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.960 
so it's not just simply for bulking it's
not<00:06:16.990> just<00:06:17.199> simply<00:06:17.500> for<00:06:17.680> cutting<00:06:18.039> it's<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.760> good

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
not just simply for cutting it's a good

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.850 
not just simply for cutting it's a good
