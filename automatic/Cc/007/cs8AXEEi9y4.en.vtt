00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.820
 do not 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.609
 look 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.329
 the international music festival of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 Medellín is fundamentally a great 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 opportunity for our city to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.460
 our orchestra the invited musicians 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.870
 soloists and directors that will be 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.290
 with us a great opportunity 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.629
 also for camera groups 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.070
 who are going to make their presentations 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.070
 also in the festival schedule 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.340
 this festival is like the exam that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.799
 we do before the whole community 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.960
 international what the orchestra 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.960
 It really has to show 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.070
 one of the aims of the festival jim 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.690
 it is precisely to bring the whole 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 musical activity everything that the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.650
 orchestra with this festival to young people 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.410
 to the students more when the orchestra 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.760
 has a program that is very important 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.760
 which is called the Philharmonic Academy 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.400
 the festival is one of the most 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.670
 interesting that it has is that 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.470
 let's say let's say a bit about the rite of 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.680
 the concert halls to share 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.050
 with the audience in a way maybe more 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.350
 then we do concerts at 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.350
 fresh air 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.930
 we have to have contextualized what 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.210
 part is the music how to play 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 technically how it should be interpreted 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.580
 it is very important to play and teach here 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.780
 in Colombia basically because there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.440
 a lot of talent and you have to take advantage and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.130
 discover the world of colombia that stops 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.130
 for many people 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.810
 it's mostly in Europe this is known 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.340
 measured music is of great importance 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.069
 because it is everything that moves my world without 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.450
 the music I would not be anything I love the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.450
 music deeply 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.660
 and entrepreneurs must support this 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.340
 fabulous initiative of the festival 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.290
 international music festival in Medellín 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.030
 multiple reasons the first of them is 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.070
 because the only growth that is 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.470
 possible in a society is a 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.510
 that growth harmonious growth 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.980
 harmonic goes without a doubt from the hand 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.870
 of culture and one of the greatest 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.670
 expressions that culture has in 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.010
 Colombia and especially in Medellin 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.380
 it's that international music festival 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 in there without doubt also the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.280
 International Music Festival 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.140
 Medellin to businessmen from the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.870
 mental positioning point of view 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.410
 of their companies is absolutely 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.410
 positive 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.230
 nobody should miss this wonderful 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.930
 event that entrepreneurs join that 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.819

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.800

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.459
 ministry of culture we support this 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.770
 initiative 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.500
 Medellin vibrates with life through 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.900
 the music is still transforming 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.130
 our culture and it becomes an option 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.590
 for hundreds of children and young people I want 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.650
 invite them to participate in the fifth 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.440
 version of the international festival of 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.870
 music from Medellín is an opportunity to 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.489
 very special truth and that's why this is 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.950
 a call for all of us 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.139

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.550

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.229

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.370
 say in the month of September it will be a 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.370
 extraordinary conditions 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.270
 We believe that Medellin has all the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.400
 conditions to strengthen and position 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.300
 a festival that is in the first 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.919
 places in the music scene 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.389
 international and specifically our 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.389
 case in Latin America 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.830
