when<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.300> object<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.690> far<00:02:33.989> away<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.670> takes

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
when the object is far away it takes

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.430 
when the object is far away it takes
around<00:02:35.910> 23<00:02:36.360> seconds<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.750> capture<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.080> name<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
around 23 seconds to capture a name is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.540 
around 23 seconds to capture a name is
so<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.820> when<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.030> must<00:02:39.560> upgrade<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:41.040> problem
