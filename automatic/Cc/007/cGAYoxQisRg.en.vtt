didn't measure it I'm kind of eyeballing
it<00:00:44.980> here<00:00:45.040> because<00:00:45.250> I've<00:00:45.430> made<00:00:45.580> these<00:00:45.730> before

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
it here because I've made these before

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
you add about a cup and a half of

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.440 
you add about a cup and a half of
frosting<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.220> batched<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.820> about<00:00:52.210> enough

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
frosting to batched is about enough

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.600 
frosting to batched is about enough
frosting<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.170> then<00:00:54.040> blend<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.490> together

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
frosting and then blend it together

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.910 
frosting and then blend it together
until<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.570> frosting<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:56.080> evenly<00:00:56.410> distributed

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
until the frosting is evenly distributed

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.920 
until the frosting is evenly distributed
and<00:00:57.070> when<00:00:57.190> you<00:00:57.280> give<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.640> squeeze<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.450> it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
and when you give it a squeeze and it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.540 
and when you give it a squeeze and it
stays<00:00:59.170> together<00:00:59.410> you're<00:00:59.770> probably<00:01:00.010> having

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
stays together you're probably having

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.640 
stays together you're probably having
enough<00:01:00.700> frosting<00:01:00.880> in<00:01:01.300> there<00:01:01.510> but<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.530> will

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
enough frosting in there but you will

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.690 
enough frosting in there but you will
learn<00:01:02.740> from<00:01:02.920> experience<00:01:03.430> when<00:01:03.610> you<00:01:03.670> have

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
learn from experience when you have

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.179 
learn from experience when you have
enough<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.210> when<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:04.479> don't<00:01:05.009> then<00:01:06.009> take<00:01:06.159> a

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
enough and when you don't then take a

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.100 
enough and when you don't then take a
little<00:01:06.369> bit<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.670> mixture<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.270> squeeze

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
little bit of the mixture and squeeze

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.249 
little bit of the mixture and squeeze
together<00:01:08.470> until<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.920> get<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.100> ball<00:01:09.340> shape<00:01:10.259> and

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259
