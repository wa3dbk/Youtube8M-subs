00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can go ahead and create a new group if

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.380 
can go ahead and create a new group if
you'd<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.950> they<00:02:23.879> have<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> bunch<00:02:24.299> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
evo and another thing you might want to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.559 
evo and another thing you might want to
check<00:03:47.069> out<00:03:47.340> how<00:03:47.489> thick<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.060> device<00:03:48.359> is

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
check out how thick this device is

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.259 
check out how thick this device is
before<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.049> purchase<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:50.459> kind<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.090> hard

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
before you purchase it it's kind of hard

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.180 
before you purchase it it's kind of hard
to<00:03:51.329> see<00:03:51.569> here<00:03:51.840> but<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.230> actually<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.530> fairly

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
to see here but it's actually a fairly

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.990 
to see here but it's actually a fairly
thick<00:03:53.669> device<00:03:54.109> will<00:03:55.109> compare<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.799> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
thick device will compare it to the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.080 
thick device will compare it to the
Atrix<00:03:57.000> 4G<00:03:58.040> it's<00:03:59.040> kind<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.310> hard<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.579> see<00:03:59.849> but

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
Atrix 4G it's kind of hard to see but

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.879 
Atrix 4G it's kind of hard to see but
the<00:04:00.239> atrix<00:04:00.599> is<00:04:00.780> actually<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.109> lot<00:04:01.290> thinner<00:04:01.560> and

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
the atrix is actually a lot thinner and

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.099 
the atrix is actually a lot thinner and
the<00:04:02.370> atrix<00:04:02.700> wasn't<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> thin<00:04:03.329> device<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.810> begin

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
the atrix wasn't a thin device to begin

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.140 
the atrix wasn't a thin device to begin
with<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.220> might<00:04:05.579> want<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> check<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:06.090> out

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
with so you might want to check that out

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.780 
with so you might want to check that out
the<00:04:06.389> evo<00:04:06.569> 3d<00:04:06.870> which<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:08.010> photons<00:04:08.459> main

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the evo 3d which is the photons main

the evo 3d which is the photons main
competition<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.569> Sprint<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.079> actually<00:04:10.410> pretty

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
competition on Sprint is actually pretty

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.439 
competition on Sprint is actually pretty
beefy<00:04:11.609> as<00:04:11.910> well<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:13.549> probably<00:04:14.549> is<00:04:14.669> not<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:15.030> huge

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
beefy as well so probably is not a huge

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.219 
beefy as well so probably is not a huge
concern<00:04:15.979> but<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.449> back<00:04:18.630> here<00:04:18.930> let's<00:04:19.139> go

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
concern but in the back here let's go

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.309 
concern but in the back here let's go
ahead<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.530> open<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.039> phone

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:21.319 
ahead and open up the phone

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.430 
ahead and open up the phone
can<00:04:22.319> be<00:04:22.440> difficult<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:23.039> open<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:24.720> does<00:04:25.080> just

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
can be difficult to open up it does just

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.140 
can be difficult to open up it does just
kind<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.919> whole<00:04:26.099> back<00:04:26.340> kind<00:04:26.699> of<00:04:26.759> comes<00:04:26.970> off

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
kind of the whole back kind of comes off
