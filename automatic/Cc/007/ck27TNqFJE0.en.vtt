hello everybody today I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.370> for<00:00:03.120> your<00:00:03.270> smart<00:00:03.510> sprint<00:00:03.870> how<00:00:04.410> to

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.700 
you for your smart sprint how to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.130 
you for your smart sprint how to
accurately<00:00:05.700> measure<00:00:06.000> your<00:00:06.420> rear<00:00:06.810> wheel

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
accurately measure your rear wheel

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.430 
accurately measure your rear wheel
circumference<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.160> really<00:00:08.490> important

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
circumference it's really important

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.600 
circumference it's really important
sometimes<00:00:10.440> depending<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.980> tire<00:00:11.190> brands

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
sometimes depending on the tire brands

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.330 
sometimes depending on the tire brands
you<00:00:11.730> use<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.710> circumference<00:00:13.710> that's<00:00:13.920> listed

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
you use the circumference that's listed

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.039 
you use the circumference that's listed
in<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.639> chart<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.240> give<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.719> not

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
in the chart that we give you is not

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.050 
in the chart that we give you is not
going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.289> match<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.470> therefore<00:00:17.130> your<00:00:17.640> speeds

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
going to match up therefore your speeds

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
going to match up therefore your speeds
and<00:00:18.270> timing<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> look<00:00:19.830> correct

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and timing is not going to look correct

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.290 
and timing is not going to look correct
so<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.230> method<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.310> when

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
so this is a method I like to use when

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.730 
so this is a method I like to use when
I'm<00:00:24.449> helping<00:00:24.660> people<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.170> gearing<00:00:25.619> or

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I'm helping people out with gearing or

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.130 
I'm helping people out with gearing or
whatever<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.910> want<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.750> we're

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
whatever what you want to do is we're

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.080 
whatever what you want to do is we're
measuring<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.890> distance<00:00:29.310> around<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.849> rear

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
measuring the distance around the rear

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.860 
measuring the distance around the rear
tire<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.660> end<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.410> picking<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.870> painters

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
tire I end up picking up some painters

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
tire I end up picking up some painters
tape<00:00:34.579> mainly<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> non<00:00:36.329> stretchy

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
tape mainly because it's a non stretchy

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.250 
tape mainly because it's a non stretchy
tape<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:40.110> can

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
tape so if you get some of this you can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.530 
tape so if you get some of this you can
start<00:00:40.559> by<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.550> sticking<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
start by just sticking it down on the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.380 
start by just sticking it down on the
outside<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> tire<00:00:44.180> hopefully<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.239> doesn't

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
outside of the tire hopefully it doesn't

00:00:45.390 --> 00:01:00.450 
outside of the tire hopefully it doesn't
rip<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.460> like<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.640> understood

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.550 

so<00:01:00.940> if<00:01:01.090> you<00:01:01.210> go<00:01:01.360> around<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:02.050> tire

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.109 

we're<00:01:09.180> capturing<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:11.710> far<00:01:12.070> this<00:01:12.400> goes<00:01:12.880> all

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
we're capturing how far this goes all

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.160 
we're capturing how far this goes all
the<00:01:13.150> way<00:01:13.270> around<00:01:13.860> tear<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.010> off<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:17.020> what

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
the way around tear it off and then what

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.340 
the way around tear it off and then what
you<00:01:17.290> want<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.560> do<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.920> with<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.159> marker<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:20.170> want

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
you want to do is with a marker you want

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.190 
you want to do is with a marker you want
to<00:01:20.470> draw<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> line<00:01:21.100> going<00:01:21.549> across<00:01:22.180> so<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:22.930> we

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
to draw a line going across so that we

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.960 
to draw a line going across so that we
know<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.740> exact<00:01:24.250> start<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.880> stop<00:01:25.149> point<00:01:26.970> then

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
know the exact start and stop point then

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.030 
know the exact start and stop point then
you<00:01:28.600> want<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.840> make<00:01:28.960> sure<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.290> take<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.890> off

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
you want to make sure you take it off

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
you want to make sure you take it off
without<00:01:30.460> ripping<00:01:30.610> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.330 

and<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:41.560> come<00:01:41.770> over<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.189> a<00:01:42.220> table

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.300 

and<00:01:49.600> set<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:51.020> piece<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.590> tape<00:01:51.770> down<00:01:51.800> on<00:01:52.190> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
and set a piece of tape down on the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.100 
and set a piece of tape down on the
table

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
table

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.540 
table
get<00:01:54.110> yourself<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.560> tape<00:01:54.740> measure<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.800> measure

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
get yourself a tape measure and measure

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.150 
get yourself a tape measure and measure
it<00:01:58.850> from<00:01:59.000> mark<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.540> mark<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:02.710> am<00:02:03.710> showing

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
it from mark to mark so I am showing

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.010 
it from mark to mark so I am showing
that<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.790> Tioga<00:02:05.750> 20<00:02:06.080> buy<00:02:06.200> 1.6<00:02:06.830> tire<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:08.020> right

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
that this Tioga 20 buy 1.6 tire is right

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.170 
that this Tioga 20 buy 1.6 tire is right
at<00:02:09.229> 61<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.979> half<00:02:10.160> inches<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.850> what<00:02:17.030> we

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
at 61 and a half inches so and what we

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.620 
at 61 and a half inches so and what we
need<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:19.250> number<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.760> millimeters<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.510> we

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
need is that number in millimeters so we

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.090 
need is that number in millimeters so we
have<00:02:20.780> 61<00:02:22.239> 0.5<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.780> what<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.440> want<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.769> do<00:02:24.920> is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
have 61 0.5 and what you want to do is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.440 
have 61 0.5 and what you want to do is
multiply<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.760> by<00:02:26.600> twenty<00:02:27.110> five<00:02:28.060> point<00:02:29.060> four

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
multiply it by twenty five point four

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.370 
multiply it by twenty five point four
and<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.670> equal<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:37.330> fifteen<00:02:38.330> sixty<00:02:39.140> two

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
and that is equal to fifteen sixty two

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.059 
and that is equal to fifteen sixty two
if<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.550> were<00:02:40.700> using<00:02:40.910> three<00:02:41.300> magnets

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
if we were using three magnets

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.899 
if we were using three magnets
we<00:02:43.760> would<00:02:43.969> divide<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.390> by<00:02:44.569> three<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
we would divide that by three and you

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:57.430 
we would divide that by three and you
would<00:02:47.060> get<00:02:52.090> five<00:02:53.799> 20<00:02:54.799> or<00:02:55.040> 21
