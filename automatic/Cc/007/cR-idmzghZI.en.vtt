00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 I 'll teach you how to make a bracelet 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.879
 of hearts with the disk of how 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.670
 square and it will be as it is here that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.630
 we have here for this we will need two 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.380
 colors of mouse tail meter scissors and 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.270
 the cumin disk 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.930
 the first thing to do is cut 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.090
 the agreed threads we will cut 10 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.520
 threads of gray color to perform the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.580
 side of the bracelet and two threads of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.510
 pink color to realize the heart the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.270
 threads have to have a measure 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.329
 Approximately 50 centimeters 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.070
 once we have them we will help them and 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.260
 we will place on the ccoo disk itself 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.720
 We will place the gray color in 4 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.620
 in 5 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.899
 in 6 in 7 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 in the ey in the lower case f 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.300
 in 14 and 17 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.800
 in life and in the capital letter and the pink 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.230
 We will place the hearts in the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.930
 15 and in 16 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.120
 for this bracelet we say four steps 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.700
 They are very simple to make 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 let's start the first step would be the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 6 uppercase angel and from 5 to g 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.270
 lower case 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.270
 from 15 now from lower case and from 16 to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.670
 uppercase d 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:35.210
 from the capital letter e to the 13 and the f3 the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.360
 lower case 18 and the lowercase ee to 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.070
 8 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.680
 these are the four steps that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.940
 we need to make the bracelet a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.900
 Once we have it that way we have to 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.760
 relocate 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.000
 returning the centuries to the same position 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.920
 from the beginning although the colors do not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.920
 are in the same position of principle 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.330
 once we have them relocated we return 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.980
 to the first step 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.780
 what would be 6 the capital g of 5 a 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.869
 the lowercase g 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.799
 from 15 to the lowercase 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.840
 from 16 to the capital letter of the e 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:22.200
 capital letter 13 from capital letter to 3 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 the lowercase d 18 of the tiny efe 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.820
 8 and will relocate 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.120
 it's like that all the time as you see it 's nothing 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.480
 complicated to make is very beautiful 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 and very simple to do 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.620
 we repeat again from 6 to the agen 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.440
 capital letter of 5 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 for g lowercase from 15 to the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.560
 lowercase from 16 to capital D 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.310
 of the capital letter D of the capital letter 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.990
 to 3 of the lowercase 18 of the efe 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:06.040
 lowercase to 8 and we relocate again 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.250
 I will continue doing a little more 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.050
 until the first hearts are seen 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.050
 agree and we see each other again 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.840
 for we will see to see the first 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.630
 hearts so you can see the way 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.000
 we turn around 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.460
 and here we see that he is already forming the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.070
 first heart of agreement we will continue 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.160
 doing all these steps up 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.500
 get the desired length the most agree 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.660
 or less already done this long but 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.970
 good everything depends on our communion 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.800
 of your measure of agreement once you 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.800
 already have it so that it is not done very 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.360
 extended the video there is not much worth what 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.660
 The only thing that must be done is to dismantle the 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.660
 threads 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.179
 and help them 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.980
 like this website to proceed to do the 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.660
 good bracelet closure and see you 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.590
 in the next tutorial I hope that you 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.250
 I liked it 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.250
 until next time
