the<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.209> know<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.329> little<00:04:10.480> bio<00:04:10.810> description

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
the you know a little bio description

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.740 
the you know a little bio description
thingy<00:04:11.560> which<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.430> think<00:04:12.940> for<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.209> show<00:04:13.510> the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
thingy which I think for this show the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.030 
thingy which I think for this show the
rumble<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.110> appropriate<00:04:14.560> because<00:04:14.680> there's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
rumble is appropriate because there's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.610 
rumble is appropriate because there's
only<00:04:15.190> four<00:04:15.579> matches<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:16.989> they<00:04:17.079> cover<00:04:17.560> all

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
only four matches so and they cover all

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.199 
only four matches so and they cover all
four<00:04:18.099> matches<00:04:18.250> in<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.580> little<00:04:18.789> description

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
four matches in this little description

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.310 
four matches in this little description
thing<00:04:19.419> right<00:04:19.599> here<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:19.900> I'm<00:04:19.989> think<00:04:20.140> it's<00:04:20.229> that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
thing right here so I'm think it's that

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.030 
thing right here so I'm think it's that
big<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.560> deal<00:04:20.709> that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
big of a deal that

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.010 
big of a deal that
put<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.280> match<00:04:21.490> listing<00:04:21.970> but<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.570> don't<00:04:22.810> know<00:04:22.900> it

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
put a match listing but I don't know it

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.360 
put a match listing but I don't know it
just<00:04:23.050> looks<00:04:23.320> better<00:04:23.470> at<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.800> match<00:04:23.980> listing

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
just looks better at the match listing

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.800 
just looks better at the match listing
because<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:25.210> know<00:04:25.300> how<00:04:25.360> long<00:04:25.510> just<00:04:25.540> looks

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
because you know how long just looks

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.960 
because you know how long just looks
better<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.110> my<00:04:26.170> opinion<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:27.310> if<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.550> can<00:04:27.670> get<00:04:27.820> my

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
better in my opinion but if I can get my

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.360 
better in my opinion but if I can get my
shadow<00:04:28.270> out<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.840> way<00:04:29.020> I'd<00:04:29.200> be<00:04:29.320> nice<00:04:29.620> there
