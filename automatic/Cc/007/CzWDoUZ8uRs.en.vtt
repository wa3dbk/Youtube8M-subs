we<00:00:01.890> got<00:00:02.129> Kristin<00:00:02.820> 17<00:00:03.770> deforestation

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
we got Kristin 17 deforestation

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.680 
we got Kristin 17 deforestation
increases<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.670> greenhouse<00:00:05.850> effect<00:00:06.029> on<00:00:06.569> earth

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
increases the greenhouse effect on earth

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.419 
increases the greenhouse effect on earth
because<00:00:07.080> deforestation<00:00:07.710> causes<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
because deforestation causes the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.820 
because deforestation causes the
atmosphere<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.059> contain<00:00:09.480> all<00:00:10.320> right<00:00:10.530> well

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
atmosphere to contain all right well

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.100 
atmosphere to contain all right well
trees<00:00:11.580> they're<00:00:12.150> made<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.420> carbon<00:00:12.540> they're

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
trees they're made of carbon they're

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.629 
trees they're made of carbon they're
embodied<00:00:13.530> carbon<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:14.009> earth<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.400> when<00:00:14.519> they

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
embodied carbon on earth and when they

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
embodied carbon on earth and when they
biodegrade<00:00:15.089> they<00:00:15.299> release<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.719> carbon<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
biodegrade they release that carbon and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
biodegrade they release that carbon and
we<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> carbon<00:00:17.609> dioxide<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
we know the carbon dioxide is a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.960 
we know the carbon dioxide is a
greenhouse<00:00:19.080> gas<00:00:19.470> directly<00:00:20.310> associated<00:00:20.850> with

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
greenhouse gas directly associated with

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.480 
greenhouse gas directly associated with
the<00:00:21.109> greenhouse<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.260> fact<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.070> more<00:00:23.279> kind

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the greenhouse in fact so the more kind

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.710 
the greenhouse in fact so the more kind
of<00:00:23.609> carbon<00:00:24.029> dioxide<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> atmosphere

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.170 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
would<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.039> problem<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
would be the problem with it is it that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.839 
would be the problem with it is it that
if<00:00:27.300> yes<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.720> does<00:00:27.930> absorb<00:00:28.439> infrared<00:00:29.039> radiation

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
if yes it does absorb infrared radiation

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.270 
if yes it does absorb infrared radiation
so<00:00:30.539> here's<00:00:30.779> an<00:00:30.990> answer<00:00:31.080> from<00:00:31.500> 17<00:00:33.110> okay<00:00:34.280> right

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
so here's an answer from 17 okay right

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
so here's an answer from 17 okay right
into<00:00:36.000> efforts<00:00:36.510> between<00:00:36.750> depth<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.380> 50<00:00:37.739> 200

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
into efforts between depth of 50 200

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580 
into efforts between depth of 50 200
kilometers<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> 60<00:00:39.149> 300<00:00:39.600> kilometers<00:00:39.989> it's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
kilometers and 60 300 kilometers it's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
kilometers and 60 300 kilometers it's
inferred<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.309> composed<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.629> got

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
inferred to be composed up so we got

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.240 
inferred to be composed up so we got
these<00:00:42.989> depths<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.860> want<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.129> what

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
these depths and we want to know what

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
these depths and we want to know what
it's<00:00:44.370> made<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> Earth's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it's made out of there so the Earth's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's made out of there so the Earth's
interior<00:00:46.649> diagram<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:48.090> page<00:00:50.210> 10<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
interior diagram is on page 10 here the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
interior diagram is on page 10 here the
reference<00:00:51.750> table<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.410> we've<00:00:53.340> been<00:00:53.489> given<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
reference table and we've been given a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.439 
reference table and we've been given a
depth<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.329> 50<00:00:54.719> 200<00:00:55.039> 260<00:00:56.039> 300<00:00:56.640> kilometers<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
depth of 50 200 260 300 kilometers so

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
depth of 50 200 260 300 kilometers so
you<00:00:58.109> come<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.500> would<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you come down that would be in this

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
you come down that would be in this
general<00:01:00.239> region<00:01:00.329> from<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> depth<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.590> we're

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
general region from the depth so we're

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
general region from the depth so we're
going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> keep<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.090> dotted<00:01:03.600> line<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
going to keep this dotted line which is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
going to keep this dotted line which is
approximately<00:01:04.430> 1400<00:01:05.430> kilometers<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.909> we're

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
approximately 1400 kilometers so we're

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
approximately 1400 kilometers so we're
going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> keep<00:01:06.780> what's<00:01:07.470> over<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
going to keep what's over on the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
going to keep what's over on the
right-hand<00:01:08.369> side<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.090> boundary<00:01:09.510> as

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
right-hand side of it that boundary as

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
right-hand side of it that boundary as
we<00:01:10.110> come<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> find<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.670> inner

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
we come up and we find that this inner

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
we come up and we find that this inner
core<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.600> made<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> iron<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
core here it's made out of iron and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830 
core here it's made out of iron and
nickel<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.830> therefore<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.240> we're

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
nickel and therefore we know what we're

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.120 
nickel and therefore we know what we're
looking<00:01:15.930> for

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.090 

all<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.509> we're<00:01:24.509> nineteen<00:01:24.900> two<00:01:25.439> processes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
all right we're nineteen two processes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
all right we're nineteen two processes
that<00:01:26.250> lead<00:01:26.369> directly<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> formation<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that lead directly to the formation of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.350 
that lead directly to the formation of
both<00:01:27.840> breccia<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.590> conglomerate<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.360> some

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
both breccia and conglomerate and some

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
both breccia and conglomerate and some
of<00:01:30.509> us<00:01:30.659> through<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.409> experience<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> rocks

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of us through our experience the rocks

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.420 
of us through our experience the rocks
already<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:34.259> breaking<00:01:35.070> cone

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
already know and that breaking cone

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.819 
already know and that breaking cone
climber<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:36.090> both<00:01:36.360> sedimentary<00:01:37.140> rocks<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
climber are both sedimentary rocks and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
climber are both sedimentary rocks and
here<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.610> find<00:01:38.759> them<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> scheme<00:01:39.390> for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
here we find them in the scheme for

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.289 
here we find them in the scheme for
sedimentary<00:01:40.200> identification<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.150> they

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
sedimentary identification and here they

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.109 
sedimentary identification and here they
are<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.890> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
are so if you don't know that then you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.730 
are so if you don't know that then you
know<00:01:45.630> you'll<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> search<00:01:46.350> through<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
know you'll have to search through the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
know you'll have to search through the
rocks<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.430> you'll<00:01:47.610> find<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
rocks and you'll find them here in the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.100 
rocks and you'll find them here in the
sedimentary<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.450> again<00:01:52.049> if

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
sedimentary one and now if you again if

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.370 
sedimentary one and now if you again if
you<00:01:52.290> remember<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:53.180> sedimentary<00:01:54.180> rocks<00:01:54.450> well

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you remember that sedimentary rocks well

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
you remember that sedimentary rocks well
you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> process<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> forming<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you know the process of forming is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.280

and it's got to be one of these ones and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.220 
and it's got to be one of these ones and
when<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:17.220> look<00:03:17.400> at<00:03:17.549> our<00:03:17.959> answer<00:03:18.959> choices

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
when we look at our answer choices

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.970 
when we look at our answer choices
available<00:03:23.090> extrusive<00:03:24.090> would<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.690> be<00:03:24.780> a

not be able to be used all right great

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.170 
not be able to be used all right great
so<00:03:40.380> let's<00:03:40.560> see<00:03:41.209> that's<00:03:42.209> quite<00:03:42.570> okay<00:03:46.609> now<00:03:47.609> we

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
so let's see that's quite okay now we

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.319 
so let's see that's quite okay now we
got<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.359> silicate<00:03:48.900> mineral<00:03:50.000> silicate<00:03:51.000> minerals

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
got a silicate mineral silicate minerals

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.880 
got a silicate mineral silicate minerals
contain<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.750> element<00:03:52.079> silicon<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.769> oxygen

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
contain the element silicon and oxygen

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.520 
contain the element silicon and oxygen
which<00:03:53.609> list<00:03:54.420> contains<00:03:54.750> only<00:03:54.989> silicate

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
which list contains only silicate

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.460 
which list contains only silicate
minerals<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.070> we've<00:03:56.220> got<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> list<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:57.470> basic

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
minerals so we've got a list of basic

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.280 
minerals so we've got a list of basic
minerals<00:03:58.950> here<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.420> we<00:04:00.420> know<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.630> go<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:00.989> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
minerals here so we know to go to the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.170 
minerals here so we know to go to the
last<00:04:01.560> page<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.070> reference<00:04:02.489> table<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.090> the

last page in the reference table to the
mineral<00:04:03.510> Chart<00:04:04.280> 16<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:07.170> we've<00:04:07.320> got<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
mineral Chart 16 and so we've got the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.229 
mineral Chart 16 and so we've got the
composition<00:04:07.859> of<00:04:08.489> these<00:04:08.609> minerals<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.090> we're

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
composition of these minerals and we're

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.020 
composition of these minerals and we're
looking<00:04:09.450> for<00:04:09.600> silicon<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.019> oxygen<00:04:10.850> if<00:04:11.850> you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
looking for silicon and oxygen if you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.090 
looking for silicon and oxygen if you
remember<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:12.600> si<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.200> oh<00:04:13.290> that's<00:04:13.590> great<00:04:13.859> if

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
remember it's si and oh that's great if

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.550 
remember it's si and oh that's great if
not<00:04:14.130> down<00:04:14.700> here<00:04:14.730> we<00:04:15.480> can<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.049> got<00:04:16.140> si

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
not down here we can see that we got si

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.979 
not down here we can see that we got si
and<00:04:16.890> O<00:04:17.160> down<00:04:18.150> at<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.329> bottom<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.870> we're<00:04:18.959> going

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
and O down at the bottom and we're going

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.589 
and O down at the bottom and we're going
to<00:04:19.140> be<00:04:19.200> looking<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:21.150> know<00:04:21.209> minerals

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
to be looking for it you know minerals

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.659 
to be looking for it you know minerals
that<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.409> verses<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.400> don't

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
that have that and verses that don't

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.810 
that have that and verses that don't
have<00:04:23.909> it<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.800> we<00:04:25.800> want<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.280> pick

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
have it in it and we want to pick

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.010 
have it in it and we want to pick
between<00:04:27.570> all<00:04:27.810> these<00:04:28.650> let's<00:04:29.430> see<00:04:29.900> we<00:04:30.900> got

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
between all these let's see we got

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.970 
between all these let's see we got
graphite<00:04:32.510> only<00:04:33.510> silk<00:04:33.780> kimonos<00:04:34.260> well<00:04:34.740> we<00:04:34.860> know

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
graphite only silk kimonos well we know

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.620 
graphite only silk kimonos well we know
graphite<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.550> composed<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.970> carbon<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.450> only

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
graphite is composed of carbon the only

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.660 
graphite is composed of carbon the only
difference<00:04:36.960> between<00:04:37.160> graphite<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.460> diamond

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
difference between graphite and diamond

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.360 
difference between graphite and diamond
is<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.600> way<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.200> was<00:04:40.290> formed<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:41.250> we

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
is the way that it was formed and so we

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.400 
is the way that it was formed and so we
know<00:04:41.490> graphite<00:04:41.970> itself<00:04:42.330> isn't<00:04:42.540> silicates<00:04:43.260> so

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
know graphite itself isn't silicates so

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.200 
know graphite itself isn't silicates so
we<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.650> rule<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:43.860> out<00:04:44.010> right<00:04:44.250> away<00:04:44.370> we<00:04:45.090> do

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
we can rule that out right away we do

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.810 
we can rule that out right away we do
know<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.420> coordinates<00:04:46.080> quartz<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.920> pure<00:04:47.250> you

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
know the coordinates quartz is pure you

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.150 
know the coordinates quartz is pure you
suck<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.240> an<00:04:48.360> oxygen<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.110> so<00:04:49.680> maybe<00:04:49.860> we<00:04:50.040> could

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
suck in an oxygen and so maybe we could

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.130 
suck in an oxygen and so maybe we could
check<00:04:50.370> out<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.670> court<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.330> other<00:04:51.360> potassium

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
check out the court the other potassium

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.620 
check out the court the other potassium
feldspar<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.190> affable<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.790> see<00:04:53.970> what<00:04:54.420> they

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
feldspar and affable and see what they

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.880 
feldspar and affable and see what they
have<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:54.930> them<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:57.200> plagioclase<00:04:58.200> feldspar<00:04:58.230> has

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
have in them so plagioclase feldspar has

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.700 
have in them so plagioclase feldspar has
s<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.340> know<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.760> is<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.000> so<00:05:00.180> good<00:05:00.710> potassium

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
s I know it is the so good potassium

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.430 
s I know it is the so good potassium
feldspar<00:05:02.160> has<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.670> sign<00:05:02.910> hard<00:05:03.150> as<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> circuit<00:05:03.840> so

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
feldspar has a sign hard as a circuit so

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.050 
feldspar has a sign hard as a circuit so
both<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.100> feldspars<00:05:05.580> are<00:05:05.760> actually

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
both the feldspars are actually

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.510 
both the feldspars are actually
silicates<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:07.350> is<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.680> answerable<00:05:08.190> here

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
silicates and so is the answerable here

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.870 
silicates and so is the answerable here
at<00:05:08.730> si<00:05:09.480> you<00:05:09.540> know<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:10.080> those<00:05:10.880> different

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
at si you know in those different

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.080 
at si you know in those different
compositions<00:05:12.630> so<00:05:13.080> we<00:05:13.230> know<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.410> all<00:05:13.890> of

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
compositions so we know that all of

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.310 
compositions so we know that all of
these<00:05:15.740> certainly<00:05:16.740> are<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.780> don't<00:05:18.780> double

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
these certainly are and don't double

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.250 
these certainly are and don't double

drainage patterns which factors

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.040 
drainage patterns which factors
primarily<00:05:38.910> responsible<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.510> causing<00:05:39.750> these

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
primarily responsible for causing these

three<00:05:40.440> different<00:05:40.650> drainage<00:05:41.160> Pat<00:05:41.600> okay<00:05:42.600> well

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
three different drainage Pat okay well

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.180 
three different drainage Pat okay well
you<00:05:42.960> know<00:05:43.050> drainage<00:05:43.440> pattern<00:05:43.860> comes<00:05:44.070> from

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
you know drainage pattern comes from

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.990 
you know drainage pattern comes from
water<00:05:44.400> right<00:05:45.320> drainage<00:05:46.320> water<00:05:46.590> so<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.850> know

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
water right drainage water so you know

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.240 
water right drainage water so you know
generally<00:05:48.840> speaking<00:05:48.870> would<00:05:49.290> have<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:50.070> due

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
generally speaking would have to be due

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.530 
generally speaking would have to be due
to<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.490> way<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.970> water<00:05:51.180> was<00:05:51.360> flowing

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
to the way that the water was flowing

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.280 
to the way that the water was flowing
off<00:05:51.990> of<00:05:52.200> an<00:05:52.320> area<00:05:52.560> correct<00:05:52.860> so<00:05:53.760> I<00:05:54.360> think<00:05:55.110> it's

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
off of an area correct so I think it's

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.670 
off of an area correct so I think it's
going<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:56.240> control<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.660> way<00:05:57.810> that<00:05:57.840> water<00:05:58.530> is

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
going to control the way that water is

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.710 
going to control the way that water is
going<00:05:58.770> to<00:05:58.830> flow<00:05:59.070> out<00:05:59.100> of<00:05:59.430> an<00:05:59.490> area<00:05:59.670> could<00:06:00.510> be

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
going to flow out of an area could be

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.990 
going to flow out of an area could be
many<00:06:01.320> funny<00:06:01.590> things<00:06:01.920> and<00:06:02.600> but<00:06:03.600> primarily<00:06:05.000> the

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
many funny things and but primarily the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.570 
many funny things and but primarily the
structure<00:06:06.480> of<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.660> bedrock<00:06:07.110> is<00:06:07.350> going<00:06:08.040> to<00:06:08.130> you

weathering<00:06:17.790> and<00:06:18.380> over<00:06:19.380> time<00:06:19.640> go<00:06:21.200> back<00:06:22.200> you<00:06:22.350> pad

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
weathering and over time go back you pad

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.980 
weathering and over time go back you pad
fossils<00:06:23.010> were<00:06:23.220> found<00:06:23.580> in<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:24.540> layer<00:06:24.750> of

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
fossils were found in the layer of

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.600 
fossils were found in the layer of
limestone<00:06:25.230> rock<00:06:25.650> in<00:06:26.010> which<00:06:26.250> type<00:06:26.460> of

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
limestone rock in which type of

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.510 
limestone rock in which type of
environment<00:06:27.090> did<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.360> limestone<00:06:27.570> layer<00:06:27.960> form

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
environment did the limestone layer form

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.629 
environment did the limestone layer form
okay<00:06:29.520> brachiopod<00:06:30.060> fossil<00:06:30.720> so<00:06:32.720> limestone<00:06:33.720> rock

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
okay brachiopod fossil so limestone rock

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.429 
okay brachiopod fossil so limestone rock
okay<00:06:35.240> so<00:06:35.599> what<00:06:35.960> we<00:06:36.080> did<00:06:36.949> limestone<00:06:37.460> is<00:06:37.639> a

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:38.439 
okay so what we did limestone is a

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.800 
okay so what we did limestone is a
sedimentary<00:06:39.439> rock<00:06:39.469> and<00:06:40.270> you<00:06:41.270> know<00:06:41.389> it<00:06:41.539> could

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
sedimentary rock and you know it could

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.580 
sedimentary rock and you know it could
form<00:06:42.139> from<00:06:42.710> you<00:06:43.159> know<00:06:43.250> either<00:06:43.550> the

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
form from you know either the

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.649 
form from you know either the
precipitation<00:06:45.590> of<00:06:46.039> seashells<00:06:46.580> or<00:06:46.879> you<00:06:47.539> know

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
precipitation of seashells or you know

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.499 
precipitation of seashells or you know
salt<00:06:48.020> or<00:06:48.639> I'm<00:06:49.639> sorry<00:06:49.879> seashells<00:06:50.330> for

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
salt or I'm sorry seashells for

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.080 
salt or I'm sorry seashells for
limestone<00:06:51.080> or<00:06:51.229> it<00:06:52.189> could<00:06:52.340> also<00:06:52.460> be<00:06:52.610> plant

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
limestone or it could also be plant

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.570 
limestone or it could also be plant
remains<00:06:53.330> yeah<00:06:53.930> so<00:06:54.199> we're<00:06:54.439> not<00:06:54.560> quite<00:06:54.889> sure<00:06:54.949> if

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
remains yeah so we're not quite sure if

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.040 
remains yeah so we're not quite sure if
we're<00:06:55.819> talking<00:06:56.000> which<00:06:56.360> kind<00:06:56.659> of<00:06:56.780> limestone

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
we're talking which kind of limestone

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.959 
we're talking which kind of limestone
we're<00:06:57.409> talking<00:06:57.830> about<00:06:58.009> but<00:06:58.250> if<00:06:58.340> we<00:06:58.430> look<00:06:58.729> up<00:06:58.849> a

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
we're talking about but if we look up a

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:05.290 
we're talking about but if we look up a
brachiopod<00:06:59.509> fossil<00:07:01.330> name<00:07:02.330> on<00:07:02.539> the<00:07:04.300> geologic

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
brachiopod fossil name on the geologic

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.070 
brachiopod fossil name on the geologic
history<00:07:05.449> charts<00:07:06.050> and<00:07:06.289> pits<00:07:06.500> is<00:07:06.800> uh<00:07:07.659> eight<00:07:08.659> nine

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
history charts and pits is uh eight nine

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:24.719 
history charts and pits is uh eight nine
here<00:07:10.779> and<00:07:11.779> um<00:07:12.199> we<00:07:12.860> want<00:07:13.039> brachiopod<00:07:13.610> so<00:07:14.389> oh

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:30.700 

okay<00:07:27.669> bracket<00:07:28.669> pots<00:07:28.909> over<00:07:29.870> here<00:07:30.110> I<00:07:30.139> only<00:07:30.379> see

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
okay bracket pots over here I only see

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.480 
okay bracket pots over here I only see
that<00:07:31.069> we<00:07:31.490> got<00:07:31.729> letters<00:07:32.599> z<00:07:33.289> and<00:07:33.620> y<00:07:34.009> on<00:07:34.430> the

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
that we got letters z and y on the

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.260 
that we got letters z and y on the
brachiopod<00:07:35.379> branch<00:07:36.490> okay<00:07:37.490> so<00:07:37.550> if<00:07:37.819> we<00:07:37.969> look<00:07:38.120> up

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.270 
brachiopod branch okay so if we look up

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.709 
brachiopod branch okay so if we look up
letter<00:07:38.629> Z<00:07:39.169> and<00:07:39.469> Y<00:07:39.710> for<00:07:40.099> what<00:07:40.460> kind<00:07:40.699> of<00:07:40.819> species

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:41.719 
letter Z and Y for what kind of species

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:42.999 
letter Z and Y for what kind of species
seem<00:07:42.169> to<00:07:42.259> be<00:07:42.349> represented<00:07:42.889> by<00:07:42.919> that

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.009 
seem to be represented by that

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:46.089 
seem to be represented by that
represented<00:07:43.879> by<00:07:44.000> them<00:07:44.180> C<00:07:44.779> and<00:07:44.900> why<00:07:45.080> these<00:07:45.740> look

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:46.099 
represented by them C and why these look

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.640 
represented by them C and why these look
like<00:07:46.669> clam<00:07:47.180> shells<00:07:47.599> or<00:07:47.960> something<00:07:48.469> of<00:07:48.620> that

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650 
like clam shells or something of that

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.659 
like clam shells or something of that
nature<00:07:48.800> correct

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:49.669 
nature correct

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.680 
nature correct
so<00:07:51.430> these<00:07:52.430> would<00:07:52.669> have<00:07:52.789> to<00:07:52.879> have<00:07:53.120> lived<00:07:53.330> in<00:07:53.509> it

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:53.690 
so these would have to have lived in it

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.920 
so these would have to have lived in it
in<00:07:53.870> water<00:07:54.560> and<00:07:54.860> when<00:07:55.339> we<00:07:55.460> look<00:07:55.719> closely<00:07:56.719> we've

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930 
in water and when we look closely we've

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.129 
in water and when we look closely we've
got<00:07:57.050> shallow<00:07:57.379> marine<00:07:57.620> well<00:07:57.889> that's<00:07:58.039> water<00:07:58.310> a

00:07:59.129 --> 00:07:59.139 
got shallow marine well that's water a

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.629 
got shallow marine well that's water a
interior<00:08:00.139> grassland<00:08:00.919> it's<00:08:01.069> absolutely<00:08:01.460> not<00:08:01.580> a

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:01.639 
interior grassland it's absolutely not a

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.079 
interior grassland it's absolutely not a
forest<00:08:02.089> absolutely<00:08:02.569> not<00:08:02.690> in<00:08:02.930> a<00:08:03.050> coastal<00:08:03.379> plain

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:04.089 
forest absolutely not in a coastal plain

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:07.029 
forest absolutely not in a coastal plain
you<00:08:05.089> know<00:08:05.210> it's<00:08:05.479> a<00:08:05.810> coastal<00:08:06.529> plain<00:08:06.680> is<00:08:06.800> just<00:08:06.949> a

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 
you know it's a coastal plain is just a

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:09.100 
you know it's a coastal plain is just a
flat<00:08:07.250> area<00:08:07.490> that's<00:08:07.879> near<00:08:08.120> the<00:08:08.389> water<00:08:08.629> whereas

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.110 
flat area that's near the water whereas

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.300 
flat area that's near the water whereas
this<00:08:09.259> is<00:08:09.439> the<00:08:09.560> one<00:08:09.680> that's<00:08:09.830> actually<00:08:09.949> in<00:08:10.189> the

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.310 
this is the one that's actually in the

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.089 
this is the one that's actually in the
water<00:08:10.490> so<00:08:10.729> we<00:08:11.479> got<00:08:11.659> a<00:08:11.689> winner<00:08:11.960> and<00:08:12.139> that's<00:08:12.770> page

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:13.099 
water so we got a winner and that's page

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:15.819
