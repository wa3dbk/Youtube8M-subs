00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 after a very bad 2010 I am 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.980
 still the directors pierre coffin and chris 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.019
 renaud to bring to the big screen the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.240
 terrible and spiteful but now 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
 appeased crane and his army of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 minions with a new must-see 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.560
 adventure this time the protagonist 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.170
 no longer the super-villain who seeks a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.840
 way to seize the moon but a father 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 loving and devoted who converted the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.650
 his laboratory of evil projects in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.199
 a jam factory 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.270
 although with little success when a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.100
 nice day to the league of the anti bad guys 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 in the person of the people luso it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.360
 hires to try to catch a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.730
 dangerous villain who stole a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.760
 powerful serum able to transform 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.800
 anything in a monstrous creature 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.559
 group will be forced to deal with 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 an enemy that comes from the past up 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.390
 this time he is struggling not only with 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 his role as a tender father and also a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.219
 little over protective but with a little 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.739
 larger upheaval ie that of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.400
 to relate to feelings suffered by 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.560
 time and jesi by hilarious jokes from 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.650
 literally make you bend in two by 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.840
 laughter as well as perfect comic timing and a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.509
 the rhythm of the very tight narrative are 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.850
 just the distinctive traits as well as also 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.490
 the preponderant elements of a second 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 unquestionable success if it is true that i 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 cartoons turn out to be 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.909
 perfect when they turn 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.960
 both to the public of children and to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 that of adults 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 very bad me and impeccably a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.810
 jewel from this point of view colors 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.180
 and animation at the limit of the realistic 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.820
 fruit of the last the excellent work of the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.280
 entertainment illumination added up between 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.880
 the other to continuous references to culture 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 pop music and not from the 70s or 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.189
 of the 90s result in a 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.689
 movies where entertainment is at the state 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.130
 sure to sign in moments 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.409
 unquestionably the most amusing there are 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.380
 once again the minions that in this 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.440
 films have earned a space 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.390
 preponderant is the most deserved 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.090
 at the end of the vision of very bad 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.490
 me 2 is just one consideration that yes 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.010
 that is, it can be nice to think that 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.960
 for two hours you can have fun without 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.760
 if and without but 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.760
 serene twists for popcorn from tiffany
