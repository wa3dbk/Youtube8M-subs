00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
will put them in the basis and they'll

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700 
will put them in the basis and they'll
start<00:00:08.639> having<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.210> lot<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.139> questions<00:00:10.559> because

they don't go all the way down this is
the<00:00:13.049> npt<00:00:13.559> threads

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the npt threads

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.810 
the npt threads
these<00:00:14.759> are<00:00:14.910> 3/8<00:00:15.269> NPT<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.920> when<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> start

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
these are 3/8 NPT and when you start

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
these are 3/8 NPT and when you start
them<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.330> most<00:00:18.539> people<00:00:18.840> will<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> they'll

them what most people will do is they'll
get<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> few<00:00:19.859> turns<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.430> them<00:00:20.630> like<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
get a few turns on them like this and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.519 
get a few turns on them like this and
then<00:00:22.670> it'll<00:00:23.670> only<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.720> halfway<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
then it'll only be you know halfway in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.870 
then it'll only be you know halfway in
the<00:00:26.099> thread<00:00:26.430> engagement<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.240> that's<00:00:27.570> correct

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
the thread engagement and that's correct

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.749 
the thread engagement and that's correct
when<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.090> tighten<00:00:30.869> these<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.439> their<00:00:31.920> dog<00:00:32.130> put

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
some sealing tape on the threads when

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.280 
some sealing tape on the threads when
you<00:00:36.030> hand<00:00:36.239> tighten<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you hand tighten it down to where you

two or three turns on the wrench like
that<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> tight

and then the base is ruined you've got
to<00:00:59.280> buy<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> new<00:00:59.520> base<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to buy a new base so you don't want to

and<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.229> turn<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.190> bit

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and they turn this just a little bit

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:19.480 
and they turn this just a little bit
more

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.790 

perfect<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.200> took<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.410> little<00:02:22.500> bit<00:02:22.680> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
perfect so it took a little bit of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.340 
perfect so it took a little bit of
finagling<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> 3/4<00:02:24.960> inch<00:02:25.080> wrench

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
finagling and this is a 3/4 inch wrench

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.450 
finagling and this is a 3/4 inch wrench
on<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.770> side<00:02:27.350> two<00:02:28.350> or<00:02:28.410> three<00:02:28.650> tires<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.220> Snug

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
on this side two or three tires to Snug

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:39.400 
on this side two or three tires to Snug
it<00:02:29.490> up<00:02:36.950> once<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.070> starts<00:02:38.340> getting<00:02:38.580> tight

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
it up once it starts getting tight

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.870 
it up once it starts getting tight
maybe<00:02:40.410> take<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> other<00:02:41.010> half<00:02:41.310> turn<00:02:41.670> or

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
maybe take it to the other half turn or

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.170 
maybe take it to the other half turn or
so<00:02:43.010> there<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.100> go<00:02:44.250> perfect

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
so there you go perfect

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.540 
so there you go perfect

you'll<00:02:52.320> see<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> spring<00:02:52.890> jump<00:02:53.190> then<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.670> just

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you'll see the spring jump then you just

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.330 
you'll see the spring jump then you just
pull<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.150> straight<00:02:54.240> out<00:02:54.890> same<00:02:55.890> thing<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> the

big one turn till the spring jumps pull

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.050 
big one turn till the spring jumps pull
it<00:02:58.530> straight<00:02:58.620> out<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.670> connect<00:02:59.970> your
