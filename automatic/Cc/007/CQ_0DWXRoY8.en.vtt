00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
in this video we're gonna take a look at

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.960 
in this video we're gonna take a look at
PD<00:00:03.780> Aires<00:00:04.049> leather<00:00:04.410> cover<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.520> iPads

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
PD Aires leather cover for the iPads

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.110 
PD Aires leather cover for the iPads
take<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> look<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.720> box<00:00:10.820> here<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.090> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
take a look in the box here we have a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.570 
take a look in the box here we have a
hard<00:00:12.450> plastic<00:00:12.690> covered<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.920> high<00:00:14.519> quality

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hard plastic covered in a high quality

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.109 
hard plastic covered in a high quality
leather<00:00:15.710> if<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:16.859> look<00:00:17.039> closely<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.820> inside

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
leather if we look closely at the inside

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.970 
leather if we look closely at the inside
again<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.660> see<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.050> smooth<00:00:19.380> plastic

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
again we can see it's a smooth plastic

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.980 
again we can see it's a smooth plastic
so<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> leather<00:00:21.570> wraps<00:00:21.840> around

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so we can see the leather wraps around

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.679 
so we can see the leather wraps around
the<00:00:22.230> edge<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.769> appears<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.789> bonded<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the edge and appears to be bonded to the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.689 
the edge and appears to be bonded to the
plastic<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.320> either<00:00:25.470> adhesive<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.580> was

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
plastic with either adhesive or it was

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.410 
plastic with either adhesive or it was
thermal<00:00:27.090> bonded<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.529> some<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
thermal bonded you can see some of that

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
thermal bonded you can see some of that
excess<00:00:30.420> material<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.529> let's<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.009> ahead

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
excess material here so let's go ahead

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.350 
excess material here so let's go ahead
and<00:00:32.309> slide<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> iPad<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:34.969> now<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.030> leather

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and slide the iPad in now the leather

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
and slide the iPad in now the leather
itself<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> high<00:00:37.079> quality<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.770> feel<00:00:37.950> very

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
itself is a high quality does feel very

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.880 
itself is a high quality does feel very
nice<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:39.000> low<00:00:39.210> profile<00:00:39.690> case<00:00:40.020> adds

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
nice it's a very low profile case adds

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.340 
nice it's a very low profile case adds
very<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.370> bulk<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.149> iPad<00:00:42.600> itself<00:00:42.989> if

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
very little bulk to the iPad itself if

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
very little bulk to the iPad itself if
we<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.649> around<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.010> edge<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.149> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
we look around the edge we can see it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990 
we look around the edge we can see it's
completely<00:00:45.480> flushed<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.829> front<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
completely flushed to the front of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
completely flushed to the front of the
iPad<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> doesn't<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.170> provide<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.620> lay

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
iPad so it doesn't really provide a lay

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.760 
iPad so it doesn't really provide a lay
on<00:00:50.100> table<00:00:50.489> design<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> does<00:00:51.960> allow<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
on table design but it does allow you to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
on table design but it does allow you to
use<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.039> screen<00:00:53.489> protector<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> iPad

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
use your screen protector on the iPad

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.119 
use your screen protector on the iPad
without<00:00:54.780> interference<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.829> case

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
without interference from the case

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
without interference from the case
itself<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.910> does<00:00:57.120> leave<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> ports<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
itself it does leave all the ports and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
itself it does leave all the ports and
speakers<00:00:58.440> free<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> volume

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
speakers free so we have the volume

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.680 
speakers free so we have the volume
controls<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.670> we<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.090> lock

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
controls here and we have the lock

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
controls here and we have the lock
switch<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.580> headphone<00:01:05.939> jack

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
switch up here and the headphone jack

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
switch up here and the headphone jack
and<00:01:06.420> microphone<00:01:06.750> jack<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.740> mysteriously

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and microphone jack up here mysteriously

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
and microphone jack up here mysteriously
we<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> cutout<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> SIM

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
we do have a cutout here but the SIM

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
we do have a cutout here but the SIM
card<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
card is actually down here so I'm not

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
card is actually down here so I'm not
sure<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.990> meant<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:14.100> where<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
sure if that was meant to be where the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
sure if that was meant to be where the
SIM<00:01:14.670> card<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.049> place

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
SIM card is or if this is just a place

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
SIM card is or if this is just a place
for<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.799> stick<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.100> finger<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
for you to stick your finger in to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
for you to stick your finger in to
prolong<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> front

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
prolong and when you look from the front

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
prolong and when you look from the front
you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.680> barely<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.640> wraps<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.600> edge

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you can barely see it it wraps the edge

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
you can barely see it it wraps the edge
pretty<00:01:22.170> neatly<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:23.310> holds<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:23.909> very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pretty neatly it holds on there very

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
pretty neatly it holds on there very
snugly<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> doesn't<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.470> don't<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.770> any<00:01:25.920> fear

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
snugly it doesn't I don't have any fear

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
snugly it doesn't I don't have any fear
of<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> falling<00:01:26.850> off<00:01:27.259> over<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.409> very

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
of this falling off over I'm very

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
of this falling off over I'm very
impressed<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> case<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.759> does<00:01:29.939> provide

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
impressed with this case it does provide

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600 
impressed with this case it does provide
protection<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.890> iPad<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
protection for the back of the iPad it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
protection for the back of the iPad it
doesn't<00:01:33.180> provide<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> protection<00:01:33.869> for

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
doesn't provide a lot of protection for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the front of the iPad but certainly am

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.490 
the front of the iPad but certainly am
more<00:01:36.329> concerned<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.780> scratching<00:01:37.200> the

more concerned about scratching the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.280 
more concerned about scratching the
aluminum<00:01:37.950> surface<00:01:38.189> than<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.840> front<00:01:40.110> of
