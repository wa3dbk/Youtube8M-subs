00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.600
 now let's talk about the derivative of the 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.600
 germinative leaf in south africa 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.420
 I have dermo is where the tract is formed 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.160
 gastrointestinal 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.750
 It is the main organic system 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.750
 derivative software 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.880
 here we see its derivatives 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.560
 states determines if he will play in 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.560
 hard surfaces 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.190
 which constitutes the roof of the sack 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190
 vitelino 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.120
 when the disc starts to form 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.300
 millionaire will stand out for that 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.470
 changed amniotic that will form a 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.470
 fold the caudal sepal 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.329
 this is the cfi said 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 and in three hundredths in activity 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.579
 medium 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.579
 but later 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.550
 note well that this one is very wide 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.560
 in this picture we see the medium how it 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:32.280
 long and short 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 informs the interim driver 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.430
 in the fourth week 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.500
 is going to give a connection between the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.800
 amniotic cavity and the bowel that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.800
 Shipping 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.799
 a membrane called the little breaks 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.799
 country 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.369
 for her 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.190
 and the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.640
 and the yolk sac will imagine in the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.640
 amniotic cavity 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.090
 in the seventh week the same thing happens but 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.580
 in the cloacal membrane 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.890
 with membrane 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.340
 is going to form an opening called the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.340
 opening 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.730
 live 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.150
 well here is the growth of 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.150
 orbits 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.489
 who are going to be here 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.180
 deploying laterally of the embryo and 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.859
 is going to be this rounded look 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.859
 also by the weight of the head 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.920
 is going to form the wall of the central 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.750
 embryo 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.220
 except in the conduit you saw the hymn 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.220
 that is still an imagination 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.819
 where this conduit is obliterated ie 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.440
 closes the bowel will adopt a 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.440
 free position in the abdominal cavity 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.250
 today lamont of the umbilical vessels is 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.250
 they will restrict the umbilical ring 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.950
 and the yolk sac will be left alone 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.670
 a vestige from which the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.670
 first hands 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.209
 In the chronic cavity, a 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.690
 arterial lining of the intestine 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.690
 primitive 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.280
 in Lyon area of ​​the plant is the conduit 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.280
 vitelino 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.389
 how can we know the age of an embryo 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:27.129
 Well, you have to count the 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.520
 humitas you have and this would give us the 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.919
 weeks of life that has 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.610
 but these are very difficult to tell 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:39.539
 that's why we use a measure in 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.540
 millimeters from from the apex of the 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:47.160
 head to where the glutes start 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.970
 a few millimeters the vertex of the area 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.970
 approximate with weeks 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.020
 in the fifth week 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.000
 to appear in limb voices 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.830
 this is not an embryo of the crisis 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 week what I want to imply here 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.000
 are the gummies 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.380
 and the upper limbs always leave 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.150
 to develop before the inferior ones 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.680
 begins to develop itself 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.680
 superior in the fourth its half 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.869
 to the totally to the bulge 

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:33.909
 pericardial here will start to grow 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:33.909
 a palette that is going to be our target 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.419
 -sector place the reason for forming the 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.419
 player 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.570
 the lower limbs were to form 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.570
 at the level of lumbar humitas 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:02.020
 here we observe the palette 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.020
 more developed than the empire 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.590
 then they will emerge 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.590
 rays that will form our fingers 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.629
 and you can observe 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.410
 and after giving a second 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.510
 narrowing in which they are going to 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.730
 identify the complete limbs 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.730
 forearm arm hand 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.129
 Thank you
