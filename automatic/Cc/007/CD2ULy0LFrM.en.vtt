00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 So I hope you like that. Bunker # front view from now on 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.059
 I'll explain. 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.750
 The current situation is that we have about 15 yards of fun 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.980
 still 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.600
 Bunkers are very high earthenware, so we are psychologically but most 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.820
 The important thing is 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 Currently the size of 100 wins 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.060
 Oh focused in three noses life corresponding to 75% of the state 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:35.399
 It will be brought to the same size to be symmetrical . 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.600
 The distance we create here is controlled by the amount of sand 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.340
 You will receive 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 So you look at the big circle in detail below 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 At the moment of the actual impact, the club will be placed between the ball and the right border, 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.360
 Impact will be stronger 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.270
 I hope you'll take a look. God does not have a full 100 wins 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.340
 I'd like you to fix your head as much as possible. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:07.470
 * The important thing indeyo view of the current top look at the top left of what we have created 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.060
 When the club shaft 90 around the neck 9 road arms to be parallel to the floor, 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.250
 It is finished. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:18.600
 Now, when you see this, keep your body weight on the left side and look at your head 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.700
 It 's very important that you do not move left and right. 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 When the down-life begins, equally left to the left and enough to the left 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 It's very important to keep the caulking down until the end of August 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 When you go to posture, the first point of bounce is at the back of this decade 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.299
 That's right . 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 Now, what went where and example scripts need to see and observe the phenomena 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.760
 I have. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.220
 Sculpting work 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:52.220
 Club head will pass before May 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.600
 If you look at it before, the head goes through and makes a duck that makes you see this phenomenon. 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 It's coming to me . 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.310
 This phenomenon called floating with the sand without hitting the sound of a bunker shot 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.009
 Please be careful to keep 1 zoom 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.330
 Do not turn both hands of impact t together and stretch out together club 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.130
 Face 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.120
 I will go at right angles to the target and later on 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.010
 So if we come up with an instant assessment and raise our hands early 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.519
 The distance will be reduced, or if you raise your massage, it will be a visual shot. 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.070
 The shoulder is heard , 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.360
 Oh, when you see the overall state currently look to see that these excellent 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.070
 In translation 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.330
 But things often get 100% account also the ordination size of about 80% 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.769
 To take 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.769
 You can say it's 2 o'clock when you put it back with the backswing because it's black.
