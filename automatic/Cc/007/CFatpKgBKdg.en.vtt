00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
another way of doing it they're actually

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
another way of doing it they're actually
the<00:01:10.470> same<00:01:10.500> they're<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.189> call<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.670> go

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the same they're just like call you go

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.590 
the same they're just like call you go
partially<00:01:12.390> outside<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.790> defense<00:01:14.790> um<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
partially outside the defense um you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
partially outside the defense um you
can't<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> normal<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> only

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
can't do it normal way that's the only

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
can't do it normal way that's the only
how<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.439> here's<00:01:19.439> another<00:01:21.290> trick<00:01:22.290> or

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
truck for that and yes you're gonna use

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.310 
truck for that and yes you're gonna use
this<00:01:28.710> ladder<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.250> thingy<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:30.540> climb<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
this ladder like thingy to climb and

this ladder like thingy to climb and
jump<00:01:31.380> over<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> parallel<00:01:33.990> park<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.500> thing<00:01:34.560> on

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
jump over so parallel park this thing on

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.440 
jump over so parallel park this thing on
like<00:01:35.790> right

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
