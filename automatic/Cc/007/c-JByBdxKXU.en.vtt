00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.320
 no 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.670
 well it to him everyone is x 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.320
 shooter I hope you all go 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 super good we find ourselves today 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 on gt5 online for a huge hint 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.950
 on ps3 and xbox 360 that goes all 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 just allow you to shoot at the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.970
 first person with your character 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 so it will be almost the same as on the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.080
 consoles next gen but a little bit 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 different then so for this trick 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.750
 it's really super simple you go 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.000
 simply stick to a corner 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.380
 then you go back after you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 open the wheel disarm and you 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.060
 choose a weapon so no matter 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 which 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.090
 I personally recommend guns 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.350
 assault and the guns you 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 will see really well at first 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 nobody 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.490
 so then you press l2 for 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.540
 aim and you see that age is a 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.190
 beautiful view in first person 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 on my assault rifle so that's 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.330
 really a superb view a heater that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.380
 it's really well done so in fact 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.700
 I will quickly explain 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.770
 how does it happen why yen seen 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.090
 like that in the first person so in 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.220
 does it's the two walls that are just 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.509
 behind you blocking the camera so 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 the camera will be placed just behind 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.170
 your weapon and it will do like a view to the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 first person so frankly I 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 think it's really good 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 redone and super stylish after it's up to you 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.880
 to judge tell me if you like or 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.960
 you do not like in comments 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.549
 and here I am I hope anyway 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.929
 really that this video will have pleased you 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.520
 this is the case as usual was 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.439
 really not leave a maximum of like 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.749
 positive comments and sharing 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.890
 it would make me really happy and 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.600
 I also invite you to come to me 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.020
