00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.170
 I propose you to discover the garden with comparable base q with cinnamon 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.739
 phaneuf performance is age-related 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.029
 so we're going to prepare what's called everyone's moon but who picks up 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.619
 momentum 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.619
 the equivalent of a good glass of milk 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.269
 two others 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.909
 meanwhile begins at the city of the canvas 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 it was a quarter of a glass of sugar with a good grade 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 cooked cinnamon 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 after the fall of m 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 which is good it is not usual 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 we will simply take a new formula 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.080
 not only could I buy 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.920
 and then 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.690
 fry them in a pan 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 of the club 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.830
 here 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.830
 in the pan I will take a good note 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.530
 that's surprising 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.439
 including four others 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.360
 we should do it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.680
 in the yvelines 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 with the back 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 here we go 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 as a ripe sliced ​​brioche no ideas 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.180
 wait and see 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 bowl task 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 It's not worth it 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 cook on each side 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 with the way of life 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.319
 the strange journey 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
 6 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 why do that 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.029
 we can decorate 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.359
 for example with 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.259
 a fresco country in two 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.849
 if I write from your second microwave some meetings we can 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 to be called the same fate of the six other victims 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.259
 added the lybie everyone pulls maple 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.009
 under the projectors 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.899
 well here is another step lost lost briochin 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:47.809
 the relay
