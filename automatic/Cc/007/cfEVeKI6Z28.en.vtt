00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.379
 and I'm very happy to be another video 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.419
 more with all of you day I should do a 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.039
 video case enough time not like that is a 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.590
 makeup tutorial I hope that you 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 like it very much and let's start good what 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 first thing we're going to do for this 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.930
 makeup is that we're going to take a 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.599
 shadow a very light color can be a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.369
 beige and we will apply it as 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.369
 It does all over our eyelid 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.630
 ah 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.630
 ah 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.080
 Y 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080
 to 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.030
 Now let's take a color like 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.700
 violet and we will apply it in the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.150
 logo basin going down a little bit towards 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.150
 lashes 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.500
 now let's take one a little bit more 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 dark and if we're just going to put it 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.550
 in the basin and then 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.049
 Now let's mix these two colors 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 which are very dark purple and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.549
 powerful and we will only put them 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.590
 in the little corner of the eye socket there 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.590
 where the eyelid is divided 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.390
 Y 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.530
 now we take white can be 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.740
 illuminator and we're going to put it in the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.399
 corner of the lacrimal eye above 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.399
 video 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.820
 let's delineate this outline is a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.820
 delineated simple but thick 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.599
 let's take a black pencil and let's 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.599
 delineate inside up and down 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.150
 Y 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.379
 now let's take the part that I believe 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.840
 most important of all the makeups 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.260
 which is the blink to highlight the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.260
 tabs 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.670
 and also do not forget to do it in the part 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.670
 down 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.890
 that's how the makeup ends in the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.989
 eyes now what we are going to do is that 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.239
 Let's fix our face we will 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.310
 apply base if you do not use base 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.310
 liquid the base that we use the apply 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.570
 now we apply corrector we apply 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.720
 some imperfections I apply it in 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.720
 bonfires 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.099
 ah 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.660
 and this also gives more brightness acts 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.660
 as an illuminator 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:23.550
 let's take now blogs we're going to 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.550
 do it in the outline 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.559
 let's drink 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.350
 now let's apply a protector 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.600
 for lips and then what are we going to 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.460
 do is apply concealer on the lips 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.260
 this so that when the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.060
 apply any lipstick or whatever 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.860
 look a lot more powerful we 're going to 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.100
 take a lip liner and let's 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.100
 delineate 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.809
 ah 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.150
 i 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.080
 and now we are going to apply a lipstick that is 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.080
 a little bit darker 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.529
 Y 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.599
