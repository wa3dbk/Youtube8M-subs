00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
some preamp boats which I don't like at

all<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:22.939> like<00:01:23.359> on<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:23.840> one<00:01:24.049> but<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
all I just like on this one but you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.679 
all I just like on this one but you
really<00:01:24.529> just<00:01:24.679> like<00:01:24.889> the<00:01:25.039> valve<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.689> the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
really just like the valve and the

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.289 
really just like the valve and the
neutral<00:01:27.259> all<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.560> other<00:01:27.709> ones<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.429> doesn't

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
neutral all the other ones just doesn't

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.359 
neutral all the other ones just doesn't
stump<00:01:29.929> that<00:01:30.049> kind<00:01:30.499> of<00:01:30.560> sound<00:01:30.770> digital<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.249> be

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
stump that kind of sound digital to be

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.459 
stump that kind of sound digital to be
honest<00:01:31.639> so<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.329> has<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> little<00:01:32.840> glowing<00:01:33.049> tube

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
honest so it has a little glowing tube

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.109 
honest so it has a little glowing tube
inside<00:01:33.829> there<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:34.429> don't<00:01:34.909> know<00:01:34.999> if<00:01:35.060> you

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
inside there I don't know if you

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.929 
inside there I don't know if you
probably<00:01:35.450> not<00:01:35.719> see<00:01:35.929> that<00:01:36.459> but<00:01:37.459> in<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:37.700> case

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
probably not see that but in this case

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.580 
probably not see that but in this case
what<00:01:38.209> I've<00:01:38.329> done<00:01:38.599> is<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.929> try<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.289> give<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.439> an

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
what I've done is to try and give you an

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.190 
what I've done is to try and give you an
idea<00:01:39.709> of<00:01:39.889> what<00:01:40.099> this<00:01:40.219> guy<00:01:40.399> sounds<00:01:40.849> like<00:01:41.029> is<00:01:41.299> I

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
idea of what this guy sounds like is I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.499 
idea of what this guy sounds like is I
have<00:01:42.619> got<00:01:42.950> two<00:01:43.490> behringer<00:01:44.329> C<00:01:45.169> 2's<00:01:45.469> going<00:01:45.919> here

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
have got two behringer C 2's going here

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.099 
have got two behringer C 2's going here
they<00:01:47.509> are<00:01:47.569> pointing<00:01:48.169> at<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:49.959> they<00:01:50.959> are

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
they are pointing at the they are

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.419 
they are pointing at the they are
pointing<00:01:51.649> at<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.609> same<00:01:52.909> level<00:01:53.889> at<00:01:54.889> the

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
pointing at the same level at the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.050 
pointing at the same level at the
speaker

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
speaker

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.629 
speaker
and<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.959> same<00:01:57.109> kind<00:01:57.319> of<00:01:57.439> position<00:01:57.609> so<00:01:58.609> that

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
and the same kind of position so that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.339 
and the same kind of position so that
they<00:01:58.880> get<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.209> same<00:01:59.419> sound<00:01:59.659> a<00:01:59.810> kind<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.139> volume

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
they get the same sound a kind of volume

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.819 
they get the same sound a kind of volume
from<00:02:00.889> from<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.700> speaker<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:03.079> one<00:02:03.349> goes

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
from from the speaker the one goes

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.779 
from from the speaker the one goes
through<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.060> preamp<00:02:05.509> into<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.560> laces<00:02:07.099> and

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
through the preamp into the laces and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.690 
through the preamp into the laces and
the<00:02:08.599> other<00:02:08.780> one<00:02:08.989> goes<00:02:09.259> straight<00:02:09.560> through<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
the other one goes straight through the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.350 
the other one goes straight through the
into<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> laces<00:02:12.610> audio<00:02:13.610> interface<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
into the laces audio interface so the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.300 
into the laces audio interface so the
one

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
one

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.520 
one
bypasses<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.060> vacuum<00:02:16.420> tube<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:16.780> one<00:02:17.020> doesn't

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
bypasses the vacuum tube and one doesn't

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.729 
bypasses the vacuum tube and one doesn't
now<00:02:18.130> I've<00:02:18.340> set<00:02:18.610> both<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> levels<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.349> that

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
now I've set both of the levels so that

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.080 
now I've set both of the levels so that
they<00:02:21.040> are<00:02:21.130> pretty<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.760> same<00:02:21.790> idea

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
they are pretty much the same idea

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:33.589 
they are pretty much the same idea
the<00:02:25.090> levels<00:02:25.480> are<00:02:25.599> showing<00:02:26.520> I'm<00:02:27.520> near<00:02:27.849> enough

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.040 

so<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.870> only<00:02:35.019> thing<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.440> will<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
so the only thing I will do and the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.740 
so the only thing I will do and the
post-processing<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:40.230> will<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:42.750> get

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
post-processing of this will be to get

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.180 
post-processing of this will be to get
the<00:02:43.900> levels<00:02:44.200> exactly<00:02:44.620> right<00:02:44.800> but<00:02:45.040> I'm<00:02:45.160> not

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the levels exactly right but I'm not

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.309 
the levels exactly right but I'm not
going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.580> any<00:02:45.730> cues<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> then<00:02:46.930> we<00:02:47.019> can<00:02:47.200> go

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
going to do any cues and then we can go

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.809 
going to do any cues and then we can go
switch<00:02:47.650> between<00:02:47.830> left<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.700> whole

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
switch between left and right the whole

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
is not the best preempt under the Sun

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.330 
is not the best preempt under the Sun
but<00:03:04.269> at<00:03:04.810> least<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.230> hope<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.769> get<00:03:05.920> an<00:03:06.040> idea

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
but at least I hope you can get an idea

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.580 
but at least I hope you can get an idea
of<00:03:06.610> what<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.330> mic<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.870> hundreds<00:03:08.200> will<00:03:08.349> sound

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
of what the mic to hundreds will sound

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.570 
of what the mic to hundreds will sound
like<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:09.040> preamp

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
like that's a preamp

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.000 
like that's a preamp
it's<00:03:09.790> about<00:03:10.000> preamp<00:03:10.510> now<00:03:10.860> considering<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
it's about preamp now considering the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.600 
it's about preamp now considering the
price<00:03:12.299> 140<00:03:13.299> pounds<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.739> definitely<00:03:15.310> isn't<00:03:15.459> an

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
price 140 pounds it definitely isn't an

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.259 
price 140 pounds it definitely isn't an
expensive<00:03:16.150> thing<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:18.069> I<00:03:18.489> wouldn't<00:03:19.180> be

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
expensive thing so I wouldn't be

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.270 
expensive thing so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:19.600> if<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.049> buy<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> few<00:03:20.620> for

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
surprised if you can buy a few for

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.979 
surprised if you can buy a few for
different<00:03:21.609> purposes<00:03:22.060> here<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.420> there<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
different purposes here and there it's a

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.280 
different purposes here and there it's a
great<00:03:23.320> little<00:03:23.500> mic<00:03:23.890> pre<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.730> really<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.290> nice

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
great little mic pre it really is nice

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.349 
great little mic pre it really is nice
little<00:03:26.700> warmer<00:03:27.700> off<00:03:27.850> sound<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.579> is<00:03:31.090> quite

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
little warmer off sound and it is quite

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.870 
little warmer off sound and it is quite
noise<00:03:31.810> free<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.310> push<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.700> quite

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
noise free this is you can push it quite

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.809 
noise free this is you can push it quite
hard<00:03:34.060> before<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> bit<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.049> noise<00:03:35.819> so

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
hard before you get a bit of noise so

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.130 
hard before you get a bit of noise so
this<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> clean<00:03:37.450> sound<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.959> guitar

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
this is the clean sound on the guitar

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.559 
this is the clean sound on the guitar
I'd<00:03:41.140> say<00:03:41.470> both<00:03:41.819> boats<00:03:42.819> are<00:03:43.060> pointing<00:03:43.359> at<00:03:43.480> it

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
I'd say both boats are pointing at it

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.530 
I'd say both boats are pointing at it
pretty<00:03:44.350> much<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.769> same<00:03:45.010> part<00:03:45.819> of<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.209> speaker

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
pretty much the same part of the speaker

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.809 
pretty much the same part of the speaker
just<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:46.989> different<00:03:47.350> locations<00:03:47.829> but<00:03:47.920> yeah

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
just in different locations but yeah

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.759 
just in different locations but yeah
from<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.389> from<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.019> comb<00:03:50.230> point<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.650> view

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
from the from the comb point of view

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.860 
from the from the comb point of view
pretty<00:03:51.190> much<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:52.120> same<00:03:52.769> part<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:53.950> speaker

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
pretty much the same part of the speaker

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.660 
pretty much the same part of the speaker
and<00:03:55.870> they<00:03:56.049> are<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.230> same<00:03:56.410> distance<00:03:56.829> they're

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and they are the same distance they're

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.750 
and they are the same distance they're
set<00:03:57.910> up<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.090> be<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.450> same<00:03:58.980> volume<00:03:59.980> into<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
set up to be the same volume into the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.750 
set up to be the same volume into the
door

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.060 

I<00:04:06.140> really<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:07.320> these<00:04:07.500> teachers<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.040> think

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
I really like these teachers I think

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.590 
I really like these teachers I think
they're<00:04:08.370> very<00:04:08.400> clear<00:04:09.030> they're<00:04:09.300> very<00:04:09.450> good

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
they're very clear they're very good

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.330 
they're very clear they're very good
focusing<00:04:10.140> stuff<00:04:10.410> they're<00:04:10.860> probably<00:04:11.100> not

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
focusing stuff they're probably not

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.510 
focusing stuff they're probably not
ideal<00:04:11.520> for<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.150> electric<00:04:12.570> guitar<00:04:12.870> having

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
ideal for like electric guitar having

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:38.310 
ideal for like electric guitar having
