know<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.899> let's<00:01:46.110> say<00:01:46.259> you're<00:01:46.439> driving

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
know this but let's say you're driving

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.440 
know this but let's say you're driving
and<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.130> blood-alcohol<00:01:47.369> level<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and your blood-alcohol level is the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.010 
and your blood-alcohol level is the
legal<00:01:48.780> limit<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.290> 0.08<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:51.060> still<00:01:51.390> triples

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
legal limit of 0.08 that still triples

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
legal limit of 0.08 that still triples
your<00:01:52.079> chance<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.829> getting<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.490> fatal<00:01:53.850> car

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
your chance of getting into a fatal car

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
your chance of getting into a fatal car
accident<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.899> did<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.860> thought

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
accident I did not know that I thought

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
accident I did not know that I thought
that<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.579> blood-alcohol<00:01:56.820> level<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.540> at

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that if your blood-alcohol level is at

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
that if your blood-alcohol level is at
point<00:01:57.899> O<00:01:58.020> eight<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.649> right<00:01:59.310> like

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
point O eight you're good right like

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.060 
point O eight you're good right like
like<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.350> enough<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.799> drive

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
like you're you're good enough to drive

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.380 
like you're you're good enough to drive
you<00:02:02.520> know<00:02:02.640> what<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> mean<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> thought<00:02:03.180> that's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you know what I mean I thought that's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.289 
you know what I mean I thought that's
why<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.810> decided<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.070> number<00:02:05.310> Liberec

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
why they decided on that number Liberec

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.210 
why they decided on that number Liberec
know<00:02:06.450> they're<00:02:06.810> scientists<00:02:07.439> didn't<00:02:07.770> set<00:02:08.009> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
know they're scientists didn't set this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.919 
know they're scientists didn't set this
blood-alcohol<00:02:08.670> limit<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.720> probably

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
blood-alcohol limit it was probably

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
blood-alcohol limit it was probably
politicians<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.039> whom<00:02:11.129> drink<00:02:11.459> right<00:02:11.879> no

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
politicians some of whom drink right no

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.600 
politicians some of whom drink right no
no<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> totally<00:02:12.690> get<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
no I totally get that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.870 
no I totally get that
I<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:14.600> if<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.620> numbers<00:02:15.950> are<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.670> it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
I just if the numbers are there and it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.490 
I just if the numbers are there and it
still<00:02:17.330> triples<00:02:17.930> your<00:02:18.050> chance<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.440> getting

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
still triples your chance of getting

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.590 
still triples your chance of getting
into<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.890> fatal<00:02:19.310> car<00:02:19.520> accident<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.180> don't<00:02:20.540> know

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
into a fatal car accident I don't know

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.910 
into a fatal car accident I don't know
maybe<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.960> shouldn't<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.650> blood-alcohol

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
maybe you shouldn't have a blood-alcohol

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.530 
maybe you shouldn't have a blood-alcohol
level<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.640> point<00:02:22.820> oh<00:02:22.970> eight<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.270> don't<00:02:23.480> know

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
level of point oh eight I don't know

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.660 
level of point oh eight I don't know
that's<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.810> my<00:02:24.020> take<00:02:24.560> however<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.490> your

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's just my take however if your

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.450 
that's just my take however if your
blood-alcohol<00:02:25.910> level<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.870> at<00:02:27.050> point<00:02:27.380> ten<00:02:27.710> that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
blood-alcohol level is at point ten that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.030 
blood-alcohol level is at point ten that
quadruples<00:02:29.420> your<00:02:29.900> chance<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.470> getting<00:02:30.830> into<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
quadruples your chance of getting into a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.890 
quadruples your chance of getting into a
fatal<00:02:31.220> car<00:02:31.520> accident<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.150> yes<00:02:32.390> you're<00:02:32.570> totally

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
fatal car accident so yes you're totally

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.810 
fatal car accident so yes you're totally
right<00:02:33.110> about<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.380> fact<00:02:33.740> that<00:02:33.950> alcohol<00:02:34.790> is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
right about the fact that alcohol is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.700 
right about the fact that alcohol is
much<00:02:35.180> more<00:02:35.390> dangerous<00:02:35.810> than<00:02:35.930> marijuana<00:02:36.440> when

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
much more dangerous than marijuana when

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.980 
much more dangerous than marijuana when
it<00:02:36.830> comes<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.280> having<00:02:38.270> effects<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.840> while

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
it comes to having effects on you while

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.750 
it comes to having effects on you while
you're<00:02:39.110> driving<00:02:39.560> yeah<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:40.280> should<00:02:40.310> we

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you're driving yeah and we should we

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.990 
you're driving yeah and we should we
should<00:02:40.790> understand<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:42.730> they're<00:02:43.730> not<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
should understand that they're not the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.180 
should understand that they're not the
same<00:02:44.300> when<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.810> are<00:02:44.840> drinking<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.740> start

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
same when you are drinking you can start

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.400 
same when you are drinking you can start
off<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.520> little<00:02:46.640> bit<00:02:47.030> drunk<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:48.020> can<00:02:48.200> get

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
off a little bit drunk and you can get

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.500 
off a little bit drunk and you can get
so<00:02:48.680> obliterated<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.640> can't<00:02:49.820> even<00:02:49.940> stand

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
so obliterated that you can't even stand

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.380 
so obliterated that you can't even stand

difference between the two

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.110 
difference between the two
is<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:57.230> while<00:02:57.500> when<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.160> drink<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.670> lot<00:02:58.820> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
is that while when you drink a lot you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.060 
is that while when you drink a lot you
tend<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.630> overestimate<00:03:00.080> your<00:03:00.560> ability<00:03:01.040> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
fast this is a meta-analysis that was

fast this is a meta-analysis that was
done<00:03:17.900> they<00:03:18.170> looked<00:03:18.380> into<00:03:18.620> numerous<00:03:19.130> studies

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
done they looked into numerous studies

seems completely legit
it's<00:03:24.560> not<00:03:24.709> gonna<00:03:24.830> change<00:03:24.920> anybody's<00:03:25.790> mind

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
it's not gonna change anybody's mind

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.930 
it's not gonna change anybody's mind
who's<00:03:26.180> anti-drug<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.489> one<00:03:28.489> thing<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.880> I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
who's anti-drug but I one thing that I

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.000 
who's anti-drug but I one thing that I
like<00:03:29.150> about<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:29.690> study<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.890> think

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
like about this study is that I think

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.340 
like about this study is that I think
that<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:32.030> reaction<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.170> going<00:03:33.290> to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
that the reaction to this is going to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.050 
that the reaction to this is going to
point<00:03:33.620> out<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.769> very<00:03:33.860> interesting<00:03:34.400> difference

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
point out a very interesting difference

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.550 
point out a very interesting difference
between<00:03:35.450> conservatives<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.110> liberals<00:03:36.320> when

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
between conservatives and liberals when

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.780 
between conservatives and liberals when
it<00:03:36.650> comes<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.980> scientific<00:03:37.489> evidence

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
it comes to scientific evidence

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.270 
it comes to scientific evidence
definitely<00:03:38.450> before<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.019> study<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.530> honestly

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
definitely before this study I honestly

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.710 
definitely before this study I honestly
thought<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.820> pot<00:03:41.000> did<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.420> significantly

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
thought that pot did not significantly

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.050 
thought that pot did not significantly
affect<00:03:42.230> your<00:03:42.530> ability<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.860> drive<00:03:43.100> but<00:03:43.760> I'm<00:03:43.880> now

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
affect your ability to drive but I'm now

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.360 
affect your ability to drive but I'm now
integrating<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.080> due<00:03:45.320> information<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.130> still

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
integrating this due information I still

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.770 
integrating this due information I still
think<00:03:46.730> pot<00:03:46.910> should<00:03:47.030> be<00:03:47.120> legalized<00:03:47.480> although<00:03:47.750> I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
think pot should be legalized although I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.199 
think pot should be legalized although I
don't<00:03:48.019> smoke<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.920> I'm<00:03:49.010> gonna<00:03:49.220> bear<00:03:49.820> in<00:03:50.000> mind

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
don't smoke but I'm gonna bear in mind

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.850 
don't smoke but I'm gonna bear in mind
that<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.840> does<00:03:50.959> affect<00:03:51.140> your<00:03:51.530> ability<00:03:51.620> to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
that it does affect your ability to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.610 
that it does affect your ability to
drive<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:53.150> isn't<00:03:53.390> gonna<00:03:53.510> affect<00:03:53.570> any<00:03:54.019> your

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
opinions because they'll perceive it in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.280 
opinions because they'll perceive it in
a<00:04:10.730> completely<00:04:11.090> different<00:04:11.329> way<00:04:11.600> regardless<00:04:12.110> of

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
a completely different way regardless of

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.770 
a completely different way regardless of
what<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.560> numbers<00:04:12.590> are<00:04:13.150> but<00:04:14.150> when<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:14.540> comes

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
what the numbers are but when it comes

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.199 
what the numbers are but when it comes
to<00:04:15.019> driving<00:04:15.620> while<00:04:15.890> stoned<00:04:16.250> yeah<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.030> think

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
to driving while stoned yeah I think

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.750 
to driving while stoned yeah I think
it's<00:04:17.570> like<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:18.019> no-brainer<00:04:18.890> when<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.340> comes<00:04:19.579> to

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
it's like a no-brainer when it comes to

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.430 
it's like a no-brainer when it comes to
how<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.239> could<00:04:20.419> really<00:04:20.630> affect<00:04:20.720> someone<00:04:21.320> while

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
how it could really affect someone while

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.170 
how it could really affect someone while
they're<00:04:21.560> driving<00:04:21.770> it<00:04:22.010> makes<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.460> completely

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
they're driving it makes you completely

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.909 
they're driving it makes you completely
out<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.599> like<00:04:23.840> you're<00:04:24.260> out<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.650> you

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
out of it like you're out of it you

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:25.700 
out of it like you're out of it you
can't<00:04:25.160> think<00:04:25.430> right

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
can't think right

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.010 
can't think right
you<00:04:25.889> have<00:04:26.009> slow<00:04:26.280> reflexes<00:04:26.639> so<00:04:27.569> it's<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:27.960> a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
you have slow reflexes so it's not a

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.659 
you have slow reflexes so it's not a
good<00:04:28.229> idea<00:04:28.319> to<00:04:28.680> drive<00:04:28.889> while<00:04:29.100> you're<00:04:29.220> stoned

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
good idea to drive while you're stoned

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.120 
good idea to drive while you're stoned
everyone<00:04:30.330> knows<00:04:30.569> that<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.199> question<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.800> how

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
everyone knows that the question is how

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.890 
everyone knows that the question is how
will<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.550> knowledge<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.180> used<00:04:33.479> when<00:04:33.780> it

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
will that knowledge be used when it

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.920 
will that knowledge be used when it
comes<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.229> drug<00:04:34.470> policy<00:04:35.039> my<00:04:35.639> guess<00:04:35.849> is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
comes to drug policy my guess is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.559 
comes to drug policy my guess is
Republicans<00:04:37.490> anti-drug<00:04:38.490> people<00:04:38.849> are<00:04:39.150> still

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
Republicans anti-drug people are still

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.450 
Republicans anti-drug people are still
going<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.780> use<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:40.169> as<00:04:40.349> a<00:04:40.380> way<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.740> keep<00:04:41.340> it

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
going to use it as a way to keep it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.000 
going to use it as a way to keep it
