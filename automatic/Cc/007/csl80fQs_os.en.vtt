00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
my third favorite manga series it was

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.980 
my third favorite manga series it was
cancelled<00:04:44.960> by<00:04:45.080> viz<00:04:45.410> which<00:04:45.770> sucks<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:46.990> because

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
cancelled by viz which sucks but because

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.960 
cancelled by viz which sucks but because
they<00:04:48.110> only<00:04:48.230> had<00:04:48.470> what<00:04:48.830> five<00:04:49.160> more<00:04:49.430> volumes<00:04:49.790> to

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
they only had what five more volumes to

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.440 
they only had what five more volumes to
go<00:04:50.080> there's<00:04:51.080> 19<00:04:51.530> volumes<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.370> they<00:04:53.210> just

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
go there's 19 volumes and they just

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.070 
go there's 19 volumes and they just
stopped<00:04:53.720> at<00:04:53.930> 14<00:04:54.410> because<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.550> popularity

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
stopped at 14 because of the popularity

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.360 
stopped at 14 because of the popularity
but<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.140> think<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:57.620> one<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.920> best<00:04:58.130> series

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
but I think it's one of the best series

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.280 
but I think it's one of the best series
out<00:04:58.760> there

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
out there

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.010 
out there
it's<00:05:00.290> a<00:05:00.380> harem<00:05:00.830> series<00:05:01.280> but<00:05:01.820> it's<00:05:02.090> amazing<00:05:02.750> so

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
it's a harem series but it's amazing so

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.740 
it's a harem series but it's amazing so
I<00:05:03.320> definitely<00:05:03.710> recommend<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:04.850> I<00:05:05.090> will
