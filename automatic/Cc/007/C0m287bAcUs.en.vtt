00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.440
 one-sided mask and we also have the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.610

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.569
 bull types if you look closely let's go 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.440
 to see they have like a circle in the middle 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:07.530
 there they have a circle and I think it looks 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.530
 very good a long texture 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 that more the bed looks very very very stylish 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.540
 medieval one looks very well that bed and for 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.130
 Like the door after doing very 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.820
 medieval in east in this in this texture 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.209
 the box monsters like the creever the 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.220

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.200

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.569
 unchanged none none of the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.989
 monsters all remain the same 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.829
 they are all the same and so nothing 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.540
