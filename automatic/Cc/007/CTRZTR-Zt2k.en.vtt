place<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> skate<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:49.050> her<00:00:49.200> new<00:00:49.440> attitude

towards<00:00:49.980> her<00:00:50.340> skating<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
towards her skating I think that this is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
towards her skating I think that this is
a<00:00:51.390> great<00:00:51.719> place<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.020> her<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> test<00:00:52.649> herself

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
a great place for her to test herself

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
a great place for her to test herself

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and if she can pull off a good

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.910 
and if she can pull off a good
performance<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.020> think<00:00:55.050> she<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.500> win<00:00:55.680> here

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
performance I think she can win here
