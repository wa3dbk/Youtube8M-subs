00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 and here we are 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.049
 before starting to tell you that you are going to 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.789
 have my best streaks to take me out 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.110
 just yesterday that was the day that 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.820
 I started playing good the first day 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.559
 circus games another saying it clear and 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.209
 Well, here you go sometimes my 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.679
 first barca d'alva of the filter looks at 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.150
 here that I did not see the guy through the 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.769
 crystal is what it has not to play for 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.269
 first time to a game and not be 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.160
 accustomed to the textures of the game 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.599
 but good at the end of yesterday's day 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.580
 I end up getting used to the textures 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.349
 of the game all good then before 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.730
 start telling you that this game I have 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.140
 played thanks to a subscriber that 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.330
 put to already have the question and answer 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.010
 daniele have tried to say 4 what you 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.200
 it seems this game and I really said 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.250
 ostias I have not tried butterfield 4 and 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.990
 remember that my brother had it 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.670
 bought then he said I'm going 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.320
 to steal in quotation marks no and I'm going to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.000
 try me here on my playstation and I'm going to 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.560
 upload something to the channel then well 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 I took a big surprise because to me 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.260
 battlefield 3 I did not like almost anything and 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.730
 approved 3 thousand 42 x balls it seems that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.130
 he had a look like he has an antidote 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.570
 magical secret that I loved this 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.000
 game or I liked it very much and in 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 all afternoon playing and good the truth 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.010
 that I have deduced that I like because 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.940
 it's super colorful the game there are some 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.310
 maps that in 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 you are not going to see it because no streak 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.030
 good but there is a map that is a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.710
 kind of mansion in the middle and there is a 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.450
 back of the map and another respawn 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 a lot away at the entrance to the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.440
 mansion and then it is super 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.120
 colorful produces the colorful or 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 leaves are belize but bright green 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.260
 there is a pool in the middle that supervises 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 militants and map and the truth that good 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.230
 that map almost all to all the maps 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.400
 they are super colorful that's what I 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.620
 like shooting games that's why 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
 I say the texture of call of duty cous 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.100
 from infinity ward I do not like it that much 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.680
 mainly because that's why not 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.570
 It has a texture some colors very 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.430
 turned off so to speak the maps do not 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.260
 so it was good to say also that 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.000
 in this debate fill 4 and very people 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.170
 little bit of saying that in the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.940
 first coffees in the first games 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.830
 I was going around running around 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.020
 map all my aunt as in carlos beauty and 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.220
 people found me like me running 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.630
 by the map and they did not find it here there 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.130
 in a corner that will kill me and it's one 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.020
 signal to see action I did not meet almost 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.770
 Nobody guarin tongo thing that I also 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.770
 he liked quite 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.760
 then another thing that I also think that 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.710
 it has been less unusual for me 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.540
 battlefield 3 beans dolphin 4 is that already 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.860
 I used to come from karting coast to 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.510
 the maps a little bit bigger than 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.070
 faced audible to all not thing that has 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.390
 fact that I brought you the custom more 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.680
 quickly goes from the end 4 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.990
 the maps are also quite large 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.459
 this is exactly on this map for 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.110
 comment a little more on this map that is 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.060
 for sniper I tell you from now 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.959
 this is going to be super handsome to say that he has 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.150
 been one of the maps that has most 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.319
 liked mostly in tlc by teams what 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.720
 it's called that a pain for team of 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.640
 all his life and he's super cool because 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.440
 everyone is always above 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.090
 the roofs of the buildings and you can 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.670
 do there is a duel k'ara k'ara k'ara 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.989
 k'ara not because we are miles away from 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.000
 distance at that time no but before 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.260
 is hundreds of meters away and that we are and 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.640
 well we are there duel to duel with the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.020
 sniper from far away and the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.489
 truth is not super super duper 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.959
 nobody is there in a corner 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.910
 as I said before is everyone 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.170
 up there on the roof there giving our 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.970
 Skills skills with the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.590
 sniper and pretty cool the truth 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.670
 then also good to tell you that in 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.430
 this 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.530
 battlefield 4 there are snipers 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.910
 they kill from an uncle except this one that was the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.470
 first sniper made since 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.940
 it was level 1 but there are some that has 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.980
 caught the ground that mother already killed 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.930
 a shot easily there were also tell 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.060
 that there is a kind of game mode in 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.800
 which you can put your own and there's no 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.330
