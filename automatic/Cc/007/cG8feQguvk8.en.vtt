hi<00:00:00.450> guys<00:00:01.939> bought<00:00:02.939> some<00:00:03.240> cheap<00:00:03.950> model

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
hi guys bought some cheap model

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.930 
hi guys bought some cheap model
aeroplane<00:00:05.460> kits<00:00:06.170> last<00:00:07.170> year<00:00:07.740> never<00:00:08.700> actually

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
aeroplane kits last year never actually

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.129 
aeroplane kits last year never actually
got<00:00:09.599> around<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.960> using<00:00:09.990> them<00:00:10.590> properly<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:12.139> I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
got around to using them properly and I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.590 
got around to using them properly and I
was<00:00:14.009> thinking<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:15.890> these<00:00:16.890> pizza<00:00:17.789> trays<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
was thinking about these pizza trays and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.840 
was thinking about these pizza trays and
whether<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.020> could<00:00:19.230> put<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> propeller<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.580> one

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
whether I could put a propeller on one

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.920 
whether I could put a propeller on one
and<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.510> rubberband<00:00:21.990> motor<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.100> make<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.580> fly

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
and a rubberband motor and make it fly

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.230 
and a rubberband motor and make it fly
and<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> occurred<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> me<00:00:25.670> how<00:00:26.670> much<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.090> use

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and it occurred to me how much do I use

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.919 
and it occurred to me how much do I use
the<00:00:27.390> bits<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:29.480> think<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.750> did

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the bits out of this I think I did

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
the bits out of this I think I did
actually<00:00:31.109> make<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.830> these<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually make one of these up and I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.030 
actually make one of these up and I
don't<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.809> flew<00:00:33.989> particularly<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:34.770> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
don't think it flew particularly well it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970 
don't think it flew particularly well it
may<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.309> worked<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:37.530> it'd<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.649> more

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
may have worked but I think it'd be more

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.940 
may have worked but I think it'd be more
fun<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.340> use<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.809> components<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.829> we

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
fun to use the components and see if we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.639 
fun to use the components and see if we
can<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.550> polystyrene<00:00:42.649> Pizza

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
can get one of these polystyrene Pizza

00:00:43.649 --> 00:01:01.750 
can get one of these polystyrene Pizza
trays<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.190> fly<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> that's<00:00:46.170> why<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.350> use<00:00:59.989> okay

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
trays to fly so that's why we use okay

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
trays to fly so that's why we use okay
we<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> assembly<00:01:03.570> instructions<00:01:03.690> for

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
we have the assembly instructions for

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.880 
we have the assembly instructions for
the<00:01:04.530> aeroplane<00:01:05.780> which<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.170> gonna<00:01:07.320> do

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.679 

you<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.159> bits<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> sticky<00:01:11.760> tape<00:01:11.939> which

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you have some bits of sticky tape which

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.240 
you have some bits of sticky tape which
is<00:01:12.720> how<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> aeroplane<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.920> stuck<00:01:14.220> together

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
is how the aeroplane was stuck together

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
is how the aeroplane was stuck together
we've<00:01:17.250> got<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> wings<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> tail<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
we've got the wings and the tail and the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.620 
we've got the wings and the tail and the
fin<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.619> nice<00:01:20.100> thin<00:01:21.290> polystyrene<00:01:23.630> might

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
fin it's all nice thin polystyrene might

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
fin it's all nice thin polystyrene might
have<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> make<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> some<00:01:25.470> time<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.790> we're

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
have to make that some time but we're

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.550 
have to make that some time but we're
not<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> stain<00:01:29.600> all<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:31.020> want

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
not going to stain all I really want

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.780 
not going to stain all I really want
is<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.640> propeller<00:01:34.000> assembly<00:01:38.399> I'm<00:01:39.399> us<00:01:39.579> we'll

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
is the propeller assembly I'm us we'll

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:48.090 
is the propeller assembly I'm us we'll
make<00:01:39.820> use<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.450> stick<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:47.710> some<00:01:47.920> rubber

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
make use of the stick got some rubber

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.969 
make use of the stick got some rubber
bands<00:01:51.539> won't<00:01:52.539> need<00:01:52.780> these<00:01:53.080> bits<00:01:53.439> those<00:01:53.830> are

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
bands won't need these bits those are

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.169 
bands won't need these bits those are
the<00:01:54.039> bits<00:01:54.220> for<00:01:55.200> building<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.320> body<00:01:57.179> no

the bits for building the body no
touching<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.689> wing<00:02:04.740> might<00:02:05.740> use<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.009> bit

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
touching the wing might use that bit

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:21.610 
touching the wing might use that bit
that's<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.819> bit<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:11.850> back<00:02:12.850> end

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.440 

particularly<00:02:22.620> well<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:25.969> so<00:02:26.969> if<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.239> bother

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
particularly well but so if I bother

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.190 
particularly well but so if I bother
with<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> wheels<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:29.599> might<00:02:30.599> add<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.079> I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
with the wheels I might add them if I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.339 
with the wheels I might add them if I
need<00:02:31.379> extra<00:02:31.560> weight<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.219> the<00:02:32.340> front<00:02:33.349> no

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
need extra weight to the front no

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.289 
need extra weight to the front no
intention<00:02:34.859> of<00:02:34.980> trying<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.430> make<00:02:35.609> it<00:02:35.640> rise<00:02:36.030> off

intention of trying to make it rise off
the<00:02:36.510> ground<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.769> should<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:43.980> glue<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.400> on

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the ground so I should just glue it on

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.379 
the ground so I should just glue it on
there<00:02:45.000> good<00:02:46.909> old<00:02:47.909> hot<00:02:48.180> glue<00:02:49.849> put<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.909> thin<00:02:51.239> on

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
there good old hot glue put a thin on

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.129 
there good old hot glue put a thin on
the<00:02:51.540> top<00:02:51.920> cut<00:02:52.920> some<00:02:53.159> ailerons<00:02:53.819> into<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> back

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
the top cut some ailerons into the back

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.289 
the top cut some ailerons into the back
of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.159> tray<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.280> see<00:02:59.669> if<00:02:59.760> we<00:02:59.849> can<00:02:59.970> make<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
of the tray and see if we can make it

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.129 
of the tray and see if we can make it
fly<00:03:03.079> I'm<00:03:04.079> cutting<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.569> center<00:03:06.569> section<00:03:07.019> out

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
fly I'm cutting the center section out

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.649 
fly I'm cutting the center section out
of<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.349> back<00:03:07.849> because<00:03:08.849> on<00:03:09.060> my<00:03:09.269> previous

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
of the back because on my previous

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.409 
of the back because on my previous
planes<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.680> find<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.189> tended<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.939> act<00:03:12.150> as<00:03:12.389> a

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
planes I find that tended to act as a

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.250 
planes I find that tended to act as a
aileron<00:03:14.540> tilting<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.659> plane

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
aileron tilting the plane

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.610 
aileron tilting the plane
the<00:03:16.530> wrong<00:03:16.709> way<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.909> I've<00:03:18.030> cut<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.389> bit<00:03:18.569> out

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
the wrong way so I've cut that bit out

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.429 
the wrong way so I've cut that bit out
the<00:03:19.620> bits<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:19.919> I've<00:03:20.099> left<00:03:20.750> I'll<00:03:21.750> score<00:03:22.409> a

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
the bits that I've left I'll score a

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.369 
the bits that I've left I'll score a
line<00:03:22.739> across<00:03:23.099> them<00:03:23.459> with<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.639> pen<00:03:24.199> so<00:03:25.199> that<00:03:25.229> I

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
line across them with a pen so that I

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:48.390 
line across them with a pen so that I
can<00:03:25.530> bend<00:03:25.739> them<00:03:25.889> up<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.159> down

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.280 

put<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.430> fin<00:03:49.730> on<00:03:49.879> the<00:03:49.910> back<00:03:50.060> cut<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.840> out<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:50.989> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
put a fin on the back cut it out of the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.050 
put a fin on the back cut it out of the
cardboard<00:03:52.040> box<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.910> plane<00:03:53.150> came<00:03:53.480> in

cardboard box that the plane came in

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.430 
cardboard box that the plane came in
I've<00:03:56.060> also<00:03:56.980> folded<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.160> along<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.959> back<00:04:00.110> there

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
I've also folded it along the back there

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.880 
I've also folded it along the back there
so<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.769> can<00:04:01.069> adjust<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.819> if<00:04:01.940> we<00:04:02.090> need<00:04:02.269> some

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
so I can adjust it if we need some

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.600 
so I can adjust it if we need some
directional<00:04:03.890> changes<00:04:05.890> at<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.010> moment<00:04:07.370> it's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
directional changes at the moment it's

take<00:04:28.400> some<00:04:28.610> weights<00:04:28.850> with<00:04:29.150> me<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.570> we'll<00:04:29.780> go

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
take some weights with me and we'll go

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.200 
take some weights with me and we'll go
and<00:04:30.080> give<00:04:30.170> it<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.320> test<00:04:30.530> run<00:04:30.850> right<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.060> is

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210

the garden today but I got sidetracked
this<00:06:08.580> afternoon<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.389> didn't<00:06:10.349> get<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.530> chance

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
this afternoon and didn't get a chance

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.379 
this afternoon and didn't get a chance
to<00:06:10.919> do<00:06:11.039> it<00:06:11.159> while<00:06:11.310> it<00:06:11.460> was<00:06:11.550> still<00:06:11.729> daylight

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
to do it while it was still daylight

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.830 
to do it while it was still daylight
so<00:06:13.169> we're<00:06:14.099> smashing<00:06:14.669> it<00:06:14.789> into<00:06:14.940> things<00:06:15.300> in<00:06:15.599> my

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
so we're smashing it into things in my

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.670 
so we're smashing it into things in my
kitchen<00:06:16.320> instead<00:06:17.060> it<00:06:18.060> shows<00:06:18.270> promise<00:06:18.630> it<00:06:19.289> does

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
kitchen instead it shows promise it does

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.600 
kitchen instead it shows promise it does
just<00:06:20.370> about<00:06:20.960> start<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.169> lift<00:06:22.470> so<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.310> suppose

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
just about start to lift so I suppose

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.180 
just about start to lift so I suppose
you<00:06:23.849> could<00:06:24.000> probably<00:06:24.210> say<00:06:24.509> it's<00:06:24.719> a<00:06:25.190> glider

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
you could probably say it's a glider

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.180 
you could probably say it's a glider
with<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.580> bit<00:06:26.789> of<00:06:26.820> extended<00:06:27.539> distance<00:06:28.039> aided<00:06:29.039> by

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
with a bit of extended distance aided by

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.850 
with a bit of extended distance aided by
the<00:06:29.250> rubber<00:06:29.550> bands<00:06:30.139> one<00:06:31.139> day<00:06:31.320> I'll<00:06:31.469> get<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:31.710> fly

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
the rubber bands one day I'll get to fly

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.230 
the rubber bands one day I'll get to fly
them<00:06:32.070> outside<00:06:33.620> when<00:06:34.620> the<00:06:34.740> weather's<00:06:35.039> right

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
them outside when the weather's right

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.110 
them outside when the weather's right
looks<00:06:36.240> like<00:06:36.330> fun<00:06:36.690> anyway
