00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone with you puzzle is second 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.930
 release of secrets from backstage gears of 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 war and here all the same rules work 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 as in other issues if you learned 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.620
 something new anything that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 Like if you are absolutely all of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.690
 this is already familiar then I expect from you dizlike 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.000
 in the first issue we learned that gears of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.820
 war was originally called anril warfare 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
 but later spun off into a separate series 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.160
 while this all happened the game moved 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.430
 from the engine unreal engine 2 and 5 on dril 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.489
 engine 3 she andrew 125 released at that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.510
 time anril annera 2004 which people 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.120
 were able to find 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.360
 remnants girs of yes that is originally 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 tried to do something like that 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.930
 incomprehensible either anryl apparently either girs and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 it turned out that the gears and steel 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.090
 separate remnants of mention 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.750
 Cooking gunner guns remained in the game 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.760
 This gun was a portable version. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.379
 changan from the gears of war series and how to write 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 on the internet she was very much like 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.930
 changan 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 but only small with her could 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.700
 run and move unlike the way 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 desperate gun on pervosti in the game locust and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.920
 that is, our main enemies were to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.689
 to be called nila bushes and guys to my now 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.320
 nintendo was a game of the same name 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.990
 by name 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.090
 and developers from epic games pokumekat 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.979
 decided that it would be better not to on the right 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 problems there will be a conflict there 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.180
 some kind of graters and called them a monster with 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.220
 gears of our luck mouth 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.770
 translated into Russian, this means 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.360
 locust gears of war game bloody 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 rather cruel for this reason 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.820
 developers have introduced such a function into the game 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.310
 as 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.650
 disabling this very content i.e. 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.930
 bloody you again not sure that someone 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.659
 took advantage of it but even in the ultimate 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
 editions that is right before the version is 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.350
 function migrated and even now in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.579
 new version of xbox one can be disabled 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.130
 meat and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.930
 swears but I still don't understand how 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 you can refuse the blood that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.700
 splatter while sawing locust a 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 by the way if the game was from 1 person it 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.380
 would probably be quite hard 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 then sawing the words smart she 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.880
 plan from 1 person but the creators 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.799
 were horrified to see this sight and understood 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.929
 what to do in the third person first 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.849
 so gears of war will move away from them 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.120
 game series unreal because apparently 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.769
 when they did 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.780
 the first person this game she was damn 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.659
 similar to Henri IV, too, even now there 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.220
 such similarities plus you can end up 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.750
 you can watch his face 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.150
 implement in the game some new chips 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.549
 so they of course decided the third 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.159
 face because at first they all did 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.079
 all all all they have on the ground and that 3 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.280
 completely new such look at games with 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.590
 their points of view 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.379
 However, some chips still did not 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.209
 got into the game and now is quite understandable 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.790
 why for example in the early stages 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.220
 development of headlights was the idea to cram 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.109
 girs and moral meter it is such 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.930
 characteristic which depended on 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.269
 what is happening in the game with the hero because the heroes 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.819
 a lot of meat starts to get nervous well or 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.040
 problems there are starting to draw deep when 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.450
 be disheartened and just sad to end up 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.000
 the plan could reach such that 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.609
 your mate would just perform suites and 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.890
 now of course it sounds funny imagine 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.810
 only you walk with dominica package 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.390
 corridors yes the plot and then you hear for 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.310
 back shot turn around and one of 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.709
 the main characters just killed himself and he 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.420
 dead could not stand his morality meter 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.970
 of course it is now really funny 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.470
 but if they had written it here probably 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.720
 it would be what I like, after all, 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.880
 innovation yes because even now 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.919
 it doesn't often do though there were 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.459
 old games in which something similar 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.530
 happened 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.349
 and if this issue brought you some 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.329
 new infu that like you if everything 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.819
 knew sculpt dizlike boldly 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.430
 on this i have all thanks for watching 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.430
 I hope you were interested happy
