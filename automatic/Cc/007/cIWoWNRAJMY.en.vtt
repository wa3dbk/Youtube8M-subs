00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
just take out my two pads you got two

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.060 
just take out my two pads you got two
guys<00:03:01.390> I'm<00:03:01.600> gonna<00:03:01.690> take<00:03:01.810> my<00:03:02.050> spring<00:03:02.440> put<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.920> in

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
guys I'm gonna take my spring put it in

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.000 
guys I'm gonna take my spring put it in
between<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.820> two<00:03:04.150> pads<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.620> spring

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
between the two pads and this spring

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.900 
between the two pads and this spring
actually<00:03:06.760> has<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.500> hole<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.860> right<00:03:09.070> here<00:03:09.730> and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
actually has a hole in it right here and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.150 
actually has a hole in it right here and
this<00:03:10.120> hole<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.600> going<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.780> line<00:03:11.020> up<00:03:11.050> with<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
this hole is going to line up with the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.540 
this hole is going to line up with the
hole<00:03:12.400> on<00:03:13.260> your<00:03:14.260> brake<00:03:14.800> pads<00:03:15.070> because<00:03:15.340> that's

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
hole on your brake pads because that's

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.040 
hole on your brake pads because that's
the<00:03:15.790> hole<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.150> you're<00:03:16.360> actually<00:03:16.570> pin

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
the hole that you're actually pin

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.350 
the hole that you're actually pin
actually<00:03:18.010> slides<00:03:18.370> through<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.060> slides

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
actually slides through so it slides

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.870 
actually slides through so it slides
through<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.870> spring<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.130> spring<00:03:21.400> can't

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
through your spring so that spring can't

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.360 
through your spring so that spring can't
come<00:03:22.180> out<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.390> get<00:03:22.900> lost<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:24.070> slides

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
come out and get lost and it slides

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.570 
come out and get lost and it slides
through<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:25.120> two<00:03:25.360> disc<00:03:26.140> brake<00:03:26.440> pads<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:27.370> that

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
through the two disc brake pads so that

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.120 
through the two disc brake pads so that
actually<00:03:28.090> keeps<00:03:28.360> them<00:03:28.680> secured<00:03:29.680> in<00:03:29.920> your

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
actually keeps them secured in your

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.090 
actually keeps them secured in your
caliper<00:03:30.640> once<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:31.390> got<00:03:31.540> these<00:03:31.750> together<00:03:32.500> and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
caliper once I got these together and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.270 
caliper once I got these together and
line<00:03:33.549> our<00:03:34.180> spring<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.989> line<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.070> see<00:03:36.220> how

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
line our spring and line you can see how

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.150 
line our spring and line you can see how
that<00:03:36.459> spring<00:03:36.760> disc<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.470> sets<00:03:38.470> inside<00:03:38.830> there

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
that spring disc is sets inside there

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.120 
that spring disc is sets inside there
now<00:03:39.790> I'm<00:03:39.850> going<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.060> take<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.510> put<00:03:41.320> those<00:03:41.799> down

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
now I'm going to take and put those down

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.660 
now I'm going to take and put those down
inside<00:03:42.670> my<00:03:42.850> calipers<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.860> like<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.519> just

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
inside my calipers and I like to just

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.940 
inside my calipers and I like to just
take<00:03:45.880> get<00:03:46.329> him<00:03:46.480> lined<00:03:46.870> up<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.410> I'm<00:03:47.769> going<00:03:47.920> to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
take get him lined up and I'm going to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.100 
take get him lined up and I'm going to
set<00:03:48.130> him<00:03:48.160> down<00:03:48.250> as<00:03:49.000> soon<00:03:49.269> as<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.570> gets<00:03:49.750> inside

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
set him down as soon as it gets inside

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.170 
set him down as soon as it gets inside
the<00:03:50.290> caliper<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.950> start<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.459> spread<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.880> apart

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
the caliper I start to spread it apart

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.110 
the caliper I start to spread it apart
so<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:52.750> actually<00:03:52.989> spread<00:03:53.620> apart<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.430> go<00:03:54.850> on

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
so I actually spread apart and go on

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.250 
so I actually spread apart and go on
both<00:03:55.390> sides<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:57.190> disc<00:03:57.910> brake<00:03:58.150> rotor<00:03:58.510> that

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
both sides of my disc brake rotor that
