 geo and wellbeing I bring you more 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.559
 information about gears of war 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.139
 hotmail 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.689
 Well, we started the first thing the most 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.640
 important is confirmed thanks to rod 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.650
 fergusson of epic games that will have 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.270
 a normal multiplayer like this is for the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.029
 that are worried that it was like a 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.800
 Halo odst type is not confirmed 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.320
 normal multiplayer and new modes of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.050
 game and well there are no details about 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.719
 that but we fully confirm by 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.820
 rocks fergunson and this one I imagine that 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.710
 will continue with the basics that can not be 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 remove as it would be as a team 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.929
 and execution all that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.519
 then the next and all 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.109
 we know through the three 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.379
 courses war a bit of the story about 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.839
 of world and the court but of the others 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.820
 two members of the team kilo on 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.589
 cars a paddock and sofía hendrix no 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.690
 We knew absolutely nothing 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.929
 even his face or what's going on with his life 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 Well, just a little bit since the forum 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.470
 pique I got to know more 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.780
 information I will tell you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 first he is a refugee from the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.320
 mls the union of republics 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 independent for those who do not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.580
 you know is the opposite side flown 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.100
 enemy of the coalition of governments 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 ordered on its axis or by the same says 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.050
 that comes the other side of the wars 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 of the pendulum and well the east says that 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.940
 will give you a new perspective of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.580
 kilo team of one and then the next 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.740
 sofia hendrix Well she's a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.370
 cadet of the guard academy are and if 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.470
 she is this because she is going to graduate 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.119
 the same day as the emergency but 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.490
 it has been canceled and she is something else 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.290
 similar to what would be being minion 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.840
 kim that well you know that it is always 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.619
 willing to follow the orders and then 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.020
 all that roll and then this one is confirmed 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.080
 the place where it's going to happen and your walkman 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
 that place is going to be called when going back to 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.020
 baby is like that with h and it is the house of 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.990
 the academy of the guards are says 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.970
 apparently what he says here is 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.399
 it's like what it would be today 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.739
 a san diego or san francisco in the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.580
 Second World War I do not know how 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.800
 would be that is this a place this 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.860
 a lot of military environment is what is said 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.920
 about safe bay hardware 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.170
 where will it happen and I use world for men and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.150
 then also from the forum of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.470

 with a taxi I'm going to say some 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.650
 example the campus will load a hammer 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.220
 boss and then the well as you know 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.220

 your tip how to use it and all that then 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.209
 a little bit of history about john 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.090
 I'm going to tell you in a way 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.980
 fast your man starts 15 years before 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.510
 to go software 1 this I do not know if it to the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.760
 date is correct since several have 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.879
 corrected correct does not exist anymore was it 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.590
 that I read in the forums of epic games and 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.810
 convert the equipment and the rest of the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.640
 kilo team that are subject to trial 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.420
 against the coalition of governments 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.480
 ordered this as the colonel does 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.150
 blooming at least that's how it seems 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.280
 is the one that tells the story in both 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.200
 trailers that made known of josh 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.599
 howatson men who is one of the leaders 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.579
 of the catch in that time and accused the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.769
 kilo team of cowardice desertion 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.500
 break-in and technology theft 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.989
 experimental military and above all high 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.940
 good tradition we will see what else has been 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.000
 released about the corner 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.860
 blooming later 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.860
 then some information about the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.250
 epic campaign this is still planning 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.530
 the use of kinematics but of course not so 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.019
 long this the truth wants to do 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.930
 short and essential cinematics 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.210
 to not break the intense game and that the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.520
 plot is based on the narration 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.710
 this means that you never leave 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.880
 to stop moving and they are removed 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.410
 all those talks that sometimes get 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.090
 forget boring or sometimes 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.700
 you have to cancel that they speak for 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.610
 radio I do not know yes remember of all so much 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500
 two previous yours and also something 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.360
 important while Thursday all the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.520
 campaign web course where you will have 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.360
 to be very attentive to what happens in your 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.980
 around 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.169
 this with what they did say so 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.669
 they are trying to show a lot of 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.040
 the story through the environment of 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.570
 way that you take the time and look 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.520
 around and seeing what's in your environment 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.320
 You will see stories represented before 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.540
 you are very interesting way person 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.010
 tell the story with that what they say 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.230
 that you do not have to stop moving 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.780
 never 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.970
 and each of the characters are going to be rare 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.980
 your part of the puzzle this sounds 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.870
 interesting perhaps is improved so 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.250
 in the filtered image that we have to go your 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.470
 guardian at a certain time managed 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.770
 to sofía since they say first that 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.270
 you are going to drive 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.099
 see who is the main character 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.440
 then imagine that it will be roll 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.360
 Rolando as the campaign progresses 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.790
 then something very important I do not know if 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.560
 remember that in his hunger bar he saved himself 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.890
 two pandas playing in madness and for the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.560
 act 4 walk about to fight with 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.380
 rahm or with scores because the truth is that 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.810
 yes texture the hand is not already if you have 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.060
 worrying and in day as well as yes that 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.430
 there's good again and that struggling not and 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.830
 that's what you enjoy a game and 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.330
 then this is what they want to go back to 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.820
 wyoming be competition 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.410
 that's what Rod Fergusson said we want to bring 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.690
 back the short to the palms and the 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.400
 natural attention of the game first of all 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.560
 this other crazy thing is inspire you 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.540
 afraid that how they would be and the software or 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.820
 one and well then this looks very 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.980
 interesting and that they promised 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.700
 with guys software 3 but the truth is not 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.670
 fulfilled was very the I do not know something 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:22.050
 there was something missing that made you battle more 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.610
 then this hotmail this is the cumulus already 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.190
 they could see it in the videos is still 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.840
 faster than inhibiting war 3 and then 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.690
 the crazy ones are going to have a greater force 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.340
 lethal here they specified what you do not 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.260
 you are going to want to put 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.419
 outside of your coverage you will not grow 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.060
 your culture to spin the 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.770
 granada and winnow the because before 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.190
 finish the first round you will be 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.110
 dead 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.070
 they specified it in gears of wars 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.410
 jackman 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.780
 and well well almost to finish friends 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.320
 from youtube, we are already going away 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.050
 little bit more one of the great things 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.760
 this is that more information will be given 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.090
 about is the whole story of the 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.440
 software and locust this all this 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.210
 had not known since it is 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.180
 classified and you will see from the other 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.040
 side then then finally friends of 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.740
 youtube something very important about the 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.840
 campaign on the regeneration system 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.220
 smart since the system 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.440
 smart feedback is going to be a 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.420
 artificial intelligence that 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.940
 go repeating if you repeat in the 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.230
 campaign or repeats a certain chapter the 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.320
 same artificial intelligence of the game 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.270
 is going to check how you are playing and 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.280
 adapt to your game so says it since 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.170
 this one is going to change the variety of 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.960
 enemy both in quality both in 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.940
 amount that is consistent repeating or if 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.370
 you play one 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.040
 to one as it is called if you have more 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.660
 skill of the one you put 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.000
 Say you select that skill 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:49.360
 normal difficulty and you're playing on 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.680
 very easy is the same the same 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.630
 artificial intelligence is going to 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.960
 change and it's going to be harder for you 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.580
