stove frigerator and my desk that type

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.310 
stove frigerator and my desk that type
of<00:03:37.250> thing<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.640> Bentley<00:03:38.450> over<00:03:38.510> here<00:03:38.930> he's<00:03:39.110> just

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
of thing and Bentley over here he's just

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.660 
of thing and Bentley over here he's just
he's<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:40.040> chilling<00:03:40.730> out<00:03:40.850> hanging<00:03:41.390> out<00:03:41.510> here

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
he's just chilling out hanging out here

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.190 
he's just chilling out hanging out here
but<00:03:43.670> anyway<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:44.360> looks<00:03:44.540> nice<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.019> like

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
but anyway it really looks nice I like

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.350 
but anyway it really looks nice I like
it<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.680> far<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:46.250> turned<00:03:46.519> out<00:03:46.730> alright<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.269> was

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
it so far it turned out alright it was

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.479 
it so far it turned out alright it was
hard<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.630> do<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.930> ribs<00:03:48.140> cap<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:49.220> steel

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
hard to do the ribs cap and the steel

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.680 
hard to do the ribs cap and the steel
because<00:03:49.730> they'd<00:03:49.940> have<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.150> picking<00:03:50.390> up<00:03:50.450> ladder

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
because they'd have a picking up ladder

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.600 
because they'd have a picking up ladder
so<00:03:51.049> there<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.410> few<00:03:51.830> little<00:03:51.980> riffles<00:03:52.459> in

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
so there is a few little riffles in

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.120
