00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
really cool smooth transition so you

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.010 
really cool smooth transition so you
definitely<00:04:31.470> should<00:04:32.280> look<00:04:32.400> at<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.900> if<00:04:33.900> you

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
definitely should look at that if you

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.670 
definitely should look at that if you
want<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.229> include<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.560> dock<00:04:34.800> show<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:36.680> HUD

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
have icon settings um the amount of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.460 
have icon settings um the amount of
bounciness<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:44.099> has<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.520> apps<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:45.599> density

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
bounciness it has the apps the density

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.430 
bounciness it has the apps the density
or<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:47.070> friction<00:04:47.690> if<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:49.140> don't<00:04:49.289> know<00:04:49.380> what

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
or the friction if you don't know what

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.380 
or the friction if you don't know what
that<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.650> go<00:04:49.979> look<00:04:50.190> up<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.520> dictionary<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
that is go look up in the dictionary and

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.710 
that is go look up in the dictionary and
then<00:04:52.289> also<00:04:52.500> finger<00:04:53.039> mode<00:04:53.219> I<00:04:53.250> don't

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
then also finger mode I don't

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.770 
then also finger mode I don't
I<00:04:53.780> have<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.140> but<00:04:54.380> it's<00:04:54.530> pretty<00:04:54.770> cool<00:04:55.660> ok<00:04:56.660> I'm

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
I have this but it's pretty cool ok I'm

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.700 
I have this but it's pretty cool ok I'm
going<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:56.990> shake<00:04:57.230> right<00:04:57.410> here<00:04:57.760> just<00:04:58.760> shake

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
going to shake right here just shake

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.410 
going to shake right here just shake
then<00:05:00.710> if<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.980> just<00:05:01.250> hold<00:05:01.550> right<00:05:01.850> here<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.210> all

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
then if I just hold right here to all

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.930 
then if I just hold right here to all
come<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.990> my<00:05:03.140> finger<00:05:03.590> it's<00:05:04.550> kind<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:04.820> like

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
come to my finger it's kind of like

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.780 
come to my finger it's kind of like
electricity<00:05:05.420> like<00:05:05.870> me<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.590> just<00:05:07.100> like<00:05:07.250> find

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
electricity like me and just like find

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.930 
electricity like me and just like find
over<00:05:08.360> here<00:05:09.050> in<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.440> corner<00:05:09.500> all<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.790> apps

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
over here in this corner all the apps

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.530 
over here in this corner all the apps
come<00:05:11.270> towards<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:13.010> can<00:05:13.250> all<00:05:13.640> see<00:05:14.390> it's

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
come towards it so I can all see it's

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.870 
come towards it so I can all see it's
pretty<00:05:14.720> pretty<00:05:15.620> weird<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.340> cool<00:05:16.550> at<00:05:16.730> the<00:05:16.760> same

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
pretty pretty weird and cool at the same

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.790 
pretty pretty weird and cool at the same
time<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:17.900> as<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.110> can<00:05:18.170> see<00:05:18.350> they<00:05:18.500> had<00:05:18.590> that

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
time so as you can see they had that

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.340 
time so as you can see they had that
smooth<00:05:19.040> smooth<00:05:19.520> transition<00:05:20.120> like<00:05:20.270> i<00:05:20.390> said<00:05:20.630> but

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
smooth smooth transition like i said but

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.060 
smooth smooth transition like i said but
i'm<00:05:21.470> gonna<00:05:21.680> switch<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.920> back<00:05:22.130> to<00:05:22.340> none<00:05:22.990> and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
i'm gonna switch it back to none and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.510 
i'm gonna switch it back to none and
last<00:05:25.070> but<00:05:25.220> not<00:05:25.430> least<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:27.280> gravity<00:05:28.280> and

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
last but not least is the is gravity and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.670 
last but not least is the is gravity and
how<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:28.760> want<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.240> it<00:05:29.420> earth<00:05:30.050> is<00:05:30.440> what

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
how you want to have it earth is what

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.580 
how you want to have it earth is what
you're<00:05:30.830> gonna<00:05:30.920> have<00:05:31.040> normally<00:05:32.020> that's<00:05:33.020> normal

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
you're gonna have normally that's normal

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.760 
you're gonna have normally that's normal
one<00:05:33.710> that's<00:05:34.280> when<00:05:34.610> up<00:05:34.880> you<00:05:35.570> can<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:36.380> activate

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
one that's when up you can you activate

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.370 
one that's when up you can you activate
it<00:05:36.980> and<00:05:37.220> they<00:05:37.580> both<00:05:38.180> you<00:05:38.450> can<00:05:38.660> use

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
it and they both you can use

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.580 
it and they both you can use
accelerometer<00:05:40.220> as<00:05:40.370> well<00:05:41.330> as<00:05:41.570> um<00:05:41.840> kind<00:05:42.380> of<00:05:42.410> like

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
accelerometer as well as um kind of like

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.410 
accelerometer as well as um kind of like
flicking<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.310> won't<00:05:43.880> do<00:05:44.000> that's<00:05:44.210> all<00:05:44.300> right

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
flicking it won't do that's all right

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.510 
flicking it won't do that's all right
guys<00:05:44.630> it's<00:05:45.200> just<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.620> little<00:05:45.830> glitch<00:05:46.160> i<00:05:46.310> have<00:05:46.430> on

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
guys it's just a little glitch i have on

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.850 
guys it's just a little glitch i have on
my<00:05:46.550> itouch<00:05:46.850> but<00:05:47.660> you<00:05:47.840> can<00:05:48.020> kind<00:05:48.410> of<00:05:48.470> flick<00:05:48.710> them

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
my itouch but you can kind of flick them

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.360 
my itouch but you can kind of flick them
like<00:05:49.040> that<00:05:49.070> also<00:05:49.669> at<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:49.940> same<00:05:49.970> time<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:51.370> moon

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
like that also at the same time and moon

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.840 
like that also at the same time and moon
is<00:05:52.790> the<00:05:53.570> same<00:05:53.810> thing<00:05:53.840> but<00:05:54.200> slower<00:05:54.950> so<00:05:55.550> let's

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
is the same thing but slower so let's

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.780 
is the same thing but slower so let's
try<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:56.930> as<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:57.770> can<00:05:57.860> see<00:05:58.100> it's<00:05:58.250> really

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
try that as you can see it's really

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.790 
try that as you can see it's really
really<00:05:59.060> slow<00:05:59.330> you<00:05:59.600> can<00:05:59.780> still<00:06:00.050> flick<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.560> but

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
really slow you can still flick it but

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.940 
really slow you can still flick it but
really<00:06:01.520> really<00:06:01.880> slow<00:06:02.120> an<00:06:02.270> accelerometer<00:06:02.950> so

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
really really slow an accelerometer so

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.450 
really really slow an accelerometer so
that's<00:06:04.160> why<00:06:04.310> it's<00:06:04.340> called<00:06:04.550> moon<00:06:05.000> zero<00:06:05.750> gravity

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
that's why it's called moon zero gravity

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.260 
that's why it's called moon zero gravity
um<00:06:07.460> just<00:06:08.450> show<00:06:08.690> you<00:06:08.750> right<00:06:08.900> here<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:10.430> does<00:06:11.060> not

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
um just show you right here it does not

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.480 
um just show you right here it does not
involve<00:06:11.600> the<00:06:11.810> accelerometers<00:06:12.560> just<00:06:12.919> flicking

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
involve the accelerometers just flicking

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.680 
involve the accelerometers just flicking
the<00:06:13.700> apps<00:06:13.880> so<00:06:14.600> um<00:06:15.460> just<00:06:16.460> saying<00:06:16.760> that's<00:06:17.570> the

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
the apps so um just saying that's the

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.480 
the apps so um just saying that's the
only<00:06:17.840> infer<00:06:18.020> there<00:06:18.229> and<00:06:18.410> then<00:06:18.590> custom<00:06:19.160> I<00:06:19.280> never

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
only infer there and then custom I never

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.980 
only infer there and then custom I never
got<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:19.910> one<00:06:20.060> because<00:06:20.240> whenever<00:06:20.479> I<00:06:20.690> check<00:06:20.900> it

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
got that one because whenever I check it

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.140 
got that one because whenever I check it
off<00:06:21.080> as<00:06:21.320> these<00:06:21.560> like<00:06:22.160> zeroes<00:06:22.610> coming<00:06:23.030> down

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
off as these like zeroes coming down

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150 
off as these like zeroes coming down
here<00:06:23.390> so<00:06:23.540> i<00:06:23.570> really<00:06:23.870> don't<00:06:23.990> use<00:06:24.770> that<00:06:24.800> but

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
here so i really don't use that but

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.450 
here so i really don't use that but
earth<00:06:25.370> for<00:06:25.910> me<00:06:26.030> recommended<00:06:26.900> is<00:06:27.020> the<00:06:27.470> best<00:06:27.680> so

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
earth for me recommended is the best so

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.280 
earth for me recommended is the best so
that's<00:06:29.450> pretty<00:06:29.600> much<00:06:29.690> all<00:06:29.900> i<00:06:29.960> can<00:06:30.110> say<00:06:30.260> for

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
that's pretty much all i can say for

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.409 
that's pretty much all i can say for
this<00:06:30.500> video<00:06:30.800> i<00:06:30.860> know<00:06:31.100> it's<00:06:31.250> kind<00:06:31.430> of<00:06:31.520> long<00:06:31.729> but

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419
