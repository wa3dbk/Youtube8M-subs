quite articulate enough and I have to

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.220 
disagree in the case of the 600's I
think<00:04:09.489> they're<00:04:09.669> a<00:04:09.850> great<00:04:10.180> sounding<00:04:10.810> headphone

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230

a little bit they're still fairly warm

high frequency response although it is a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
I really love the sound of these

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.370 
I really love the sound of these
headphones<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:36.420> even<00:04:37.420> today<00:04:37.600> they<00:04:37.990> remain

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
headphones and even today they remain

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.730 
headphones and even today they remain
pretty<00:04:39.100> much<00:04:39.220> state<00:04:39.520> of<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.760> art<00:04:39.940> at<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.740> 399

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
pretty much state of the art at the 399

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.910 
pretty much state of the art at the 399
price<00:04:42.070> point<00:04:42.400> they<00:04:42.610> are<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.820> fabulous<00:04:43.920> sounding

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
price point they are a fabulous sounding

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.240 
price point they are a fabulous sounding
headphone<00:04:45.280> HD<00:04:45.820> 650<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:47.560> quite<00:04:47.860> similar<00:04:48.130> in

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
headphone HD 650 is quite similar in

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.060 
headphone HD 650 is quite similar in
sound<00:04:48.550> although<00:04:49.240> it's<00:04:49.630> even<00:04:50.140> a<00:04:50.230> little<00:04:50.380> warmer

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
sound although it's even a little warmer

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.750 
sound although it's even a little warmer
and<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.150> little<00:04:52.180> more<00:04:52.570> rolled<00:04:52.870> off<00:04:53.080> on<00:04:53.320> top<00:04:53.760> I

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
and a little more rolled off on top I

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.650 
and a little more rolled off on top I
think<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:59.880> resolution<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.120> little<00:05:01.510> bit

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
think the the resolution is a little bit

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.280 
think the the resolution is a little bit
better<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.350> it's<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.710> it's<00:05:03.160> a<00:05:03.280> little<00:05:03.670> bit<00:05:03.820> more

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
better so it's a it's a little bit more

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.620 
better so it's a it's a little bit more
resolving<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.270> articulate<00:05:07.270> although

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
resolving and and articulate although

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.860 
resolving and and articulate although
it's<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:08.020> little<00:05:08.170> more<00:05:08.560> rolled<00:05:08.920> off<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:10.510> a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
it's a little more rolled off and a

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.650 
it's a little more rolled off and a
little<00:05:11.320> thicker<00:05:11.980> in<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.430> base<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:12.940> this

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
little thicker in the base so this

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.370 
little thicker in the base so this
headphone<00:05:14.080> might<00:05:14.800> warrant<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:16.350> moniker<00:05:17.350> of

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
headphone might warrant the moniker of

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.000 
headphone might warrant the moniker of
being<00:05:18.030> veiled<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:19.420> it<00:05:19.600> remains<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.620> really

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
being veiled but it remains a really

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.070 
being veiled but it remains a really
good<00:05:21.280> headphone<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:22.390> tell<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.690> truth<00:05:22.900> I

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
good headphone to tell you the truth I

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.580 
good headphone to tell you the truth I
think<00:05:23.170> this<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:24.520> HD<00:05:24.880> 600<00:05:25.480> is<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.690> better<00:05:25.960> buy<00:05:26.230> at

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
think this the HD 600 is a better buy at

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.930 
think this the HD 600 is a better buy at
399<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:28.810> scales<00:05:29.380> very<00:05:29.590> well<00:05:30.070> you<00:05:30.340> can<00:05:30.550> work

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
399 it scales very well you can work

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.670 
399 it scales very well you can work
right<00:05:31.240> out<00:05:31.420> of<00:05:31.450> a<00:05:31.630> receivers<00:05:32.110> headphone<00:05:32.440> jack

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
right out of a receivers headphone jack

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.650 
right out of a receivers headphone jack
and<00:05:32.860> it'll<00:05:33.070> sound<00:05:33.250> good<00:05:33.520> but<00:05:34.060> if<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.480> invest

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
and it'll sound good but if you invest

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.900 
and it'll sound good but if you invest
in<00:05:34.990> a<00:05:35.140> more<00:05:35.680> expensive<00:05:36.010> amplifier<00:05:36.670> or

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
in a more expensive amplifier or

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.580 
in a more expensive amplifier or
front-end<00:05:37.420> it'll<00:05:37.630> certainly<00:05:37.840> be<00:05:38.050> worth<00:05:38.380> it

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
front-end it'll certainly be worth it

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.280 
front-end it'll certainly be worth it
they're<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> great<00:05:39.570> sounding<00:05:40.570> headphone<00:05:41.020> and

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
they're a great sounding headphone and

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.980 
they're a great sounding headphone and
will<00:05:42.100> scale<00:05:42.430> up<00:05:42.460> well<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:42.910> also<00:05:43.480> highly

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
will scale up well I also highly

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.350 
will scale up well I also highly
recommend<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:44.590> these<00:05:45.430> are<00:05:45.610> 300<00:05:46.240> ohm

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
recommend it these are 300 ohm

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.060 
recommend it these are 300 ohm
headphones<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:46.990> highly<00:05:47.470> recommend<00:05:47.500> them

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
hours with these headphones so the HD

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.090 
hours with these headphones so the HD
600<00:06:05.200> is<00:06:05.260> going<00:06:05.380> to<00:06:05.440> go<00:06:05.560> up<00:06:05.650> on<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.830> wall<00:06:06.040> of

600 is going to go up on the wall of

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.910 
600 is going to go up on the wall of
fame<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:07.390> HD<00:06:07.780> 650<00:06:08.140> will<00:06:08.440> certainly<00:06:08.710> get<00:06:08.860> a

strong recommendation from you but I

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.920 
strong recommendation from you but I
think<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.980> 600<00:06:12.640> is<00:06:12.760> probably<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.390> one<00:06:13.570> to<00:06:13.720> put

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
think the 600 is probably the one to put

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
think the 600 is probably the one to put
on<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.230> wall<00:06:14.440> of<00:06:14.590> fame<00:06:14.860> so<00:06:16.950> world-class
