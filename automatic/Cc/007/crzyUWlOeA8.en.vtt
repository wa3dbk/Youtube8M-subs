actually makes sense will it be cohesive

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
will it be engaging and to me I feel

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.249 
will it be engaging and to me I feel
like<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.820> rooted<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:22.049> in

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
like because it's not rooted so much in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.580 
like because it's not rooted so much in
trying<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.689> realistic<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.990> any<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.350> it's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
trying to be realistic in any way it's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
trying to be realistic in any way it's
got<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.950> supernatural<00:01:26.400> element<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.720> know

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
got this supernatural element you know

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
got this supernatural element you know
maybe<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.380> stuff<00:01:28.619> won't<00:01:28.829> matter<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
maybe that stuff won't matter so much so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.109 
maybe that stuff won't matter so much so
I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> maybe<00:01:30.810> perhaps<00:01:31.640> David<00:01:32.640> cajon

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I think that maybe perhaps David cajon

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
I think that maybe perhaps David cajon
Quantic<00:01:33.479> Dream<00:01:33.689> maybe<00:01:33.900> took<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.470> board<00:01:34.860> some

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
Quantic Dream maybe took on board some

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
Quantic Dream maybe took on board some
of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> criticisms<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> heavy<00:01:36.360> rain<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.750> like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
of the criticisms of heavy rain so like

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
of the criticisms of heavy rain so like
I'm<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.500> enjoyed<00:01:38.130> heavy<00:01:38.340> rain

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I'm like you I really enjoyed heavy rain

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.870 
I'm like you I really enjoyed heavy rain
I'm<00:01:38.850> again<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.590> were<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> look<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.640> really

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I'm again if I were to look at it really

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.819 
I'm again if I were to look at it really
closely<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.479> probably<00:01:42.780> could<00:01:43.170> unpick<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
closely i probably could unpick the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
closely i probably could unpick the
story<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> write<00:01:44.700> giants<00:01:45.420> potholes<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
story and write giants potholes but I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.830 
story and write giants potholes but I
chose<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.360> loved<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
chose not to because I really loved the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
chose not to because I really loved the
experience<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> time<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.159> hadn't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
experience and at the time I hadn't

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.740 
experience and at the time I hadn't
really<00:01:50.759> played<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> game<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> before

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
really played a game like that before

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.690 
really played a game like that before
sure<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.159> stayed<00:01:53.490> with

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
sure and so that it really stayed with

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.639 
sure and so that it really stayed with
me<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.810> excited<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.470> see

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
me and so I was really excited to see

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.410 
me and so I was really excited to see
what<00:01:55.860> David<00:01:56.369> cage<00:01:56.670> would<00:01:56.820> come<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.270> next

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
what David cage would come up with next

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.959 
what David cage would come up with next
so<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.829> say<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
so but as you say if this is in the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
so but as you say if this is in the
supernatural<00:02:00.390> realm<00:02:00.689> perhaps<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.070> know

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
supernatural realm perhaps you know

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
supernatural realm perhaps you know
that's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.640> way<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> forgive<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.689> maybe<00:02:03.899> he's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that's a way to forgive you maybe he's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's a way to forgive you maybe he's
worked<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.649> he's<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.159> good<00:02:05.520> moving

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
worked out that he's not so good moving

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.510 
worked out that he's not so good moving
his<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:06.659> exactly<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.770> perhaps<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
his right exactly so perhaps this is it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160 
his right exactly so perhaps this is it
sees<00:02:08.759> way<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> kind<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.420> across<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sees way to kind of get across that and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.660 
sees way to kind of get across that and
so<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.069> stuff<00:02:11.489> doesn't<00:02:11.849> make<00:02:11.970> sense<00:02:12.150> yeah

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so if stuff doesn't make sense yeah

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.750 
so if stuff doesn't make sense yeah
because<00:02:12.940> nothing<00:02:13.450> makes<00:02:13.480> sense<00:02:13.750> right<00:02:14.760> yeah

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
because nothing makes sense right yeah

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.880 
because nothing makes sense right yeah
so<00:02:16.390> he<00:02:16.870> has<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.020> speaking<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.530> stuff<00:02:17.709> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
so he has a speaking of stuff that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.710 
so he has a speaking of stuff that
didn't<00:02:18.280> make<00:02:18.370> sense<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:19.150> maybe<00:02:19.510> isn't

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
didn't make sense but maybe isn't

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.240 
didn't make sense but maybe isn't
supposed<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> make<00:02:20.380> sense<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.890> us<00:02:21.010> right<00:02:21.220> away

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
supposed to make sense to us right away

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.080 
supposed to make sense to us right away
so<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> premises<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.340> far<00:02:24.520> as<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.880> is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
so so the premises as far as we know is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.479 
so so the premises as far as we know is
that<00:02:25.390> they<00:02:26.260> dropped<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.890> name<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> main

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
that they dropped the name of the main

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.150 
that they dropped the name of the main
character<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.270> many<00:02:28.450> times<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.770> I've<00:02:29.890> kind

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160

demo just a lot of mood setting a lot of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.289 
demo just a lot of mood setting a lot of
this<00:02:53.290> interaction<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.220> cop<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.940> then

this interaction with this cop and then

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.020 
this interaction with this cop and then
there's<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:55.569> moment<00:02:55.870> where<00:02:56.549> where<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.580> cup<00:02:57.940> of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
there's this moment where where a cup of

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.990 
there's this moment where where a cup of
coffee<00:02:58.090> kind<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.519> levitates<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.700> then<00:03:00.850> just

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
coffee kind of levitates and then just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.530 
coffee kind of levitates and then just
flies<00:03:01.690> against<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> wall<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.650> shatters<00:03:03.160> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
flies against the wall and shatters and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.570 
flies against the wall and shatters and
that<00:03:04.540> cops<00:03:04.840> took<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.440> way<00:03:05.680> boy<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.010> stride

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
that cops took that way boy in stride

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.900 
that cops took that way boy in stride
well<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.540> guess<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.080> was<00:03:08.200> like<00:03:08.610> he's<00:03:09.610> okay

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.970 
well I guess that it was like he's okay
I'm<00:03:10.120> just<00:03:10.209> gonna<00:03:10.480> go<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.959> was<00:03:11.140> gonna<00:03:11.290> believe<00:03:11.560> so

I'm get at this when i'm getting i'm

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.740 
I'm get at this when i'm getting i'm
gonna<00:04:08.739> guess<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:08.980> yes<00:04:09.430> we<00:04:09.700> are<00:04:09.850> i<00:04:10.120> think<00:04:10.359> well

gonna guess that yes we are i think well

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.900 
gonna guess that yes we are i think well
I<00:04:11.019> can't<00:04:11.680> think<00:04:11.889> of<00:04:12.040> exactly<00:04:12.489> what<00:04:12.700> they'll<00:04:12.880> be

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
I can't think of exactly what they'll be

I can't think of exactly what they'll be
but<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.269> imagine<00:04:13.720> there<00:04:13.840> will<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.049> few<00:04:14.380> new

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
but I imagine there will be a few new

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.340 
but I imagine there will be a few new
wrinkles<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.190> gameplay<00:04:16.049> maybe<00:04:17.049> you'll

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
wrinkles in the gameplay maybe you'll
