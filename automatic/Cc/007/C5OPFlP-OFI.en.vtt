 there are grapes there is wine there is a stage 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.950
 being red with the light of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.580

 raven english string quartet celebrates 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.700
 25 years of the monte xanic wine house 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.300
 baja california is getting closer 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.910
 to consolidate its diversity in the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.610
 production of wine is recognized 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.670
 agricultural capacity water quality and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.890
 the earth the climate and this immense valley 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.290
 of guadeloupe which is the cradle of one of 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.430
 the best known wines worldwide 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.730
 and it's Mexican is monte chan and it's been a 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.070
 path that listens to us like 25 years 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.490
 listen a lot but it has really been very 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.280
 fast for us because they mean 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.430
 many as we have broken many paradigms 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.290
 then it has been something very exciting 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.690
 because to date we follow it 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.909
 doing with our different 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.149
 strategies 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.520
 I think the saying that a company 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.039
 I change the destiny of wine in Mexico 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.469
 it is difficult to understand and to believe but 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.030
 this happened because there really were no 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.189
 the prime wines in mexico when 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.439
 we are born of yannick born with the idea of 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.490
 be the best Mexican wine and through 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.630
 this scheme is how a whole 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.360
 new market within the industry of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.280
 mexico a project with family roots 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.500
 that seeks to show the vineyard as a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.459
 unique place for its diversity in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.920
 constant evolution we are in Mexico 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.240
 producing Mexican wines made here 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.070
 in Mexican lands 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.290
 Give them a chance for the wines 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.980
 Mexicans give an opportunity to 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.140
 learn from Mexican wines 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.790
 when they are at a point of sale in a 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.730
 restaurant and have the option of 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.670
 buy a Mexican wine and experience 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.490
 decide for mexico a merger of the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.540
 wealth with the world wine and seafood 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.760
 wine and cheese came and life now I'm 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.820
 completely surprised at what it is 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.360
 what is coming this weekend 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.690
 both love the passion with what they are 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.150
 making the wines in monte xanic it 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.710
 palpated feels no and not to give 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.490
 many rolls I think it's something 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.790
 it brings so much the passion of whoever does it 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.159
 the dedication that they put 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.329
 white wines and red wines that 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.569
 they are making you start to get 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.700
 a quality or already has a quality of 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.530
 respect and together with the gastronomy that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 also around all this the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.450
 Respect for the product, respect for 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.390
 raw material are made from inlet to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.030
 me something that is boiling does not 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.489
 a bomb starts who is nothing 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.310
 human being and the area thanking 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.130
 always to the house to the land to the valley 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.330
 from Guadalupe 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.280
 Mount Xanic is nothing without the terroir 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.860
 then if we did not have this land 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.220
 all this variable factors that make 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.840
 that we could produce good wines 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.630
 montesiÃ³n and never been born 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.710
 then mount Zion and he owes everything to 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.710
 this part of baja california 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.830
 because they are 25 years wine seduces the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.340
 wine provides an excuse to awaken the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.050
 sensitivity the wine seduces 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.060
 it's probably the number one seducer 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.220
 It is an aphrodisiac 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.980
 you have seen it after the first cup 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.069
 how we will shame it 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.580
 we change the become different from 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.140
 fact it is said that we are all mortal 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.380
 until the first kiss and the second cup 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.380
 of wine 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.239
 and that his commitment is to promote with 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.120
 high levels of quality production 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.000
 wine as well as change the valley 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.660
 they change the grapes and they change the wines of 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.660
 Montana 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.500
 the land that is the great wine that 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.620
 produces the house monte chan and that for 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.389
