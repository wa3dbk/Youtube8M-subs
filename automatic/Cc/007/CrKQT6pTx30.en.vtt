this<00:01:05.880> soil<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.020> basically<00:01:07.620> where<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.040> saw

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
this soil this is basically where we saw

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
this soil this is basically where we saw
we<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> start<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.960> tomato<00:01:10.350> seeds

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
