Liverpool<00:00:17.350> so<00:00:18.350> here's<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.859> clean<00:00:19.040> tone<00:00:19.220> and

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
Liverpool so here's the clean tone and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.200 
Liverpool so here's the clean tone and
I'm<00:00:19.940> playing<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.270> strat<00:00:20.600> with<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:20.810> bridge<00:00:21.110> pickup

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:56.509 

okay<00:00:29.210> here's<00:00:29.600> the<00:00:29.750> cracked<00:00:30.020> AC

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.549 

and<00:00:57.519> here's<00:00:57.850> Liverpool<00:00:58.449> I<00:00:58.690> intentionally

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
and here's Liverpool I intentionally

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.350 
and here's Liverpool I intentionally
sort<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.040> said<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.519> be<00:01:00.610> somewhat<00:01:01.000> similar

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
sort of said it to be somewhat similar

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
sort of said it to be somewhat similar
sounding

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780 

not<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:10.140> similar-sounding<00:01:10.830> let's<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.700> if

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
not really similar-sounding let's see if

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.810 
not really similar-sounding let's see if
i<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:11.940> tweak<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
i can tweak it a little bit to be a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:34.749 
i can tweak it a little bit to be a
little<00:01:15.210> closer

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.980 

all<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> could

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
all right so I don't know if you could

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.460 
all right so I don't know if you could
tell<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> difference<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.640> video<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
tell the difference on the video but the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.310 
tell the difference on the video but the
cracked<00:01:40.740> AC<00:01:40.979> sounds<00:01:41.729> sort<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:43.080> more

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
cracked AC sounds sort of a a bit more

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.510 
cracked AC sounds sort of a a bit more
livelier<00:01:44.330> as<00:01:45.680> sort<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.799> better<00:01:47.040> sort<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
livelier as sort of a better sort of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
livelier as sort of a better sort of
faster<00:01:48.060> attack<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.780> sort<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> more

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
faster attack and sort of a more

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
faster attack and sort of a more
response<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.149> know<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
response to it which I know is kind of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:07.250 
response to it which I know is kind of
hard<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.200> come<00:01:52.289> across<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.950> videos

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.930 

because<00:02:07.830> he<00:02:07.920> has<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.040> it's<00:02:08.430> a<00:02:08.550> three<00:02:08.760> dollar

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
because he has a it's a three dollar

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.490 
because he has a it's a three dollar
pedal<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.420> mean<00:02:09.540> obviously<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.050> range<00:02:10.290> it's

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
pedal I mean obviously it's range it's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.630 
pedal I mean obviously it's range it's
kind<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:10.740> limited<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.820> just<00:02:12.030> darken<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
kind of limited we can just darken it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
kind of limited we can just darken it
make<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> seem<00:02:15.000> kind<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.300> far<00:02:15.510> away<00:02:15.600> or<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.440> can

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
make it seem kind of far away or we can

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.660 
make it seem kind of far away or we can
brighten<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.820> more<00:02:17.940> Karen

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.080 

but<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:24.080> overall<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.770> response<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.819> really

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
but just overall just response is really

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:49.860 
but just overall just response is really
excellent<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.110> go<00:02:27.260> logging

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.160 

-<00:02:52.299> higher<00:02:53.299> Distortion

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
- higher Distortion

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:56.680 
- higher Distortion
I<00:02:56.799> don't<00:02:57.799> know<00:02:57.889> me<00:02:57.980> too<00:02:58.159> loud

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.660 

so<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.960> definitely<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.590> sort<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.040> Brian<00:03:59.460> May

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
so it's definitely a sort of a Brian May

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.060 
so it's definitely a sort of a Brian May
side<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.860> Vox<00:04:01.860> sound<00:04:02.280> definitely<00:04:03.650> but<00:04:04.650> just

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
side of Vox sound definitely but just

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.160 
side of Vox sound definitely but just
see<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.370> low-end<00:04:06.030> gets<00:04:06.240> somewhat<00:04:06.750> tighter

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
see the low-end gets somewhat tighter

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.580 
see the low-end gets somewhat tighter
when<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.590> turn<00:04:07.860> up<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.420> gain<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.990> can

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
when you turn up the gain so it can

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.000 
when you turn up the gain so it can
almost<00:04:10.800> sound<00:04:11.220> martially<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.840> way<00:04:13.020> so<00:04:13.080> it's

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
almost sound martially in a way so it's

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.580 
almost sound martially in a way so it's
really<00:04:14.160> not<00:04:14.400> fold<00:04:14.730> out<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.180> know<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.660> very

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
really not fold out you know the very

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.070 
really not fold out you know the very
faithful<00:04:17.750> recreation<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.380> C<00:04:20.300> tone<00:04:21.300> but<00:04:21.810> at

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
faithful recreation of a C tone but at

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.840 
faithful recreation of a C tone but at
the<00:04:22.290> same<00:04:22.440> time<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:23.070> know<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.340> might<00:04:23.820> just

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
the same time you know it might just

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.940 
the same time you know it might just
really<00:04:24.390> fit<00:04:24.630> somebody<00:04:24.870> sweet<00:04:25.350> spot<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.830> know

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
really fit somebody sweet spot you know

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.230 
really fit somebody sweet spot you know
if<00:04:26.040> you're<00:04:26.220> not<00:04:26.460> really<00:04:26.700> looking<00:04:27.000> for<00:04:27.210> a

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
if you're not really looking for a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.080 
if you're not really looking for a
purist<00:04:27.690> kind<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.230> box<00:04:29.010> sound<00:04:29.460> now<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.730> this

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
purist kind of a box sound now on this

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.600 
purist kind of a box sound now on this
on<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.510> other<00:04:30.600> hand<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.960> Liverpool<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:35.250> just

on the other hand the Liverpool it just
every<00:04:36.270> knob<00:04:36.510> has<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> huge<00:04:37.350> range<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.270> could

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
every knob has a huge range so I could

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.700 
every knob has a huge range so I could
just

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710

mid<00:05:36.550> control<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.449> if<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:37.810> turn<00:05:37.990> it<00:05:38.139> up<00:05:38.260> the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
mid control so if you turn it up the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:56.450 
mid control so if you turn it up the
gain<00:05:39.389> gets<00:05:40.389> more

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.740 

-<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:59.250> know<00:05:59.370> if<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.640> turn<00:05:59.910> it<00:06:00.030> down<00:06:00.270> that<00:06:00.570> it's

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
- you know if you turn it down that it's

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.670 
- you know if you turn it down that it's
thinner<00:06:02.690> cleaner<00:06:03.690> sound<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.200> can<00:06:04.410> turn<00:06:04.560> up

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
thinner cleaner sound you can turn up

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:19.670 
thinner cleaner sound you can turn up
the<00:06:04.860> game<00:06:16.220> with<00:06:17.450> this<00:06:18.450> one<00:06:18.660> you<00:06:19.200> get<00:06:19.350> more<00:06:19.620> of

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
the game with this one you get more of

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.920 
the game with this one you get more of
that<00:06:19.740> chai<00:06:20.130> me<00:06:20.190> top<00:06:20.550> end<00:06:20.850> of<00:06:21.090> what<00:06:21.420> you<00:06:21.450> expect

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
that chai me top end of what you expect

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:30.379 
that chai me top end of what you expect
from<00:06:22.050> Vox

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:46.789 

put<00:06:31.170> it<00:06:31.260> in<00:06:31.560> between<00:06:31.710> position

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:46.799 

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:51.119 

so<00:06:47.799> it<00:06:48.249> just<00:06:48.459> has<00:06:48.699> a<00:06:48.729> huge<00:06:49.149> range<00:06:49.539> of<00:06:50.129> sounds

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
so it just has a huge range of sounds

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.369 
so it just has a huge range of sounds
and<00:06:51.309> but<00:06:51.999> the<00:06:52.569> difference<00:06:52.929> between<00:06:53.079> the

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379 
and but the difference between the

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.109 
and but the difference between the
cranked<00:06:53.739> AC<00:06:53.889> and<00:06:54.189> the<00:06:54.279> Liverpool<00:06:54.759> is<00:06:54.909> the

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:55.119 
cranked AC and the Liverpool is the

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.569 
cranked AC and the Liverpool is the
Liverpool<00:06:55.719> is<00:06:56.189> doesn't<00:06:57.189> quite<00:06:57.339> have<00:06:57.549> that

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:57.579 
Liverpool is doesn't quite have that

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:59.909 
Liverpool is doesn't quite have that
dynamic<00:06:57.999> response<00:06:58.899> or<00:06:59.139> the<00:06:59.199> immediate<00:06:59.379> attack

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
dynamic response or the immediate attack

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.419 
dynamic response or the immediate attack
of<00:07:00.309> of<00:07:00.669> the<00:07:01.149> cranked<00:07:01.599> AC<00:07:01.839> while<00:07:02.769> the<00:07:02.889> Liverpool

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:03.429 
of of the cranked AC while the Liverpool

00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:06.119 
of of the cranked AC while the Liverpool
has<00:07:04.029> more<00:07:04.389> sag<00:07:04.659> to<00:07:05.049> it<00:07:05.229> and<00:07:05.379> then<00:07:05.679> you<00:07:05.919> know<00:07:06.039> it

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:06.129 
has more sag to it and then you know it

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.519 
has more sag to it and then you know it
doesn't<00:07:06.819> quite<00:07:07.119> have<00:07:07.179> the<00:07:07.329> dynamic<00:07:07.869> range<00:07:08.079> so

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
doesn't quite have the dynamic range so

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.769 
doesn't quite have the dynamic range so
in<00:07:09.099> on<00:07:09.519> one<00:07:09.699> hand<00:07:09.999> it's<00:07:10.119> a<00:07:10.179> little<00:07:10.209> easier<00:07:10.749> to

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 
in on one hand it's a little easier to

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.399 
in on one hand it's a little easier to
play<00:07:12.149> but<00:07:13.149> on<00:07:13.329> the<00:07:13.449> other<00:07:13.539> hand<00:07:13.869> doesn't<00:07:14.139> quite

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409 
play but on the other hand doesn't quite

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.819 
play but on the other hand doesn't quite
have<00:07:14.619> the<00:07:14.649> range<00:07:14.949> of<00:07:15.189> sort<00:07:15.399> of<00:07:15.429> liveliness<00:07:15.969> or

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:16.829 
have the range of sort of liveliness or

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:18.719 
have the range of sort of liveliness or
expressions<00:07:17.829> that<00:07:18.069> you<00:07:18.189> can<00:07:18.399> get<00:07:18.549> from

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
expressions that you can get from

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.239

modeling you know kind of thing it just
the<00:07:28.389> range<00:07:28.539> of<00:07:28.749> expression<00:07:29.289> isn't<00:07:29.469> quite<00:07:30.159> as

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:30.309 
the range of expression isn't quite as

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:32.249 
the range of expression isn't quite as
good<00:07:30.549> and<00:07:30.789> your<00:07:31.179> guitar<00:07:31.599> feels<00:07:31.839> a<00:07:31.959> little<00:07:32.049> bit
