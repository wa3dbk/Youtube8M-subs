small<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.189> medium<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.880> large<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.540> type<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
small to medium to large a type of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
small to medium to large a type of
structure<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.970> jewelry<00:01:15.840> stand<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
structure to my jewelry stand and that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
structure to my jewelry stand and that
is<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.729> doing<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.299> now

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
is what I'm going to be doing here now

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
is what I'm going to be doing here now
you<00:01:18.900> take<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> candle<00:01:19.740> holder<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.580> are

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you take the candle holder and you are

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
you take the candle holder and you are
going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> glue<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> bottom<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
going to glue that on the bottom of the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.120 
going to glue that on the bottom of the
jewelry<00:01:23.759> stand<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.500> biggest<00:01:25.680> step

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
jewelry stand so that's the biggest step

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
jewelry stand so that's the biggest step
plate<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.299> case<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.500> fact

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
plate for me in this case and in fact

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
plate for me in this case and in fact
you'll<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.759> later<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> switch

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you'll actually see later that I switch

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.140 
you'll actually see later that I switch
the<00:01:30.930> side<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.560> put<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> base<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the side I actually put the base of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.289 
the side I actually put the base of the
candle<00:01:33.390> holder<00:01:33.960> instead<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> top<00:01:35.299> because

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
candle holder instead of the top because

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.700 
candle holder instead of the top because
I<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.530> looked<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.320> can

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
I just like the way it looked so you can

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.649 
I just like the way it looked so you can
basically<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.400> everything<00:01:41.759> together<00:01:42.090> it's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
basically put everything together it's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.530 
basically put everything together it's
very<00:01:43.170> easy<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.829> long<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.390> middle

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
very easy as long as you have the middle

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.440 
very easy as long as you have the middle
spot<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.320> each<00:01:46.530> plate<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.210> very

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
spot on each plate and just be very

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
spot on each plate and just be very
careful<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.140> six-thousand<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> tends<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
careful with six-thousand it tends to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
careful with six-thousand it tends to
move<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.780> hold<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
move a little bit if you don't hold it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
move a little bit if you don't hold it
down<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.640> more<00:01:53.880> than<00:01:54.030> 10<00:01:54.329> seconds

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
down for you know more than 10 seconds

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
down for you know more than 10 seconds
