00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.970 
hanging out so i'll click this out of
the<00:02:58.489> way<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:03.170> give<00:03:03.290> me<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.470> bugs<00:03:03.680> two

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the way you give me the bugs two

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.199 
the way you give me the bugs two
different<00:03:04.310> ways<00:03:04.459> um<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:06.880> believe<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.060> way<00:03:08.180> I

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
different ways um I believe the way I

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.550 
different ways um I believe the way I
did<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.630> before<00:03:08.930> as<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:10.400> featured<00:03:10.940> on<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:12.260> blog

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
did it before as is featured on the blog

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.900 
did it before as is featured on the blog
and<00:03:12.950> her<00:03:13.010> website<00:03:13.310> was<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:13.970> using<00:03:14.180> hair<00:03:15.140> pins

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
and her website was just using hair pins

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.860 
and her website was just using hair pins
so<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.620> pin<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.220> hair<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.579> in<00:03:22.730> place<00:03:23.030> to

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
so you just pin the hair is in place to

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.360 
so you just pin the hair is in place to
create<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.380> illusion<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:27.290> bun<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.310> you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
create the illusion of a bun so you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.160 
create the illusion of a bun so you
actually<00:03:28.819> works<00:03:29.269> really<00:03:29.360> well<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.900> use<00:03:30.019> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
actually works really well to use the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.699 
actually works really well to use the
hair<00:03:30.349> pins<00:03:30.620> because<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.160> make<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
hair pins because then you can make the

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:45.870 
hair pins because then you can make the
button<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.920> guess<00:03:34.489> as<00:03:35.079> full<00:03:36.079> as<00:03:36.319> you<00:03:36.470> want

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.170 

so<00:03:46.710> that<00:03:47.710> kind<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.010> looks<00:03:48.160> like<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.310> bond<00:03:48.970> i'll

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
so that kind of looks like a bond i'll

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:59.180 
so that kind of looks like a bond i'll
just<00:03:49.950> stick<00:03:50.950> one<00:03:51.220> more<00:03:51.430> pin<00:03:51.730> here

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.940 

so<00:03:59.760> there's<00:03:59.970> one<00:04:00.210> and<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.350> just<00:04:01.530> make<00:04:01.800> up

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
so there's one and then you just make up

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:15.220 
so there's one and then you just make up
on<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> other<00:04:03.380> section<00:04:04.380> two

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.129 

and<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.910> can<00:04:17.060> make<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.359> section<00:04:17.660> as<00:04:17.780> big<00:04:17.989> or

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
and you can make the section as big or

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.120 
and you can make the section as big or
small<00:04:18.290> as<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.650> want<00:04:20.470> I'll<00:04:21.470> probably<00:04:21.859> have

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
small as you want I'll probably have

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.920 
small as you want I'll probably have
made<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:22.520> top<00:04:22.910> section<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.479> little<00:04:23.780> bit

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
made this top section a little bit

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.870 
made this top section a little bit
smaller<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.740> had<00:04:25.280> more<00:04:25.520> fullness<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:27.880> one

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
smaller and had more fullness in the one

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:39.040 
smaller and had more fullness in the one
in<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.150> back

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.580 

then

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
then

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.900 
then
that's<00:04:41.280> basically<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.180> gist<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.900> can

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
that's basically the gist of it you can

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.210 
that's basically the gist of it you can
see<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:47.990> that's<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.230> that's<00:04:49.470> double<00:04:49.830> bonds<00:04:50.040> I

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
see that that's it that's double bonds I

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.570 
see that that's it that's double bonds I
think<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:52.040> picture<00:04:53.040> they<00:04:53.250> were<00:04:53.400> like

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
think in the picture they were like

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.850 
think in the picture they were like
closer<00:04:54.120> down<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.960> ear<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.410> can<00:04:55.500> put

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
closer down to the ear so you can put

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.890 
closer down to the ear so you can put
the<00:04:56.010> elastic<00:04:56.250> or<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.760> red<00:04:56.940> light<00:04:57.150> that's

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
the elastic or a red light that's

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.420 
the elastic or a red light that's
basically<00:04:58.380> how<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.830> did<00:04:59.160> it<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:01.770> hopefully<00:05:02.100> like

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
basically how I did it so hopefully like

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.190 
basically how I did it so hopefully like
that<00:05:02.910> it's<00:05:03.210> really<00:05:03.600> easy<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.930> do<00:05:04.170> especially

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
that it's really easy to do especially

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.530 
that it's really easy to do especially
if<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.800> have<00:05:04.830> some<00:05:05.130> old<00:05:05.310> hair<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:06.390> need

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
if you have some old hair and you need

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.350 
if you have some old hair and you need
