I've been carrying it consistently for

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.140 
I've been carrying it consistently for
the<00:00:40.660> year<00:00:40.900> I<00:00:41.080> have<00:00:41.920> one<00:00:42.129> other<00:00:42.280> bag<00:00:42.489> that<00:00:42.730> it's

the year I have one other bag that it's
a<00:00:43.300> little<00:00:43.449> smaller<00:00:43.809> not<00:00:44.170> as<00:00:44.320> bulky<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:45.370> I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
a little smaller not as bulky that I

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.680 
a little smaller not as bulky that I
kind<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.699> let<00:00:45.909> switch<00:00:46.089> out<00:00:46.300> but<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.629> is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
kind of let switch out but this is

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.780 
kind of let switch out but this is
definitely<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.290> bag<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:47.949> carry<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.550> most

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
definitely the bag that I carry the most

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.430 
definitely the bag that I carry the most
I<00:00:49.089> mean<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.510> especially<00:00:49.629> when<00:00:50.140> you're<00:00:50.229> paying

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
I mean and especially when you're paying

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.110 
I mean and especially when you're paying
such<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.949> high<00:00:51.070> price<00:00:51.309> tag<00:00:51.549> you<00:00:51.729> want<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.000> be

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
such a high price tag you want to be

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.369 
such a high price tag you want to be
able<00:00:52.299> to<00:00:52.390> get<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.629> most<00:00:52.780> out<00:00:52.989> of<00:00:53.049> it

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
able to get the most out of it

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.039 
able to get the most out of it
so<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:54.159> will<00:00:54.670> say<00:00:54.940> probably<00:00:55.479> not<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.720> wisest

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
so I will say probably not the wisest

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.960 
so I will say probably not the wisest
choice<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.409> go<00:00:56.559> traveling<00:00:57.220> around<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.940> world

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
choice to go traveling around the world

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.090 
choice to go traveling around the world
with<00:00:58.290> especially<00:00:59.290> an<00:00:59.379> airport<00:00:59.769> through

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
with especially an airport through

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.549 
with especially an airport through
security<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.570> I've<00:01:01.780> gotten<00:01:02.110> away<00:01:02.170> with<00:01:02.260> it

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
security but I've gotten away with it

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.840 
security but I've gotten away with it
they<00:01:02.799> don't<00:01:02.979> give<00:01:03.129> me<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.309> lot<00:01:03.610> of<00:01:03.640> trouble

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
they don't give me a lot of trouble

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.520 
they don't give me a lot of trouble
about<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.239> it's<00:01:04.629> just<00:01:04.839> definitely<00:01:05.110> not<00:01:05.440> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
about it it's just definitely not the

carry this with me on flights just

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.779 
carry this with me on flights just
because<00:01:35.740> your<00:01:35.859> skin<00:01:36.280> gets<00:01:36.490> actually

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
because your skin gets actually

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.179 
because your skin gets actually
dehydrated<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:38.409> nice<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.619> kind<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.009> just
