00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to know how to think inside and think

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.319 
to know how to think inside and think
logically<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.750> effectively<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.980> lot<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.120> way

logically and effectively a lot a way

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
logically and effectively a lot a way
when<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:01.260> writing<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> sentence<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.370> you're

when we're writing a sentence if you're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.020 
when we're writing a sentence if you're
going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.439> violate<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> rules<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.010> grammar<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
going to violate the rules of grammar it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
going to violate the rules of grammar it
helps<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> lot<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> rules

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
helps a lot if you know what the rules

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.520 
helps a lot if you know what the rules
of<00:01:07.500> grammar<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> begin<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:09.530> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
of grammar are to begin with the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
of grammar are to begin with the
fundamental<00:01:11.220> idea<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.820> economics<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.659> the

fundamental idea in economics and the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.120 
fundamental idea in economics and the
one<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.110> start<00:01:13.380> off<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
one that we start off with in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.810 
one that we start off with in
microeconomic<00:01:15.090> theory<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.820> everyone

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
microeconomic theory is that everyone

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.359 
microeconomic theory is that everyone
does<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.630> best<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.340> under<00:01:20.340> the

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.030 
volumes they all have the same
proportions<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.580> height<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.240> can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
proportions the height of the can

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.830 
proportions the height of the can
relative<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> diameter<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.810> same

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
relative to the diameter is the same

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.490 
relative to the diameter is the same
regardless<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.160> actual<00:02:16.610> size<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.090> can

regardless of the actual size of the can

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380 
regardless of the actual size of the can
the<00:02:18.500> reason<00:02:18.830> for<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.550> someone<00:02:20.209> has

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
the reason for that is that someone has

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.120 
the reason for that is that someone has
sat<00:02:20.600> down<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.110> thought<00:02:21.170> about<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.830> again

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
sat down and thought about that again

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.400 
sat down and thought about that again
and<00:02:22.459> thought<00:02:23.270> about<00:02:23.510> what's<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.140> most

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
and thought about what's the most

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.180 
and thought about what's the most
effective<00:02:25.010> way<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.489> build<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.190> they've

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
effective way to build one and they've

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.310 
effective way to build one and they've
basically<00:02:28.459> designed<00:02:29.120> your<00:02:29.300> average<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:30.020> to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
basically designed your average can to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.220 
basically designed your average can to
minimize<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.970> amount<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.300> material<00:02:32.989> amount

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
minimize the amount of material amount

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.960 
minimize the amount of material amount
of<00:02:33.350> metal<00:02:33.650> that's<00:02:33.830> in<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.250> canvas<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:34.820> your

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of metal that's in the canvas so your

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.030 
of metal that's in the canvas so your
average<00:02:35.120> can<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.019> height<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.709> is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
average can the height of the can is

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.000 
average can the height of the can is
about<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.180> quarter<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.500> size<00:02:39.530> of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
about one and a quarter the size of

about one and a quarter the size of
diameter<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.820> can<00:02:41.440> now<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:42.709> you're

diameter of the can now if you're

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.110 
diameter of the can now if you're
thinking<00:02:42.950> like<00:02:43.220> an<00:02:43.340> economist<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> first

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
thinking like an economist the first

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.060 
thinking like an economist the first
thing<00:02:44.300> you'll<00:02:44.420> think<00:02:44.540> about<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.950> there

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
thing you'll think about is but there

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.530 
thing you'll think about is but there
are<00:02:46.160> cans<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.580> my<00:02:46.610> pantry<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.060> don't<00:02:47.360> fit

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
are cans in my pantry that don't fit

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.290 
are cans in my pantry that don't fit
that<00:02:47.690> shape<00:02:47.989> some<00:02:48.920> cans<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.459> short<00:02:49.940> and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
that shape some cans are short and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.140 
that shape some cans are short and
stocky<00:02:50.630> other<00:02:51.560> cans<00:02:51.890> are<00:02:52.130> narrow<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.790> skinny

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
stocky other cans are narrow and skinny

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.449 
stocky other cans are narrow and skinny
if<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.480> think<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.840> coca-cola<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:54.830> it's

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
if you think of a coca-cola can it's

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.090 
if you think of a coca-cola can it's
it's<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.600> narrower<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.500> taller<00:02:57.800> than

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
it's it's narrower and it's taller than

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.580 
it's it's narrower and it's taller than
your<00:02:58.220> average<00:02:58.400> soup<00:02:58.940> can<00:02:59.209> if<00:03:00.110> you're<00:03:00.260> thinking

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
your average soup can if you're thinking

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.870 
your average soup can if you're thinking
like<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.920> then<00:03:01.160> you're<00:03:01.310> already<00:03:01.579> thinking

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
like that then you're already thinking

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.699 
like that then you're already thinking
like<00:03:02.060> an<00:03:02.299> economist<00:03:02.870> because<00:03:03.230> you're<00:03:03.350> asking

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
like an economist because you're asking

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.920 
like an economist because you're asking
yourself<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.239> understand<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.450> maybe<00:03:05.600> an

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
yourself I understand that maybe an

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.280 
yourself I understand that maybe an
ordinary<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:07.450> minimizes<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.690> cost<00:03:08.930> of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
ordinary can minimizes the cost of

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.890 
ordinary can minimizes the cost of
material<00:03:09.739> but<00:03:10.489> why<00:03:10.970> would<00:03:11.209> somebody<00:03:11.420> build<00:03:11.780> a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
material but why would somebody build a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.470 
material but why would somebody build a
different<00:03:12.049> kind<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:14.000> answer<00:03:14.209> that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
different kind of can and to answer that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.970 
different kind of can and to answer that
you<00:03:14.630> might<00:03:14.660> just<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.200> take<00:03:15.380> an<00:03:15.500> economics

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
you might just have to take an economics

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.199 
you might just have to take an economics
course<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:19.010> typical<00:03:19.670> course<00:03:19.940> in

microeconomics starts off talking about

charge me a price to get in the store

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.320 
charge me a price to get in the store
and<00:04:08.100> when<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.280> get<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.730> store<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.180> to

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
and when I get in the store I have to

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.540 
and when I get in the store I have to
pay<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> price<00:04:09.780> for<00:04:10.080> each<00:04:10.200> item<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.709> buy<00:04:10.980> why

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
pay a price for each item that I buy why

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.220 
pay a price for each item that I buy why
is<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:11.970> some<00:04:12.239> firms<00:04:12.420> price<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:13.050> way

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
is it that some firms price one way

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.680 
is it that some firms price one way
versus<00:04:14.010> another<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:15.000> those<00:04:15.180> are<00:04:15.300> typical

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
versus another so those are typical

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.629 
versus another so those are typical

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
kinds of questions that we would ask in

of<00:04:36.300> things<00:04:36.600> but<00:04:37.200> economics<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.710> also<00:04:37.979> very

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
of things but economics is also very

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.450 
of things but economics is also very
wide<00:04:38.930> in<00:04:39.930> its<00:04:40.169> scope<00:04:40.410> as<00:04:40.620> well<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:40.860> mean<00:04:41.160> we<00:04:41.340> have

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
wide in its scope as well I mean we have

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.360 
wide in its scope as well I mean we have
courses<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:42.030> labor<00:04:42.330> economics<00:04:42.990> in<00:04:43.370> taxation

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
courses in labor economics in taxation

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.180 
courses in labor economics in taxation
in<00:04:44.850> public<00:04:45.270> economics<00:04:45.530> we<00:04:46.530> teach<00:04:46.710> courses<00:04:46.979> in

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
in public economics we teach courses in

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.279 
in public economics we teach courses in
environment<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.120> regulation<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.140> an

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
environment and regulation and an

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.830 
environment and regulation and an
industrial<00:04:49.890> organization<00:04:50.729> we<00:04:51.539> have<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> lot<00:04:51.810> of

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
industrial organization we have a lot of

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.719 
industrial organization we have a lot of
courses<00:04:52.229> right<00:04:52.380> now<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.710> game<00:04:52.950> theory<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.550> look

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
courses right now on game theory to look

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.180 
courses right now on game theory to look
at<00:04:53.850> strategic<00:04:54.120> behavior<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.229> how<00:04:55.770> people

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
at strategic behavior and how people

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.130 
at strategic behavior and how people
interact<00:04:56.310> with<00:04:56.820> one<00:04:57.000> another<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.390> they<00:04:57.720> when

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
interact with one another and they when

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.580 
interact with one another and they when
they<00:04:58.229> can't<00:04:58.500> ignore<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.550> behavior<00:04:59.789> of<00:05:00.180> others

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
they can't ignore the behavior of others

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.430 
they can't ignore the behavior of others
and<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:01.830> economics<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.850> wide<00:05:03.180> field<00:05:03.600> that's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
and so economics is a wide field that's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.880 
and so economics is a wide field that's
generally<00:05:04.979> looking<00:05:05.310> at<00:05:05.490> how<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:07.140> why<00:05:07.470> people

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
generally looking at how and why people

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.670 
generally looking at how and why people
behave<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.280> way<00:05:08.550> they<00:05:08.700> do<00:05:08.760> as<00:05:09.690> such<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.380> it's

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
behave the way they do as such it's it's

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.250 
behave the way they do as such it's it's
a<00:05:10.830> competitor<00:05:11.460> with<00:05:12.090> other<00:05:12.330> social<00:05:12.600> sciences

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
a competitor with other social sciences

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.890 
a competitor with other social sciences
and<00:05:13.640> we're<00:05:14.640> often<00:05:15.090> trying<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.419> explain<00:05:15.720> the

and we're often trying to explain the

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.080 
and we're often trying to explain the
same<00:05:16.080> thing<00:05:16.190> but<00:05:17.190> just<00:05:17.460> with<00:05:17.669> different

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
same thing but just with different

same thing but just with different
