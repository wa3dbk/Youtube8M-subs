 they who take on this challenge so 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
 important to be on stage 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.030
 accompanying our artists 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.760
 I guess it will not have to be 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.340

 we have the ballet called copla 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.930
 juniors because as you already have said 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.360
 it is a fundamental piece that the dance 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.800
 is present in this program and more with 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.230
 children who are going to do it 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.510
 wonderfully well and you imagine 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.510
 when we got down to work 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.520
 look for children of Andalusia who 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.800
 they will listen to defend us, of course, what 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.150
 we did because we did not see it clearly that if 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.310
 the language the image is worth more than a thousand 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.550
 words come perfect teacher is 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.550
 Over there 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.740
 let's start assembling a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.499
 choreography of a couplet called 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.659
 early morning lemon it is a very rumba 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:07.729
 facilitates and in which we will all be able to 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.110
 improvise in the second part and the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.210
 first part that I'm going to assemble the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 are you ready 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 keep going is in my test 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.400
 It was a dark pink with the lips of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.400
 heart 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 and very much I remember having a 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.290
 215 written in my notebook where you're going 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.080
 to give then look more than anything to dance 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.100
 they all danced beautifully 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.930
 it was simply that the coordination 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:01.580
 out fast, they will catch 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.350
 because there are 15 contestants who 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.530
 we have here almost everything 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.000
 accompanying they are going to go changing they always go 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 to change, they will change each 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.520
 week exactly every week we go to 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.950

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.709
 come in charge of them well then 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.709
 everyone knows that then the dance 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.420
 it will be an added incentive in the junior 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.490
 because we dance and accompany our 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.610
 fantastic artist and you also 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.080
 apart from preparing the dance corps 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.610
 you will also take care of the sunsets 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.260
 in scenes of our contestants and 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.120
 I will be in charge of them giving him 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.220
 we have already started with the dance class 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.810
 of coordination of body expression 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.090
 which is very important 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.310
 know them in the land where 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.590
 they were playing and we're having it 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:52.819
 well and little by little today at the end 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.349
 we had a great time all this has 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.540
 to prepare that inside nothing has 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.160
 to be the scenario is achieved so 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.959
