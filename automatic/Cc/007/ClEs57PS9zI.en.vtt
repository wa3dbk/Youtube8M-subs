obviously<00:00:55.860> these<00:00:56.430> guys<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.210> flying

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
obviously these guys are just flying

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
obviously these guys are just flying
down<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> side<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> mountain<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.670> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
down the side of the mountain but it's

foot so you know so a lot of guys are

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.289 
foot so you know so a lot of guys are
probably<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> lift<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.799> ski<00:01:05.430> lift

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
probably use this as a lift at ski lift

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.030 
probably use this as a lift at ski lift
access<00:01:06.689> ski<00:01:06.960> snow<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.830> back

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
access ski snow so they can get back

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520 
access ski snow so they can get back
down<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.400> chair<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.689> functions<00:01:10.200> very

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
down to the chair but it functions very

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.670 
down to the chair but it functions very
well<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.860> correct<00:01:11.189> absolutely<00:01:12.030> okay<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.840> step

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
well on correct absolutely okay and step

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.039 
well on correct absolutely okay and step
down<00:01:13.830> sidewall<00:01:14.340> step<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.180> side<00:01:15.479> wall<00:01:15.750> again

we've<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> wood<00:01:22.350> core<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:23.400> something

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
we've got a wood core with something

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
we've got a wood core with something
that's<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.270> unique<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.170> think<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.680> cool

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that's really unique and I think is cool

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.300 
that's really unique and I think is cool
that<00:01:26.070> atomic<00:01:26.100> did<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> year<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
that atomic did this year is the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
that atomic did this year is the
sprocket<00:01:29.310> power<00:01:29.549> boosters<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.780> too<00:01:31.409> in

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
sprocket power boosters that's too in

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
sprocket power boosters that's too in
this<00:01:32.100> case<00:01:32.310> titanium<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.900> strips<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this case titanium like strips that are

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
this case titanium like strips that are
actually<00:01:34.979> inlaid<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> core<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.720> in

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
actually inlaid into the core here in

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually inlaid into the core here in
the<00:01:37.320> tip<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> tail<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.369> mean<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.360> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the tip and the tail I mean this is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.670 
the tip and the tail I mean this is
different<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> times

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
different because a lot of times

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
different because a lot of times
manufacturers<00:01:41.610> they<00:01:41.850> stack<00:01:42.210> stuff<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.630> top<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
manufacturers they stack stuff on top of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020 
manufacturers they stack stuff on top of
the<00:01:42.990> ski<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> adds<00:01:43.560> weight<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.490> guys<00:01:44.670> find<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the ski it adds weight you guys find a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
the ski it adds weight you guys find a
way<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> cut<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.780> weight<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.439> add

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
way to cut down on weight but add

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.469 
way to cut down on weight but add
stability<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.460> absolutely<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.420> that's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
stability right absolutely and that's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.600 
stability right absolutely and that's
what<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> whole<00:01:49.079> sprocket<00:01:49.860> power<00:01:50.040> boosters

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
what the whole sprocket power boosters

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
something that would give some stability

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.789
