it turns any liquid into an odorless
safe<00:00:55.980> solid<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.699> 20<00:00:57.059> seconds<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
safe solid in about 20 seconds so this

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920

doesn't matter really when you release
the<00:01:02.340> crystals<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the crystals now you can do it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
the crystals now you can do it
beforehand<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.559> after<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.119> show<00:01:06.240> an
