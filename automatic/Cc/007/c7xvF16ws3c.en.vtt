night nights on One Night Wars right
here<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.649> talked<00:00:50.280> about<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.850> video

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
here I talked about in that one video

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
here I talked about in that one video
you<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.570> video<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.410> rise<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you in the first video the rise of the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
you in the first video the rise of the
war<00:00:53.280> begins<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> rise<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.329> nitro<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:55.140> right
