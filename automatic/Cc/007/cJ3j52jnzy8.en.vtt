I<00:03:30.540> don't<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.959> worry<00:03:31.109> about<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.380> because

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
I don't have to worry about it because

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.210 
I don't have to worry about it because
it<00:03:31.980> dies<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.260> three<00:03:34.950> or<00:03:35.190> four

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
it dies so it's like three or four

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.960 
it dies so it's like three or four
against<00:03:35.940> three<00:03:36.260> right<00:03:37.260> now<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.730> pretty

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
against three right now it's a pretty

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.110 
against three right now it's a pretty
close<00:03:39.239> game<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.160> yeah<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.220> go<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.670> wild<00:03:41.940> chase

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
close game and yeah I go to a wild chase

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.509 
close game and yeah I go to a wild chase
because<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.959> could<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.799> turn<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.250> shit

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
because it could you turn and shit

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.659 
because it could you turn and shit
because<00:03:44.819> it's<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.060> wild<00:03:45.359> chase<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:47.040> could

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
because it's a wild chase and I could

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.190 
because it's a wild chase and I could
have<00:03:47.760> used<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.060> fire<00:03:48.269> punch<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.870> knew<00:03:49.079> it

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
have used the fire punch but I knew it

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.960 
have used the fire punch but I knew it
wasn't<00:03:49.380> gonna<00:03:49.560> kill<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.310> bet<00:03:50.519> he<00:03:50.609> might

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
wasn't gonna kill and I bet he might

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.030 
wasn't gonna kill and I bet he might
want<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.269> use<00:03:51.359> earthquake<00:03:51.989> but<00:03:52.620> he<00:03:52.739> goes<00:03:52.859> for

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
want to use earthquake but he goes for

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.710 
want to use earthquake but he goes for
the<00:03:53.099> pursuit<00:03:53.519> which<00:03:53.730> doesn't<00:03:54.060> really<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.450> she

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the pursuit which doesn't really do she

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.409 
the pursuit which doesn't really do she
is<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.079> don't<00:03:55.290> mind<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.269> go

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
is so I don't mind that and I just go

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.270 
is so I don't mind that and I just go
out<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.720> scar<00:03:58.019> which<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.620> said<00:03:58.650> call<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
out to scar which like I said call the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 
out to scar which like I said call the
fuck<00:03:59.700> out<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.060> guy<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.109> go<00:04:01.380> for<00:04:01.560> the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
fuck out of that guy and go for the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.409 
fuck out of that guy and go for the
roost<00:04:01.859> just<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.549> case<00:04:02.700> he<00:04:02.910> might<00:04:03.120> want<00:04:03.269> to

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
roost just in case he might want to

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.140 
roost just in case he might want to
explode<00:04:04.010> which<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.130> what<00:04:05.340> he<00:04:05.430> does<00:04:05.639> that's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
explode which is what he does that's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.170 
explode which is what he does that's
pretty<00:04:06.450> good<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.859> three<00:04:08.370> against<00:04:08.639> two<00:04:08.730> right

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
pretty good so three against two right

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.349 
pretty good so three against two right
now<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:10.040> practically<00:04:11.040> two<00:04:11.519> against<00:04:11.940> two<00:04:12.000> now

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
now and practically two against two now

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.620 
now and practically two against two now
since<00:04:13.250> yeah<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.280> don't<00:04:14.489> want<00:04:14.760> anything<00:04:15.120> else<00:04:15.450> to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
since yeah I don't want anything else to

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.680 
since yeah I don't want anything else to
take<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:17.130> flamethrowers<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.299> decide

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
take the flamethrowers so I just decide

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.740 
take the flamethrowers so I just decide
to<00:04:18.720> leave<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.200> guy<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.940> rural<00:04:21.359> areas

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
to leave that guy in so I rural areas

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.469 
to leave that guy in so I rural areas
which<00:04:22.109> could<00:04:22.320> out<00:04:22.469> speed<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.190> now<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.300> to

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
which could out speed and now I get to

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.379 
which could out speed and now I get to
kill<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.990> thing<00:04:25.050> so

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
kill that thing so

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.510 
kill that thing so
I<00:04:26.449> was<00:04:27.379> really<00:04:27.590> hoping<00:04:27.710> he<00:04:28.099> didn't<00:04:28.400> have<00:04:28.490> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
I was really hoping he didn't have a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.700 
I was really hoping he didn't have a
scissor<00:04:28.939> cuz<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.900> would<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.439> would<00:04:30.499> have

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
scissor cuz that would that would have

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.689 
scissor cuz that would that would have
been<00:04:30.830> gay<00:04:31.099> for<00:04:31.129> me<00:04:31.460> but<00:04:31.999> he<00:04:32.210> has<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.360> Flygon<00:04:33.699> so

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
been gay for me but he has a Flygon so

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.159 
been gay for me but he has a Flygon so
I'm<00:04:35.659> not<00:04:35.719> entirely<00:04:36.439> too<00:04:36.919> sure<00:04:37.189> what<00:04:37.669> um<00:04:38.169> garage

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
I'm not entirely too sure what um garage

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.080 
I'm not entirely too sure what um garage
he<00:04:39.379> can<00:04:39.560> take<00:04:39.830> since<00:04:40.099> I<00:04:40.249> don't<00:04:40.490> really<00:04:40.669> use<00:04:40.939> it

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
he can take since I don't really use it

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.869 
he can take since I don't really use it
that<00:04:41.270> often<00:04:41.680> but<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:42.740> have<00:04:43.069> no<00:04:43.249> choice<00:04:43.279> but<00:04:43.550> to

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
that often but I have no choice but to

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.640 
that often but I have no choice but to
go<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.419> try<00:04:44.629> to<00:04:44.689> flinch<00:04:45.050> stuff<00:04:45.379> but

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
go to it and try to flinch stuff but

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.300 
go to it and try to flinch stuff but
he's<00:04:45.800> faster<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:47.439> yeah<00:04:48.439> I<00:04:48.469> didn't<00:04:48.949> really<00:04:49.069> know

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
he's faster so yeah I didn't really know

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.369 
he's faster so yeah I didn't really know
that<00:04:49.520> either<00:04:49.729> but<00:04:50.090> whatever<00:04:50.539> i<00:04:50.689> guess<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:51.020> I

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
that either but whatever i guess like I

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.800 
that either but whatever i guess like I
was<00:04:51.499> pretty<00:04:51.680> fast<00:04:52.009> and<00:04:52.279> that<00:04:52.550> is<00:04:52.819> exactly<00:04:53.060> what

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
was pretty fast and that is exactly what

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.619 
was pretty fast and that is exactly what
I<00:04:53.840> don't<00:04:54.259> use<00:04:54.499> flag<00:04:54.860> on<00:04:55.069> it<00:04:55.279> might<00:04:55.909> be<00:04:56.090> fast<00:04:56.419> and

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
I don't use flag on it might be fast and

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.600 
I don't use flag on it might be fast and
it<00:04:56.779> might<00:04:56.990> be<00:04:57.169> able<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.439> turn<00:04:57.860> but<00:04:58.099> it's<00:04:58.279> really

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
it might be able to turn but it's really

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360 
it might be able to turn but it's really
fucking<00:04:59.150> week<00:04:59.389> so<00:05:00.199> that<00:05:00.800> was<00:05:00.919> pretty<00:05:01.099> close
