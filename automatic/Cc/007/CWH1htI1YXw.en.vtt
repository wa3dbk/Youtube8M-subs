00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's kind of like maybe they should have

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.120 
it's kind of like maybe they should have
changed<00:02:11.750> those<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.200> make<00:02:12.350> those<00:02:12.590> sync<00:02:12.950> with

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
changed those to make those sync with

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.560 
changed those to make those sync with
the<00:02:13.220> walking<00:02:13.580> dead<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.120> sort<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.420> like

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
the walking dead but it's sort of like

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
know you kind of wouldn't want to change

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.250 
know you kind of wouldn't want to change
those<00:02:25.820> let's<00:02:26.120> see<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.420> railways<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:27.110> been

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
those let's see the railways have been

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.650 
those let's see the railways have been
changed<00:02:27.680> though<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:29.270> know<00:02:29.390> all<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
changed though and you know all the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.420 
changed though and you know all the
different<00:02:29.750> different<00:02:30.530> pieces<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.860> properties

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
different different pieces of properties

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.880 
different different pieces of properties
so<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:32.090> do<00:02:32.480> think<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.110> pretty<00:02:33.560> much

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
so I do think it is pretty much

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.740 
so I do think it is pretty much
primarily<00:02:34.190> based<00:02:34.760> off<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.150> comic<00:02:35.540> book

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
primarily based off the comic book

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.380 
primarily based off the comic book
series<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:37.070> course<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.430> TV<00:02:37.700> series<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.180> based

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
series of course the TV series is based

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.640 
series of course the TV series is based
on<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.630> comic<00:02:38.840> book<00:02:38.930> series<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.470> course

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
on the comic book series so of course

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.680 
on the comic book series so of course
you<00:02:40.220> know<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.459> kind<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.670> applies<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.180> both<00:02:41.360> but

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
you know it kind of applies to both but

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
you know it kind of applies to both but
the<00:02:42.019> communities<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.040> example<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
the communities like for example the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
the communities like for example the
hilltop<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.209> something<00:02:44.570> we<00:02:44.660> haven't<00:02:44.780> seen<00:02:44.989> in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
hilltop is something we haven't seen in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.199 
hilltop is something we haven't seen in
the<00:02:45.140> TV<00:02:45.500> series<00:02:45.799> yet<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.459> it's<00:02:46.640> kind<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> like

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
the TV series yet so it's kind of like

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.430 
the TV series yet so it's kind of like

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
more I would say geared towards the the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.350 
more I would say geared towards the the
comic<00:02:51.799> book<00:02:51.950> series<00:02:52.100> now<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.880> being<00:02:53.060> said<00:02:53.150> I

monopoly<00:04:20.920> and<00:04:21.040> risk<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.519> think<00:04:22.210> there<00:04:22.330> are

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
monopoly and risk I think there are

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360 
monopoly and risk I think there are
going<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.570> be<00:04:22.660> about<00:04:22.840> 50<00:04:23.230> bucks<00:04:23.500> each<00:04:23.710> supposed

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
going to be about 50 bucks each supposed

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.300 
going to be about 50 bucks each supposed
to<00:04:24.550> be<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:24.970> maybe<00:04:25.210> 50<00:04:25.600> or<00:04:25.720> 60<00:04:26.080> which<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.130> mean

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
to be so maybe 50 or 60 which I mean

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.500 
to be so maybe 50 or 60 which I mean
that<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.490> think<00:04:27.580> that's<00:04:27.790> pretty<00:04:27.970> standard<00:04:28.390> for

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
that I think that's pretty standard for

that I think that's pretty standard for
what<00:04:28.630> you're<00:04:28.780> looking<00:04:28.810> at<00:04:29.140> for<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:30.490> know

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
defending and these types of things then

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.120 
defending and these types of things then
of<00:05:21.810> course<00:05:22.020> you<00:05:22.110> have<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.259> different<00:05:22.650> chip

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
of course you have a different chip

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.120 
of course you have a different chip
pieces<00:05:23.490> different<00:05:23.669> colors<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:25.130> different

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
pieces different colors and different

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.890 
pieces different colors and different
different<00:05:26.729> cards<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.210> although<00:05:27.479> with<00:05:27.630> risk

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
different cards and although with risk

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.249 
different cards and although with risk
so<00:05:28.590> just<00:05:29.190> like<00:05:29.310> monopoly<00:05:29.550> pretty<00:05:30.419> cool<00:05:33.259> and

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
so just like monopoly pretty cool and
