00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.860
 Hello "Nita in Kitchen". 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.580
 Today we are going to make "Vanilla Ice Cream". 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.160
 Who does not like ice cream or old age 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.700
 Everyone very much appreciates. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.220
 Ice cream fanatics, it is cold or rainy 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.320
 Every season it lifts. 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.200
 So let's make Vanilla ice cream. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.100
 To make vanilla ice cream we need: 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.060
 1½ liters of cream (1½) milk, 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.640
 200 g sugar, 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.500
 200 g cream, 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.740
 Here we have taken home made cream 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.020
 If you also want to make cream at home 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.820
 So you can watch the video of my cream. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.660
 4 teaspoons cornflour, 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.280
 2 teaspoons Milk Powder, 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.980
 ½ teaspoon baking powder, 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.140
 ½ teaspoon stabilizer, 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.080
 ½ teaspoon Liquid Glucose, 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.060
 And 1 teaspoon vanilla essence, 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.120
 First of all, we will keep milk for boiling. 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.640
 Before boiling the milk we will take a little bit of milk 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.800
 Because with cold milk we will crack cornflour 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.760
 For flushing cornflower 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.140
 We have already taken out a lot of cold milk here. 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.940
 Now we will take this until our 1½ liters (1½) milk 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.500
 We will boil it until it is done 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.820
 And in between - keep running in the middle. 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.180
 We will get some sugar in the stabilizer. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.220
 And now we will put this sugar in boiling milk. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 After adding sugar, we will continue to milk 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.720
 So that our sugars do not fall on the bottom 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.540
 Now because our milk is hot 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.660
 So now we will take a little milk 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.400
 Because the lukewarm milk will help us get rid of milk powder. 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.080
 Now our milk has boiled to one liter. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.800
 Now we will put milk powder in it. 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.440
 For the milk powder we have brought here the milk 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.420
 Now look, it has become lukewarm. 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.380
 Now we will smash milk powder in this lukewarm milk. 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 Now see Milk Powder has dissolved in milk thoroughly. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.820
 And there is no knot in it 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.940
 Now we will put this milk powder in milk 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.780
 And run it. 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.880
 Now we will put Liquid Glucose in it. 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.700
 Then we will put a stabilizer in it. 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.320
 We had mixed sugar in the stabilizer earlier. 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.000
 Now the cold milk we had brought 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.820
 In it we will mix cornflour well 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.080
 We will see that there is no lump in it. 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.500
 See how well this dissolves. 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.520
 Now we will put it in boiling milk too. 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.460
 And run it 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.640
 Now after pouring cornflour, we are now in boiling milk 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.760
 Put baking powder and mix it well. 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.080
 Now after getting it well we will close the gas. 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.600
 Now all the things we have got in it well. 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.500
 Now we will close the gas and let it cool down. 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.580
 The milk has now cooled down, we will now take it out in a vessel. 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.820
 Now our ice cream base is ready. 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.900
 Now we will keep it freezing in the freezer until it's smoked. 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.760
 And when the semolina solids gets frozen then we add cream 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.620
 And put the vanilla essence and beat it. 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.640
 After a while we will now see 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.660
 Our ice cream semicolid has solidified. 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.420
 Now we are in 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.520
 Cream 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.420
 And add 1 teaspoon vanilla essence. 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.440
 Now we have added cream and vanilla essence in it. 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.960
 Now we will beat it with the help of a bitter. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.820
 We are using electric beater here 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.540
 If you do not have an electric bitter 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.460
 You can also use handbags 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.380
 Either the mixer can also be used. 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.020
 So let's beat it for a while 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.440
 We beat it 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.140
 Now we will put it in the freezer to be set 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.900
 Our ice cream is set now 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.560
 So let us take it out in the serving bowl. 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.520
 We have removed 3 scoops of this ice cream. 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.500
 Now to make it more interesting and testistic 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.760
 We will put chocolate syrup on it. 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.480
 This chocolate syrup we made in the house 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060
 If you want to make chocolate syrup in the house 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.680
 So you can video my chocolate syrup. 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.880
 Do not look yammy 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.860
 Now our delicious vanilla ice cream is ready. 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.880
