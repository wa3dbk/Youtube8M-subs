when<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.050> not<00:00:01.230> teaching<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.860> like<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.639> build

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
when I'm not teaching I like to build

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.590 
when I'm not teaching I like to build
houses<00:00:04.339> other<00:00:05.339> fun<00:00:05.640> things<00:00:05.910> like<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.150> and

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
houses other fun things like that and

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.780 
houses other fun things like that and
I've<00:00:06.750> got<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.020> little<00:00:07.830> jack<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.460> called<00:00:08.700> a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
I've got a little jack it's called a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850 
I've got a little jack it's called a
bottle<00:00:09.150> Jack<00:00:09.450> because<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.380> kind<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.650> shaped

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
bottle Jack because it's kind of shaped

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.079 
bottle Jack because it's kind of shaped
like<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> bottle<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:13.070> I've<00:00:14.070> used<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.759> bottle

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
like a bottle and I've used this bottle

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.400 
like a bottle and I've used this bottle
jack<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.599> fact<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.619> lift<00:00:17.279> up<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.900> section

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
jack in fact to lift up a good section

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.450 
jack in fact to lift up a good section
of<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.800> house<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.000> idea<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.420> there's<00:00:21.720> this

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
of a house so the idea is there's this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.179 
of a house so the idea is there's this
there's<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.609> part<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.769> come<00:00:26.070> out

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
there's this part here that can come out

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
there's this part here that can come out
of<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> bottle<00:00:27.840> Jack<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.470> if<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.970> back

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
of the bottle Jack and if you go back

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.310 
of the bottle Jack and if you go back
and<00:00:30.869> forth<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.489> pump<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.320> hydraulic

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and forth with this you pump a hydraulic

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
and forth with this you pump a hydraulic
fluid<00:00:34.770> some<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> oil<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
fluid some kind of oil in here and it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.010 
fluid some kind of oil in here and it
causes<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.469> piston<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.910> move<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.660> then

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
causes this piston to move up and then

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
causes this piston to move up and then
if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> put<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> house<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.190> let's<00:00:41.730> say

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
if you put a house up here let's say

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
if you put a house up here let's say
it's<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> red<00:00:42.660> house<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> scale

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it's a red house this is not to scale

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.220 
it's a red house this is not to scale
but<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:45.930> lift<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.770> house<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
but you can then lift up the house and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.569 
but you can then lift up the house and
you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.680> something<00:00:49.950> underneath<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.430> or

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you know put something underneath it or

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.619 
you know put something underneath it or
something<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> don't<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.090> why<00:00:51.210> you'd<00:00:51.360> need<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
something I don't know why you'd need to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
something I don't know why you'd need to
lift<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> house<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.350> sometimes<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.010> so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
lift up a house but sometimes you do so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.430 
lift up a house but sometimes you do so
this<00:00:54.180> bottle<00:00:54.480> Jack<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.780> lift<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.110> entire

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this bottle Jack can lift up the entire

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
this bottle Jack can lift up the entire
house<00:00:55.710> although<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.820> move<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.510> my

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
house although I can move this with my

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
house although I can move this with my
hand<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.070> something<00:00:59.370> cool<00:00:59.579> with

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
hand was it something cool with

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.840 
hand was it something cool with
mechanical<00:01:00.420> advantage<00:01:02.629> yeah<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.610> reason

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
mechanical advantage yeah the reason

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
mechanical advantage yeah the reason
that<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> mechanical<00:01:06.990> advantage<00:01:07.049> here

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that we get a mechanical advantage here

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
that we get a mechanical advantage here
comes<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.400> fluids<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.240> I'd<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
comes from fluids so I'd like to kind of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140 
comes from fluids so I'd like to kind of
draw<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> schematic<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> bottle<00:01:11.460> Jack<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
draw a schematic of the bottle Jack the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
draw a schematic of the bottle Jack the
idea<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.869> we've<00:01:13.830> got<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.490> tube<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.780> some

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
idea is that we've got a tube of some

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
idea is that we've got a tube of some
fluid<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:18.060> case<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.720> oil

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
fluid in our case it's going to be oil

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.850 
fluid in our case it's going to be oil
and<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:20.130> tube<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:20.640> narrow<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.960> but

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and the tube is very narrow here but

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
and the tube is very narrow here but
over<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> side<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:24.060> freaky<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
over on this side it's freaky and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
over on this side it's freaky and
enormous<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.030> enable<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> lift<00:01:27.689> up

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
enormous this one enable you to lift up

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.819 
enormous this one enable you to lift up
cars<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.680> stuff<00:01:28.860> also<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.530> let's<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.650> I'm

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
cars and stuff also so let's see I'm

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.859 
cars and stuff also so let's see I'm
going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> write<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> Pistons<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> blue<00:01:33.630> so

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
going to write the Pistons as a blue so

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.539 
going to write the Pistons as a blue so
that<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.590> they'll<00:01:34.770> maybe<00:01:35.340> be

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that you can see that they'll maybe be

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.020 
that you can see that they'll maybe be
able<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.970> move<00:01:36.270> here's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> piston<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.909> we

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
able to move here's a piston that we

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.319 
able to move here's a piston that we
could<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.390> over<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.960> side<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:41.270> here's<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
could put over on this side and here's a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.389 
could put over on this side and here's a
piston<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.990> could<00:01:43.110> put<00:01:43.320> over<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
piston that we could put over on this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.350 
piston that we could put over on this
side<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:46.079> sucker<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.740> able<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
side and that sucker will be able to

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.810 
side and that sucker will be able to
suck<00:01:48.360> we'll<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.600> able<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.820> if

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
suck we'll be able to go up and down if

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510 
suck we'll be able to go up and down if
we<00:01:50.970> push<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.930> down<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.220> one

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we push on this one down then that one

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.069 
we push on this one down then that one
will<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.240> push<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.869> down

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
will go up if we push on that one down

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
will go up if we push on that one down
then<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.250> I'd<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
then this one will go up and I'd like to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.249 
then this one will go up and I'd like to
kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> investigate<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.750> pressures<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
kind of investigate the pressures of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.679 
kind of investigate the pressures of
these<00:01:58.500> things<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.070> notice<00:01:59.610> first<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
these things let's notice first that the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.649 
these things let's notice first that the
area<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:02.009> side<00:02:02.399> we'll<00:02:02.850> call<00:02:03.030> an<00:02:03.119> area<00:02:03.390> one

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
area of this side we'll call an area one

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.770 
area of this side we'll call an area one
is<00:02:03.960> much<00:02:04.590> much<00:02:04.979> much<00:02:05.399> smaller<00:02:05.820> than<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> area

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is much much much smaller than the area

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540 
is much much much smaller than the area
of<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.200> side<00:02:07.439> which<00:02:07.590> we'll<00:02:07.740> call<00:02:07.890> area<00:02:08.310> two

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
of this side which we'll call area two

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.630 
of this side which we'll call area two
so<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.450> go

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
so here we go

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.720 
so here we go
area<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.780> much<00:02:11.080> smaller<00:02:11.350> than<00:02:11.620> area<00:02:12.490> two

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
area one is much smaller than area two

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.030 
area one is much smaller than area two
and<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.630> some<00:02:13.810> equations<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.770> here

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and we can get some equations going here

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.970 
and we can get some equations going here
if<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.610> thing<00:02:15.970> moves<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.780> little<00:02:17.050> bit<00:02:17.380> we<00:02:17.860> can

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
if this thing moves a little bit we can

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.640 
if this thing moves a little bit we can
call<00:02:18.250> its<00:02:18.490> motion<00:02:19.060> d1<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.200> moved<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
call its motion d1 that moved the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.370 
call its motion d1 that moved the
distance<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.250> moved<00:02:21.900> down<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.230> then

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
distance that it's moved down and then

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.620 
distance that it's moved down and then
this<00:02:23.530> one<00:02:23.770> will<00:02:23.950> move<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.880> tiny<00:02:25.090> bit<00:02:25.360> up

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
this one will move just a tiny bit up

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.070 
this one will move just a tiny bit up
and<00:02:25.930> that'll<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.670> d2<00:02:27.670> I'm<00:02:28.210> sort<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.600> implying

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
and that'll be d2 I'm sort of implying

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.020 
and that'll be d2 I'm sort of implying
that<00:02:29.290> these<00:02:29.500> aren't<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.100> same<00:02:30.310> distance<00:02:30.820> is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
that these aren't the same distance is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.770 
that these aren't the same distance is
that<00:02:31.210> reasonable

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
that reasonable

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.490 
that reasonable
you<00:02:32.080> know<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.950> volume<00:02:33.250> must<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:34.030> conserved

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you know that volume must be conserved

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.150 
you know that volume must be conserved
if<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.100> incompressible<00:02:37.030> fluid<00:02:41.160> then

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
if this is an incompressible fluid then

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.330 
if this is an incompressible fluid then
we<00:02:42.280> know<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.459> volume<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.720> conserved<00:02:44.470> for

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
we know that volume is conserved for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.740 
we know that volume is conserved for
incompressible<00:02:45.850> fluids

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
incompressible fluids

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.470 
incompressible fluids
sorry<00:02:47.739> that's<00:02:47.920> two<00:02:48.190> words<00:02:48.370> their<00:02:48.670> volume<00:02:49.330> must

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
sorry that's two words their volume must

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.890 
sorry that's two words their volume must
be<00:02:49.660> conserved<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.459> change<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.180> volume<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
be conserved so the change in volume of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.870 
be conserved so the change in volume of
side<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.739> equal<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> change<00:02:54.550> in

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
side one is equal to the change in

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
side one is equal to the change in
volume<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.390> side<00:02:55.930> two

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
volume of side two

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.670 
volume of side two
so<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.880> side<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.870> I'm<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.080> talking<00:02:59.590> about

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
so if side one I'm just talking about

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.560 
so if side one I'm just talking about
magnitudes<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:00.700> going<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> area

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
magnitudes this is going to be the area

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.170 
magnitudes this is going to be the area
of<00:03:01.810> side<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.530> times<00:03:03.010> how<00:03:03.310> far<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.880> has<00:03:04.060> gone

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
of side one times how far it has gone

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.120 
of side one times how far it has gone
and<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.840> going<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.020> be<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.230> area<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.800> side

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
and this is going to be the area of side

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.050 
and this is going to be the area of side
two<00:03:06.400> times<00:03:07.000> how<00:03:07.360> far<00:03:07.690> side<00:03:08.410> two<00:03:08.800> has<00:03:09.340> gone<00:03:09.820> of

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
two times how far side two has gone of

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.530 
two times how far side two has gone of
course<00:03:10.090> that's<00:03:10.480> volume<00:03:11.050> for<00:03:11.620> these<00:03:11.770> cylinders

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
course that's volume for these cylinders

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.080 
course that's volume for these cylinders
so<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.900> solve<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.530> for<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.670> distance

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so we can solve this for the distance

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.180 
so we can solve this for the distance
let's<00:03:16.360> solve<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.810> for<00:03:17.049> distance<00:03:17.799> one<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
let's solve it for distance one the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.770 
let's solve it for distance one the
distance<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.880> piston<00:03:19.269> needs<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.630> move

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
distance that this piston needs to move

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.300 
distance that this piston needs to move
to<00:03:19.989> make<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.320> piston<00:03:20.709> move<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.950> little<00:03:21.070> bit

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
to make that piston move a little bit

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.850 
to make that piston move a little bit
well<00:03:21.640> it'll<00:03:21.910> be<00:03:22.000> something<00:03:22.360> times<00:03:23.140> d2<00:03:23.440> and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
well it'll be something times d2 and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.330 
well it'll be something times d2 and
that<00:03:24.070> d2<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:25.890> coefficient<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.010> a2<00:03:27.690> over<00:03:28.690> a1

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
that d2 that coefficient is a2 over a1

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550 
that d2 that coefficient is a2 over a1
notice<00:03:30.340> a2<00:03:30.549> over<00:03:30.880> a1<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.570> enormous

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
notice a2 over a1 is this enormous

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.800 
notice a2 over a1 is this enormous
number<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.430> order<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.730> move<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:34.299> piston

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
number so in order to move this piston

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.479 
number so in order to move this piston
just<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.200> tiny<00:03:35.440> bit<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.860> need<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.190> move<00:03:36.280> this

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
just a tiny bit you need to move this

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.820 
just a tiny bit you need to move this
piston<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.970> ton<00:03:37.299> but<00:03:37.750> what's<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.140> point<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.709> all

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
piston a ton but what's the point of all

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:48.620 
piston a ton but what's the point of all
this<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.760> point<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:43.350> point<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.250> force

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.780 

hugely<00:03:49.920> bigger<00:03:51.269> where<00:03:53.070> where<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.489> force

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
hugely bigger where where is the force

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.550 
hugely bigger where where is the force
hugely<00:03:55.720> bigger<00:03:56.560> which<00:03:56.890> side<00:03:57.989> pause

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.550 

okay<00:04:03.370> you're<00:04:03.850> thinking<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.020> force<00:04:05.319> is

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
okay you're thinking that the force is

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.809 
okay you're thinking that the force is
hugely<00:04:06.130> bigger<00:04:06.490> on<00:04:07.350> this<00:04:08.350> side<00:04:08.950> because<00:04:09.250> the

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
hugely bigger on this side because the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.449 
hugely bigger on this side because the
pressures<00:04:10.480> are<00:04:10.810> equal<00:04:12.750> p1<00:04:13.750> equals<00:04:14.560> p2<00:04:14.950> because

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
pressures are equal p1 equals p2 because

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.190 
pressures are equal p1 equals p2 because
they're<00:04:15.790> both<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.209> same<00:04:16.239> fluid<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.049> they're

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
they're both the same fluid and they're

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.840 
they're both the same fluid and they're
at<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.590> same<00:04:17.859> height<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.370> we<00:04:18.400> don't<00:04:18.609> have<00:04:18.700> any

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
at the same height so we don't have any

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.270 
at the same height so we don't have any
Rho<00:04:19.090> gh<00:04:19.570> going<00:04:19.900> on<00:04:19.989> here<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.530> pressures<00:04:21.100> are

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
Rho gh going on here the pressures are

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.750 
Rho gh going on here the pressures are
equal<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:23.050> force<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.680> 1<00:04:24.040> times<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.610> area

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
equal so the force of 1 times the area

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.629 
equal so the force of 1 times the area
of<00:04:25.060> 1<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.510> equal<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.050> force<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.620> 2<00:04:27.040> times

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
of 1 is equal to the force of 2 times

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.820 
of 1 is equal to the force of 2 times
the<00:04:27.790> area<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:28.240> 2<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.080> if<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.320> were<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.500> solve

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
the area of 2 and if I were to solve

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.710 
the area of 2 and if I were to solve
this<00:04:30.040> for<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.370> force<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:30.880> 2<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.450> might<00:04:31.630> be

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
this for the force of 2 that might be

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.510 
this for the force of 2 that might be

the car that you're lifting up right the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.240 
the car that you're lifting up right the
force<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:34.000> 2<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.480> going<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> be<00:04:35.350> well<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:36.100> the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
enormous number because a to era 2 is

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.710 
enormous number because a to era 2 is
really<00:05:11.979> big<00:05:12.220> everyone's<00:05:12.880> really<00:05:13.060> small<00:05:13.390> look

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
really big everyone's really small look

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.600 
really big everyone's really small look
it's<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.050> same<00:05:14.260> ratio<00:05:14.680> is<00:05:14.830> here<00:05:15.070> look<00:05:15.520> at

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
it's the same ratio is here look at

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.520 
it's the same ratio is here look at
these<00:05:15.700> two<00:05:15.880> equations<00:05:16.000> they're<00:05:16.900> very<00:05:17.200> similar

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
these two equations they're very similar

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.680 
these two equations they're very similar
but<00:05:17.830> they're<00:05:18.280> kind<00:05:18.669> of<00:05:18.850> inverses<00:05:19.270> in<00:05:19.570> one

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
but they're kind of inverses in one

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.540 
but they're kind of inverses in one
another<00:05:19.930> now<00:05:20.350> look<00:05:20.590> you<00:05:20.950> know<00:05:21.100> what<00:05:21.310> force

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
another now look you know what force

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.480 
another now look you know what force
times<00:05:21.729> distance<00:05:21.970> is<00:05:22.300> why<00:05:22.660> that's<00:05:23.020> work<00:05:23.710> so

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
times distance is why that's work so

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.940 
times distance is why that's work so
assuming<00:05:25.060> no<00:05:25.240> friction<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:26.350> work<00:05:26.620> that<00:05:26.860> you

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
assuming no friction the work that you

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.159 
assuming no friction the work that you
do<00:05:27.130> pushing<00:05:27.520> this<00:05:27.700> one<00:05:27.910> down<00:05:28.090> is<00:05:28.390> equal<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.080> the

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
do pushing this one down is equal to the

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.920 
do pushing this one down is equal to the
work<00:05:29.289> that<00:05:29.350> you<00:05:29.530> do<00:05:29.650> pulling<00:05:30.039> that<00:05:30.220> one<00:05:30.430> up<00:05:30.900> aha

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
work that you do pulling that one up aha

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.850 
work that you do pulling that one up aha
which<00:05:32.590> implies<00:05:33.250> that<00:05:33.870> it's<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:35.169> machine<00:05:35.350> and

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
which implies that it's a machine and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.680 
which implies that it's a machine and
it's<00:05:36.070> efficiency<00:05:36.729> is<00:05:36.850> 1<00:05:37.120> now<00:05:37.390> of<00:05:37.510> course

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
it's efficiency is 1 now of course

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.050 
it's efficiency is 1 now of course
because<00:05:38.080> it's<00:05:38.500> viscosity<00:05:39.490> that's<00:05:39.760> gonna<00:05:39.910> be

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
because it's viscosity that's gonna be

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.700 
because it's viscosity that's gonna be
causing<00:05:40.510> a<00:05:40.570> little<00:05:40.690> bit<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:40.930> heating<00:05:41.350> up<00:05:41.470> there

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
causing a little bit of heating up there

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.710 
causing a little bit of heating up there
are<00:05:41.770> little<00:05:41.919> bits<00:05:42.160> of<00:05:42.400> this<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:43.000> interact<00:05:43.479> with

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
are little bits of this to interact with

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.210 
are little bits of this to interact with
the<00:05:43.840> surface<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:44.440> interact<00:05:44.710> with<00:05:44.860> each<00:05:44.979> other

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
the surface and interact with each other

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.560 
the surface and interact with each other
that<00:05:45.640> are<00:05:45.669> gonna<00:05:45.820> cause<00:05:46.030> it<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.240> heat<00:05:46.330> up<00:05:46.360> of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
that are gonna cause it to heat up of

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.909 
that are gonna cause it to heat up of
course<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:46.810> won't<00:05:46.870> be<00:05:46.990> perfectly<00:05:47.500> efficient

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
course it won't be perfectly efficient

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.590 
course it won't be perfectly efficient
but<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.580> can<00:05:48.760> see<00:05:48.910> that<00:05:49.090> there's<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.300> force

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
but you can see that there's a force

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.360 
but you can see that there's a force
times<00:05:49.840> distance<00:05:50.110> thing<00:05:50.470> going<00:05:50.710> on<00:05:50.830> here<00:05:51.070> so

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
times distance thing going on here so

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.490 
times distance thing going on here so
let's<00:05:51.400> summarize<00:05:52.030> this<00:05:52.419> in<00:05:52.600> just<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.140> moment

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
let's summarize this in just a moment

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.080 
let's summarize this in just a moment
and<00:05:53.590> just<00:05:53.740> uh<00:05:53.890> let's<00:05:54.220> try<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.430> be<00:05:54.580> clean<00:05:54.820> about

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
and just uh let's try to be clean about

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.570 
and just uh let's try to be clean about
this<00:05:55.300> I'm<00:05:55.780> saying<00:05:56.260> that<00:05:56.740> we<00:05:56.890> can<00:05:57.100> get<00:05:57.310> by

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
this I'm saying that we can get by

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.370 
this I'm saying that we can get by
pushing<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:58.090> small<00:05:58.479> force<00:05:58.810> right<00:05:59.020> here<00:05:59.200> we<00:05:59.260> can

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
pushing a small force right here we can

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.590 
pushing a small force right here we can
get<00:05:59.470> an<00:05:59.560> enormous<00:05:59.979> force<00:06:00.490> up<00:06:00.640> right<00:06:00.850> here<00:06:01.090> so<00:06:01.270> I

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
get an enormous force up right here so I

really<00:06:09.400> long<00:06:09.640> distance<00:06:10.090> so<00:06:10.479> it's<00:06:10.630> like<00:06:10.780> using

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
really long distance so it's like using

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.420 
really long distance so it's like using
that<00:06:11.409> winch<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:11.680> we've<00:06:11.890> got<00:06:12.010> in<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.190> back<00:06:12.310> of

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
that winch that we've got in the back of

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.560 
that winch that we've got in the back of
the<00:06:12.520> room<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:12.820> suppose<00:06:13.150> there<00:06:13.360> are<00:06:13.419> no

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
the room I suppose there are no

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.690 
the room I suppose there are no
surprises<00:06:13.870> about<00:06:14.080> that<00:06:14.550> but

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
surprises about that but

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.790 
surprises about that but
payback<00:06:16.180> is<00:06:16.210> this<00:06:16.900> distance<00:06:17.410> you<00:06:17.530> have<00:06:17.680> to

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
payback is this distance you have to

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.620 
payback is this distance you have to
push<00:06:17.950> the<00:06:18.130> distance<00:06:18.460> really<00:06:18.760> really<00:06:18.970> long<00:06:19.180> so

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
push the distance really really long so

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.850 
push the distance really really long so
there<00:06:20.530> we<00:06:20.680> are

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
there we are

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.340
