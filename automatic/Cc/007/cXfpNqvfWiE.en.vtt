okay<00:00:01.980> syncopation<00:00:02.639> what<00:00:03.210> it<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.449> let's<00:00:04.200> take<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
okay syncopation what it is let's take a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.510 
okay syncopation what it is let's take a
basic<00:00:04.740> example<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.640> for<00:00:06.210> natural<00:00:06.959> rhythm<00:00:07.589> four

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520 
basic example on for natural rhythm four

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.480 
basic example on for natural rhythm four
by<00:00:08.700> four<00:00:09.000> time<00:00:09.360> signature<00:00:09.889> for<00:00:10.889> beads<00:00:11.160> each

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
by four time signature for beads each

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.419 
by four time signature for beads each
measure<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.630> strong<00:00:13.170> beads<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.129> first

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
measure the strong beads are the first

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.030 
measure the strong beads are the first
and<00:00:14.670> third<00:00:15.000> bead<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.900> measure<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.530> play

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
and third bead of that measure I play

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.029 
and third bead of that measure I play
the<00:00:17.100> fifth<00:00:17.310> thing<00:00:17.520> open<00:00:17.939> one<00:00:18.680> dream<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:22.039> how

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
the fifth thing open one dream and how

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
the fifth thing open one dream and how
this<00:00:23.400> syncopate<00:00:24.349> okay<00:00:26.480> we<00:00:27.480> add<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:29.390> accent<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
this syncopate okay we add an accent to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.530 
this syncopate okay we add an accent to
somewhere<00:00:32.420> inside<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.690> natural<00:00:34.560> kind<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
somewhere inside this natural kind of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.840 
somewhere inside this natural kind of
strong<00:00:36.540> weak<00:00:37.080> beat<00:00:38.630> rule<00:00:39.630> we<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.700> then

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
strong weak beat rule we have and then

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.160 
strong weak beat rule we have and then
we<00:00:42.060> get<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.330> syncopated<00:00:43.110> rhythm<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:44.840> we<00:00:45.840> take

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
we get the syncopated rhythm or we take

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.690 
we get the syncopated rhythm or we take
the<00:00:46.740> accent<00:00:47.250> away<00:00:47.880> from<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:49.520> actual<00:00:51.470> strong

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
the accent away from the actual strong

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.590 
the accent away from the actual strong
beat<00:00:53.700> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.840> measure<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> best

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
beat of the measure I think the best

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500 
beat of the measure I think the best
play<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.500> i'll<00:00:58.680> show<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:58.980> example<00:00:59.670> let's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
play is that i'll show you example let's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.219 
play is that i'll show you example let's
play<00:01:00.750> again<00:01:00.900> those<00:01:01.940> coordinates<00:01:02.940> first<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
play again those coordinates first and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
play again those coordinates first and
third<00:01:04.260> beats<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.309> strong<00:01:05.640> beats<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
third beats are the strong beats of the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:19.220 
third beats are the strong beats of the
measure<00:01:07.020> 1<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:10.040> 10<00:01:15.860> let's<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:18.230> didn't

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
measure 1 to 10 let's now take I didn't

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.220 
measure 1 to 10 let's now take I didn't
play<00:01:19.410> much<00:01:19.740> accent<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.880> third<00:01:21.120> bead<00:01:21.420> but

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
play much accent to the third bead but

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.170 
play much accent to the third bead but
let's<00:01:22.500> make<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> rest<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> third<00:01:24.690> beat<00:01:25.160> we

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
let's make a rest to the third beat we

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.670 
let's make a rest to the third beat we
expect<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.480> third<00:01:27.870> beat<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.410> have<00:01:28.560> an

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
expect that the third beat will have an

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.570 
expect that the third beat will have an
old<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.010> two<00:01:29.880> three<00:01:31.130> one<00:01:32.130> two<00:01:32.159> three<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.659> two

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
old one two three one two three one two

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.480 
old one two three one two three one two
take<00:01:35.580> that<00:01:35.790> third<00:01:36.030> node<00:01:36.830> away<00:01:37.830> let's<00:01:38.280> take

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
take that third node away let's take

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
take that third node away let's take
that<00:01:38.730> X<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.330> way<00:01:39.480> so<00:01:40.230> we<00:01:40.260> play<00:01:40.680> quarter

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that X on the way so we play quarter

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.590 
that X on the way so we play quarter
mile<00:01:41.340> toh<00:01:41.550> me<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.940> first<00:01:42.180> second<00:01:42.510> or

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
mile toh me to the first second or

00:01:42.600 --> 00:02:05.960 
mile toh me to the first second or
fourth<00:01:42.930> beat<00:01:43.280> one<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:45.000> three<00:01:45.500> four

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.480 

now<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:08.259> feel<00:02:08.679> of<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.429> rhythm<00:02:10.200> itself<00:02:11.490> it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
now the feel of the rhythm itself it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.540 
now the feel of the rhythm itself it
changed<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.150> way<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:17.800> call<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.370> as

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
changed and in a way that we call it as

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.150 
changed and in a way that we call it as
a<00:02:18.580> single<00:02:19.120> patient<00:02:19.620> okay<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.900> took<00:02:23.440> one

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
a single patient okay now I took one

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.300 
a single patient okay now I took one
accent<00:02:24.730> away<00:02:25.180> from<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.720> natural<00:02:26.530> rhythm<00:02:27.100> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
accent away from that natural rhythm and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.010 
accent away from that natural rhythm and
that<00:02:27.750> made<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.959> syncopate<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.600> many

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
that made it syncopate but we have many

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.880 
that made it syncopate but we have many
ways<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.890> make<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.100> syncopations<00:02:34.890> offbeat

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
ways to make a syncopations offbeat

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.990 
ways to make a syncopations offbeat
single<00:02:36.640> patience<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:38.220> even<00:02:39.220> notice<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
single patience and even notice in the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.430 
single patience and even notice in the
patient's<00:02:41.730> suspensions<00:02:42.810> all<00:02:43.810> kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.200> ways

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
patient's suspensions all kind of ways

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.070 
patient's suspensions all kind of ways
to<00:02:44.770> make<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.190> rhythm<00:02:45.820> sound<00:02:46.630> more

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
to make the rhythm sound more

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.830 
to make the rhythm sound more
interesting<00:02:47.940> okay<00:02:48.940> let's<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> couple<00:02:49.630> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
interesting okay let's do a couple of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.280 
interesting okay let's do a couple of
more<00:02:50.110> exercises<00:02:50.680> next
