00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Come now where the holidays are every day 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 videos beautiful on it 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.319
 I do not believe that otherwise 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.990
 his laptop overheats and possibly him 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.889
 Report above 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.120
 rather , that is not the case 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.219
 I say mine if you have yourselves 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.089
 ask yourself answers then need 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.619
 I do not do anything anymore 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.420
 i just invite i just film 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.230
 still the postulate that makes so high then 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.230
 the job alone 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.689
 Well, what's up is running again alex 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 and get to faq friday bin curious 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.570
 whether the video actually this time 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 I will have a friday uploaded 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 I've definitely already 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.480
 thursday set that you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 take 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 So it remains exciting and completely new 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.360
 now for all people who are not facebook 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 and still on faq friday 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 I want to participate until now 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.910
 always just facebook ask questions 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.219
 you can now see this video 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.660
 ask your questions for the next faq 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 so now everyone has the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.510
 possibility also has its questions in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.430
 to bring faq 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 technically again black ops 1 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 because when I play black ops two gameplay 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.899
 The servers wanted to play 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.489
 primed all the time around and not 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.260
 thrown out of the server 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.699
 I could not separate him super 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.949
 That's why I have to play black ops 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 1 but unfortunately take a few gates 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.500
 much cashed through the whole 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.479
 Glare grenades and this shit but 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.150
 Nevertheless, some horny bodies are there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.210
 So it all feeds 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.390
 to look cool faq and go is because 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.119
 humor as black as the honda but 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.770
 One hundred percent have the family in 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.299
 your classmates actually little 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.650
 money or are they so stingy in themselves 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.909
 I have an interesting question 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 actually not thought about it 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.680
 but the degree of professionalism in the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.490
 that is pulled through leaves me on it 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.570
 close that over generations 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.009
 was therefore perfected his 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 origin probably somewhere in the world 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.420
 middle ages has what do you think of yours 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 enemies or was someone very eager 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.689
 first three questions in a row 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.979
 You also do live streaming 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.750
 so at some point if that is youtube 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.579
 money right I do not know what to do with it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.140
 I have to pay youtube money yes 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.399
 not for that can stream 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.990
 I have the question several times 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.700
 but answered this time with a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.780
 other answer than usual until now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.060
 I said no that's not mine 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.000
 internet is too bad but say 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.780
 quite unofficially there are those 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.729
 Tiny little teeny tiny possibility 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.890
 that get better internet 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.700
 could and as soon as that's the case start 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.789
 I with stream on 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.670
 the other two questions involve 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.590
 fascist honda jokes and how to 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.799
 long brings to freak you like before 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.969

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.969
 new vice lame 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.939
 I did not know the picture yet 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:34.129
 you already shit in the garden 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.540
 I dared but without shit 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:41.090
 a buddy of mine once has ins 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.579
 you are cracked on saturday 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.790
 also in oberhausen the project ypsilon 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.859
 words are guys oberhausen gas prices 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.230
 we at over 150 I ask you to 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.090
 vingst weekend you know what's going on 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.650
 on the streets or like my former 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.510
 Teacher would also say I ask you 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.739
 never gamble again or against the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.079
 mostly gambling with the 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.090
 worst line so exactly 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.400
 I've always taken that from anyway 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.169
 water the more a life reserve goes 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.760
 do you have special with women 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:11.510
 ideas or are you more flexible 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.939
 are you coming from the other bank? 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.299
 yes I come from the other shore of peter 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.889
 shore you can already live from youtube 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.540
 or do you want from youtube wm at all 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.879
 or do you rather want to go to school ? 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.530
 So concentrate and study etc 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.090
 study and so does not come in for me 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.650
 ask and at some point from youtube 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.470
 Being able to live would be cool though 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.190
 I am still light years away 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.519
 yours is what your parents are saying 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.519
 youtube 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:47.000
 well I'll be right after I have to 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:48.799
 what to cut again first time 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.109
 when changing tire helps it is clear 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.909
 yes I have just finished the video 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.620
 do 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:58.750
 but this youtube you chance this 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.209
 but no one is allowed to make film or only 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.500
 in question if i miss this time 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.930
 what are you doing the rest of your holidays 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.120
 Of course , I did not do anything 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.959
 Will you get black ops three? 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.329
 I think so 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.950
 and also asked what I have 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.269
 present under the game because I have 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.280
 not really what 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.900
 told 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.180
 So of course I hope that with it 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.889
 this futuristic convincing not too crass 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.240
 is not so as navi but 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.240
 rather a bit of classic black 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.470
 keep ops 2 or the old cod parts 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.880
 and yes, I think so 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.760
 get and also play a bit 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.169
 will do videos anyway and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.340
 Let's hope for the best, though 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.400
 Honestly, I'm just 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.590
 skeptical so I'm definitely 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.270
 not the hype or so I I asked 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.400
 every time why you are so disturbed but 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.610
 is there a mini to an answer 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.610
 thereon 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:00.130
 Do you like ice cream more fuel? 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 splashed the game plan next 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.669
 to treat more closely 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.160
 that depends on which one is sick first 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.770
 is given 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.730
 how did you find black ops 2 until now and 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.000
 are you ready with the same one? 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.080
 bus line 12 already very cool you so 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.940
 That's fun 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.070
 Now something new is new to me 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.300
 always makes fun mostly and 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.860
 continues with the same bus line 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.630
 yes logically i moved or something 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.830
 so 33 you are my husband how many subscriptions 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.460
 Do you want to at least one year? 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:34.510
 all get a line really like that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.100
 bad no she is worse last 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.960
 ask what do you have right after the 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.430
 final exams done first 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.960
 oh well we are with some colleagues at 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.610
 car from school to main station 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.960
 down on the way to first time 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.550
 the windows do not go down together 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.350
 roared at the window passers-by and 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.419
 Although about that would be through in this 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.740
 I hope you enjoyed the faq 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.479
