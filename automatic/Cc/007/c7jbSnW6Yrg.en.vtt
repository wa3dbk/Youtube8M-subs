back in time we needed to tailor

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.039 
back in time we needed to tailor
steampunk<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.190> our<00:00:56.790> world<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.480> opposed<00:00:57.900> to

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
steampunk to our world as opposed to

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.469 
steampunk to our world as opposed to
going<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.979> more<00:00:59.339> traditional<00:00:59.369> takes<00:01:00.269> on

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
going with the more traditional takes on

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.990 
going with the more traditional takes on
steampunk<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.440> were<00:01:01.589> usually<00:01:01.799> a<00:01:02.190> very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
steampunk which were usually a very

steampunk which were usually a very
Victorian<00:01:03.420> influenced<00:01:04.379> look<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.250> went<00:01:05.549> with

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Victorian influenced look we went with

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.170 
Victorian influenced look we went with
something<00:01:06.420> much<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.170> rugged<00:01:07.500> our<00:01:08.180> steampunk

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
something much more rugged our steampunk

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380 
something much more rugged our steampunk
is<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.570> fancy<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:11.100> adorned<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.880> extra

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
went through the list of the kind of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
went through the list of the kind of
weapons<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.259> player<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
weapons that the player would get the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.690 
weapons that the player would get the
most<00:01:23.369> satisfaction<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> find<00:01:25.700> unique

most satisfaction out of and find unique

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.929 
most satisfaction out of and find unique
ways<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.270> powering<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.350> these<00:01:28.500> weapons

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
ways of powering all of these weapons

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.399 
ways of powering all of these weapons
ultimately<00:01:29.939> myself<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.810> another<00:01:31.049> artist

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
ultimately myself and another artist

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
ultimately myself and another artist
went<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.789> train<00:01:33.030> yard<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.570> took

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
went down to the train yard and took

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
went down to the train yard and took
literally<00:01:34.649> hundreds<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.100> pictures<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.609> then

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
literally hundreds of pictures and then

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
literally hundreds of pictures and then
would<00:01:36.149> go<00:01:36.329> through<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> pick<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.070> images

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
would go through and pick out the images

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
would go through and pick out the images
and<00:01:38.700> scale<00:01:39.179> them<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> place<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and scale them down and place them on

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.870 
and scale them down and place them on
the<00:01:40.409> surface<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.979> our<00:01:41.280> weapons<00:01:41.700> themselves

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the surface of our weapons themselves

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.599 
the surface of our weapons themselves
and<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.929> gave<00:01:43.200> us<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.859> really<00:01:44.280> heavy

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
and that gave us that really heavy

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.580 
and that gave us that really heavy
industrial<00:01:45.359> look<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.990> were<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.380> for

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
industrial look that we were going for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.270 
industrial look that we were going for
in<00:01:47.369> our<00:01:47.549> vehicle<00:01:47.999> designs<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:50.039> look<00:01:50.249> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
in our vehicle designs we really look to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.910 
in our vehicle designs we really look to
push<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.240> element<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> steampunk<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.710> leave

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
push that element of steampunk we leave

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
push that element of steampunk we leave
them<00:01:53.039> in<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.219> very<00:01:53.399> skeletal<00:01:53.819> nature<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
them in a very skeletal nature so that

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
them in a very skeletal nature so that
you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> inner<00:01:55.859> workings<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.549> can

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you can see the inner workings you can

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.599 
you can see the inner workings you can
see<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.259> structures<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.920> hold<00:01:59.280> everything

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
see the structures that hold everything

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.200 
see the structures that hold everything
together

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
together

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.550 
together
steampunk<00:02:01.139> really<00:02:01.859> allowed<00:02:02.249> us<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:03.229> push<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
steampunk really allowed us to push the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.669 
steampunk really allowed us to push the
time<00:02:04.799> period<00:02:05.569> forward<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.229> point<00:02:07.499> where

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
time period forward to the point where

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.130 
time period forward to the point where
we<00:02:07.859> could<00:02:08.130> really<00:02:08.429> capture<00:02:09.270> any<00:02:09.690> type<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
we could really capture any type of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
we could really capture any type of
gameplay<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:11.069> could<00:02:11.220> imagine<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.910> was

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
gameplay that we could imagine that was

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.210 
gameplay that we could imagine that was
