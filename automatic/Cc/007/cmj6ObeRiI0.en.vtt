00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.700 

the<00:01:34.480> next<00:01:34.720> thing<00:01:34.870> is<00:01:34.930> studying<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.380> link

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
the next thing is studying the link

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.180 
the next thing is studying the link
under<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.100> lengths<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.460> go<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.700> browse<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
under the lengths you go to browse and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.800 
under the lengths you go to browse and
you<00:01:39.190> find<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.580> image<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:40.120> you<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.420> saved

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.750 

which<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.960> here<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.650> see<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.280> big

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
which is here and you can see the big

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.420 
which is here and you can see the big
images<00:01:49.060> on<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.450> screen<00:01:49.570> right<00:01:49.750> now<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
images on the screen right now and to

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.980 
images on the screen right now and to
make<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.700> easier<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:55.360> match<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.810> call

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
make it easier to to match the call

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.140 
make it easier to to match the call
today<00:01:56.260> what<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.040> can<00:01:57.220> do<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.520> go<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.910> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
today what you can do is go to the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.250 
today what you can do is go to the
adjust<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.320> value<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.869> adjust<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.020> one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
adjust the value of the adjust the one

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.480 
adjust the value of the adjust the one
here<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.810> transparency<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.710> to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
here so the transparency is to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.880 
here so the transparency is to
transparency<00:02:07.180> value<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.570> here<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.709> can

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
transparency value in here and you can

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.610 
transparency value in here and you can
see<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:10.000> make<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.330> map<00:02:10.530> transparent<00:02:11.530> and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
see that to make the map transparent and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.020 
see that to make the map transparent and
then<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.370> make<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:14.910> adjust<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
then you can make the like adjust the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.110 
then you can make the like adjust the
position<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.780> image<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.790> match

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
position of the image so that you match

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.020 
position of the image so that you match
the<00:02:19.420> image<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.020> Google<00:02:20.620> Google<00:02:21.430> Earth<00:02:21.610> it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
the image on the Google Google Earth it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.510 
the image on the Google Google Earth it
takes<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.050> little<00:02:23.200> bit<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.410> time<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:24.130> do<00:02:24.370> this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
takes a little bit of time to do this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.320 
takes a little bit of time to do this
kind<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.910> battery<00:02:26.370> life<00:02:27.370> example<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.120> match

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
kind of battery life example you match

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.110 
kind of battery life example you match
the<00:02:28.600> coastline<00:02:29.170> from<00:02:29.380> here<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.880> make

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
the coastline from here and you can make

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.740 
the coastline from here and you can make
match<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.810> move<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.350> border<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:34.000> then

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
match to move the border here and then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.440 
match to move the border here and then
move<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.140> border<00:02:35.440> here<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:41.400> okay<00:02:42.450> after

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
move the border here and here okay after

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.920 
move the border here and here okay after

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
cable it will show up as a drive the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.550 
cable it will show up as a drive the
drive<00:03:20.530> i<00:03:20.830> show<00:03:21.280> up<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> xdrive<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:23.080> common

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
drive i show up is a xdrive so common

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.760 
drive i show up is a xdrive so common
it's<00:03:23.830> dry<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.490> then<00:03:25.240> under<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.260> hips<00:03:26.410> drive

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
it's dry and then under the hips drive

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
it's dry and then under the hips drive
there's<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:28.170> garland<00:03:29.170> folder<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.860> here<00:03:30.640> you

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
there's a garland folder and here you

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.670 
there's a garland folder and here you
need<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.060> create<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.480> folder<00:03:31.750> called<00:03:32.110> custom

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
need to create a folder called custom

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.400 
need to create a folder called custom
maps<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.350> go<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.950> custom<00:03:36.340> maps<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
maps so you go to the custom maps and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.060 
maps so you go to the custom maps and
now<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.460> say<00:03:39.820> save<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.690> name<00:03:40.870> as<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> ubc

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
now you say save the name as a ubc

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.920 
now you say save the name as a ubc
campus<00:03:42.700> maps<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.300> then<00:03:43.510> say<00:03:43.660> yes<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.570> then

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
campus maps and then say yes and then

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.560 
campus maps and then say yes and then
that<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.260> not<00:03:47.440> on<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.590> map<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:47.980> my<00:03:48.160> GPS<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:49.270> looks

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
that is not on a map on my GPS it looks

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.320 
that is not on a map on my GPS it looks
like<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> image<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.440> save<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.310> has<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.790> be<00:03:51.880> jpg

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
like the image you save it has to be jpg

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.810 
like the image you save it has to be jpg
if<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.630> use<00:03:52.810> give<00:03:53.170> or<00:03:53.410> are<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.800> format<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
if you use give or are the format the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.860 
if you use give or are the format the
mat<00:03:55.120> may<00:03:55.480> not<00:03:55.720> show<00:03:56.140> up<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.650> on<00:03:57.490> your<00:03:57.670> GPS<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.840> I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
mat may not show up in on your GPS so I

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.870 
mat may not show up in on your GPS so I
found<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.500> map<00:03:59.680> here<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.250> that's<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.730> one

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
found a map here that that's the one

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.710 
found a map here that that's the one
except<00:04:01.270> one<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.510> had<00:04:02.310> down<00:04:03.310> low<00:04:03.460> as<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.940> KMZ

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
except one I had down low as the KMZ

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.410 
except one I had down low as the KMZ
files<00:04:05.320> from<00:04:05.710> a<00:04:05.830> google<00:04:06.220> earth<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.150> can

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
files from a google earth so you can

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.650 
files from a google earth so you can
zoom<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.110> yes<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:09.190> can<00:04:09.340> see<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.760> has<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.270 

has<00:04:13.660> pretty<00:04:14.080> good<00:04:14.440> resolution<00:04:15.280> in<00:04:15.430> there

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.890 

the<00:04:21.280> other<00:04:21.430> thing<00:04:21.640> is<00:04:21.790> what<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.390> can<00:04:22.540> do<00:04:22.690> with

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
the other thing is what you can do with

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.350 
the other thing is what you can do with
this<00:04:23.080> kind<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.500> custom<00:04:24.160> map<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.550> like<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:25.090> can

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
this kind of custom map is like you can

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.880 
this kind of custom map is like you can
use<00:04:25.690> for<00:04:26.170> example<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:27.010> map<00:04:27.640> from<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.890> lonely

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
use for example a map from a lonely

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.550 
use for example a map from a lonely
planet<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:31.060> say<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.930> is<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.260> map<00:04:32.530> of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
planet and you can say this is a map of

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.120 
planet and you can say this is a map of
a<00:04:32.860> cup<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.130> shoddy<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.760> can<00:04:34.380> find<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.500> map<00:04:35.710> on

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
a cup of shoddy you can find a map on

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.460 
a cup of shoddy you can find a map on
google<00:04:36.250> earth<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.210> then<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.690> when<00:04:38.170> you<00:04:38.260> go

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
google earth and then you when you go

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.290 
google earth and then you when you go
there<00:04:38.680> you<00:04:39.220> will<00:04:39.370> know<00:04:39.580> where<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.880> find<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
there you will know where to find the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.320 
there you will know where to find the
hotels<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:42.070> other<00:04:42.220> thing<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.580> do<00:04:42.820> is<00:04:43.000> to

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
hotels the other thing you can do is to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.890 
hotels the other thing you can do is to
use<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:44.160> historical<00:04:45.160> map<00:04:45.370> or<00:04:46.030> even<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.390> map<00:04:46.630> I'd

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
use the historical map or even a map I'd

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.770 
use the historical map or even a map I'd
assume<00:04:47.230> so<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:48.040> long<00:04:48.250> as<00:04:48.310> they're<00:04:48.790> up<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.360> scale

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
assume so as long as they're up to scale

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.470 
assume so as long as they're up to scale
then<00:04:50.410> they<00:04:50.980> should<00:04:51.250> be<00:04:51.280> quite<00:04:51.640> useful<00:04:51.910> as<00:04:52.450> a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
then they should be quite useful as a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.990 
then they should be quite useful as a
custom<00:04:53.230> man<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.830> would<00:04:54.340> like<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.490> say<00:04:54.730> another

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
custom man I would like to say another

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.260 
custom man I would like to say another
thing<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.780> if<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.290> want<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.920> make<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.130> huge<00:04:58.000> map

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
thing is if you want to make a huge map
