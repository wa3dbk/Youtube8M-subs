 have we ever bought any of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.210
 these consoles we should not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.429
 buy these consoles because these are 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.410

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.339

 curiosities of video games if you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.200
 forgot to say hello 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.750
 in friends I was busy thinking how much 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 I should pay you for this video shut up and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 let's start, you remember the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.490
 famous console and loved by many of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.000
 we 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.740
 this is the nes what its acronyms are 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.290
 nintendo entertainment system is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.240
 console has been copied cloned one of 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.160
 your cheap and badly made clones is the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.560
 police station continues to prick a 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.420
 example of it is I'm playing with my 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.030
 police tenacity that happened to my beautiful 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.070
 console has been locked when I was 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.260
 playing with the super Mario bros the final 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.210
 as my grandparents say they hit 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.610
 kicked and will repair this is what 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.980
 would happen if some of us were 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.380
 to buy one of these consoles and this 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.840
 you have three versions one is worse than 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 another is to say politicization has its 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.220
 three versions one more ridiculous than the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.980
 another and the last police tession that is the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.080
 3 is battery powered since its parts are 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.970
 very low quality and these are damaged to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 the week and the games you have are what 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.810
 of the nes but it is not the same as 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.420
 play it with the original console or the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.760
 PSP console is not saved because they 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.930
 he also has his copy and this one only has 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.180
 a game but what is this shit xd 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 and the worst thing is that parents are wrong 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.709
 and they buy you these shits or if you do not 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.630
 do to spend less money here a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.420
 example for pa pa pa pa pa I want a 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.709
 console ok son tomorrow I'll go with your mother 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 to buy a console 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.180
 the child waits until tomorrow for his console 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.819
 new very excited and discover a great 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.739
 tasteless surprise the father says this 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.350
 but what is this shit your mother what 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.870
 I thought I bought something 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.870
 better but we have bought we must 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.060
 vote this shit we apologize son all 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.459
 It was your father's fault the message or 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.650
 moraleja is not buying cheap consoles 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.989
 like these nor the last consoles 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.580
 generation have been saved by 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.100
 example had been one of his 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.230
 victims this does not look like in the wii in 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.660
 relationship in quality since they have 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.700
 poor quality sensors and has games 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.069
 that invite to the games of the wii but 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.800
 I would not recommend this since all 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.080
 we know that they get damaged fast here is the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.060
 criticism of politicization is a console 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 of very poor quality is created by the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.110
 Chinese and this one is copied from the model 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.210
 original console with graphics 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.070
 of the nes in most cases 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.410
 of the times of nes it was about 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.570
 pirate but the cartridges prevented it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.240
 Then came the CD that is much more 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.220
 easy to hack thanks to the pc helped 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.220
 a lot in this but the boom was with the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.720
 ps1 that used cd thanks for watching the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.610
 first part of the video 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.600
 now we go to the curiosities of the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.960
 videogames let's start 1 the mapping 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.750
 playable of gta san andreas is almost 44 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.660
 square kilometers that is more or less 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.650
 five times the size of liberty city ​​and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.930
 four times the size of bike city 2 in 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.270
 the original arcade of donkey kong mario 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.470
 it's called human and it's a carpenter not a 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.500
 plumber 3 nintendo never surnamed to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.280
 mario 4 the title of peking is in honor 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.290
 of the dog of shigeru miyamoto 5 final 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.420
 fantasy was named for the fact that 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.370
 the creator and co-founder of school and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.380
 lolo busacca gucci used the latest 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.500
 reserves of company money for 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.530
 do what 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.600
 -actor watani the creator of pacman is 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.580
 the idea of creating this video game 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.380
 while one day he ate pizza with some 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.970
 friends and saw the figure that was at 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 take the first piece of one of the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.420
 pizzas 7 gta 5 is the video game that has 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.290
 got the highest collection by 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.110
 sales in a single day 8 link is left-handed 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.660
 because miyamoto is also 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.850
 9 you knew that the towers of the screen 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.160
 of playstation 2 start represent 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.020
 the games that have been played there 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.210
 one tower for each game played and the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.120
 highest tower refers to the title 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.370
 in which more time has been invested 10 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.870
 after the blockbuster dt was prepared 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.290
 a video game inspired by the movie 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.450
 for the atari 2600 they were so safe 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.950
 that it would be a bomb that they made 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.590
 more cartridges than the number of 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.540
 video game consoles that had sold a 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.610
 simple and boring mechanics attached to a 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.470
 huge flaw in the game made atari 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.740

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.240
 cartridges of the friendly extraterrestrial 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.400
 according to the urban legend 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.590
 atari opted to bury the games of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.009
 ete in a desert of new mexico for 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.169
 avoid 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.360
 high cost involved in storing them 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.759
 in the place where it is believed that 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.460
 they buried there is a sign that says here 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.460
