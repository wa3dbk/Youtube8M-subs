I go to the University right and I study
film<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:46.070> animation<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.780> spent<00:01:49.679> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
film or more animation so I spent the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
film or more animation so I spent the
past<00:01:50.039> week<00:01:50.990> sitting<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> drawing<00:01:52.880> my<00:01:53.899> movie

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
past week sitting and drawing my movie

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.620 
past week sitting and drawing my movie
that<00:01:55.289> I'm<00:01:55.410> making<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:57.350> probably<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.530> be

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that I'm making and probably will be

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.309 
that I'm making and probably will be
doing<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.899> same<00:02:00.929> thing<00:02:01.580> for<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.789> next<00:02:03.319> at

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
doing the same thing for the next at

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.310 
doing the same thing for the next at
least<00:02:05.569> two<00:02:06.569> months<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.530> guess

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
least two months I guess

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.319 
least two months I guess
hopefully<00:02:10.320> faster<00:02:10.799> but<00:02:11.040> hey<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.989> mind<00:02:13.500> as

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
hopefully faster but hey I don't mind as

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.640 
hopefully faster but hey I don't mind as
you<00:02:15.329> might<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.660> guessed<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:16.200> doing<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you might have guessed I'm doing a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.600 
you might have guessed I'm doing a
classical<00:02:17.640> animation<00:02:18.019> drawn<00:02:19.019> animation<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
classical animation drawn animation that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.360 
classical animation drawn animation that
means<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.480> draw<00:02:21.959> each<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.920> frames

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
means I have to draw each of the frames

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.900 
means I have to draw each of the frames
in<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.120> movie<00:02:24.769> separately<00:02:25.769> or<00:02:25.980> like

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
in the movie separately or like

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.870 
in the movie separately or like
different<00:02:27.480> layers<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> frames<00:02:28.880> for

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
different layers on the frames for

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.120 
different layers on the frames for
example<00:02:31.130> one<00:02:32.130> second<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.660> movie<00:02:34.440> usually<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
example one second in a movie usually is

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.380 
example one second in a movie usually is
24<00:02:36.090> frames<00:02:36.950> animators<00:02:37.950> usually<00:02:38.400> draw<00:02:38.940> 12

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
24 frames animators usually draw 12

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.920 
24 frames animators usually draw 12
frames<00:02:40.019> per<00:02:40.290> second<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.459> they<00:02:42.269> double<00:02:42.690> each

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
frames per second so they double each

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.360 
frames per second so they double each
frame<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> won't<00:02:44.880> notice<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.140> difference

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
frame your I won't notice the difference

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.789 
frame your I won't notice the difference
you<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:47.519> notice<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.269> like<00:02:48.630> my<00:02:49.049> cameras

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
you will notice if it's like my cameras

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.009 
you will notice if it's like my cameras
and<00:02:50.010> stuff<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.670> if<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:51.030> drawn<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.810> won't

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
and stuff but if it's drawn you won't

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.280 
and stuff but if it's drawn you won't
notice<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.850> means<00:02:54.120> if<00:02:54.329> let's<00:02:54.989> say<00:02:55.049> my

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
notice that that means if let's say my

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.979 
notice that that means if let's say my
movie<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.709> six<00:02:56.609> minutes<00:02:56.820> long<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.690> can

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
movie is six minutes long you can

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.610 
movie is six minutes long you can
probably<00:02:58.530> guess<00:02:59.329> how<00:03:00.329> many<00:03:00.440> pictures<00:03:01.440> are

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
probably guess how many pictures are

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.690 
probably guess how many pictures are
draw<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.810> lot

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.770 

and<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:11.999> I'm<00:03:12.060> giving<00:03:12.749> the<00:03:13.260> whole<00:03:13.530> model<00:03:14.780> full

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and now I'm giving the whole model full

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.989 
and now I'm giving the whole model full

coat of the coated arms cut coated arms
coated<00:03:21.540> arms<00:03:22.069> superwash<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.459> found<00:03:24.239> out<00:03:24.420> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
coated arms superwash I found out that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.330 
coated arms superwash I found out that
these<00:03:25.560> could<00:03:26.370> cut<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.879> arms<00:03:27.269> superwash

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
these could cut the arms superwash

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.280 
these could cut the arms superwash
paints<00:03:29.340> are<00:03:29.750> really<00:03:30.750> really<00:03:31.109> good<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:33.290> once

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
paints are really really good and once

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.379 
paints are really really good and once
they<00:03:34.469> dry<00:03:34.680> out<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:35.189> leave<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:35.999> really

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
they dry out they leave this really

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:43.550 
they dry out they leave this really
natural<00:03:37.430> nice<00:03:38.430> thin<00:03:39.150> coat<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.370> I'm<00:03:42.560> so

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
natural nice thin coat and I'm so

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.589 
natural nice thin coat and I'm so
impressed<00:03:43.709> by<00:03:44.129> it<00:03:44.189> that<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.939> already

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
impressed by it that I have already

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.159 
impressed by it that I have already
ordered<00:03:45.840> all<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.469> their<00:03:46.680> different<00:03:47.510> tones<00:03:48.510> for

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
ordered all of their different tones for

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.039 
ordered all of their different tones for
the<00:03:49.439> super<00:03:49.769> wash<00:03:50.000> I'd<00:03:51.000> say<00:03:51.269> they're<00:03:51.540> even<00:03:51.780> a

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
the super wash I'd say they're even a

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.369 
the super wash I'd say they're even a
bit<00:03:52.199> better<00:03:52.409> than<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.540> legendary<00:03:54.540> Games

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
bit better than the legendary Games

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.209 
bit better than the legendary Games
Workshop<00:03:55.919> washes<00:03:56.849> like<00:03:57.530> butter<00:03:58.530> black<00:03:58.919> and

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
Workshop washes like butter black and

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.619 
Workshop washes like butter black and
stuff<00:03:59.669> like<00:03:59.849> that<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.209> next<00:04:01.019> up<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.500> heavy<00:04:02.040> gray

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
stuff like that so next up is heavy gray

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.130 
stuff like that so next up is heavy gray
or<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:04.109> gray<00:04:04.349> color

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
or the gray color

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.220 
or the gray color
and<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.620> applied<00:04:07.810> fairly<00:04:09.310> liberally<00:04:11.230> just

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
and I applied fairly liberally just

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.890 
and I applied fairly liberally just
giving<00:04:12.800> those<00:04:12.980> little<00:04:13.550> waves<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:17.420> really

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
giving those little waves and I really

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.789 
giving those little waves and I really
don't<00:04:18.109> mind<00:04:18.590> if<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.420> if<00:04:20.420> it's<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.780> bit<00:04:20.930> wet<00:04:21.410> and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
don't mind if it if it's a bit wet and

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.450 
don't mind if it if it's a bit wet and
goes<00:04:22.490> into<00:04:22.970> all<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.510> crevices<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.860> stuff

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
goes into all of the crevices and stuff

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.640 
goes into all of the crevices and stuff
like<00:04:25.670> that<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.120> know<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.870> don't<00:04:26.930> mind<00:04:27.230> cuz

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
like that I know I don't mind cuz

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.080 
like that I know I don't mind cuz
afterwards<00:04:28.220> we're<00:04:28.580> going<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.820> give<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.060> some

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
afterwards we're going to give it some

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.310 
afterwards we're going to give it some
more<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.050> super<00:04:30.380> wash<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.990> when<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.140> go<00:04:33.290> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
more of the super wash and when we go to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.730 
more of the super wash and when we go to
the<00:04:33.740> main<00:04:34.280> hull<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.300> tank<00:04:35.540> it's<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.530> same

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
the main hull of the tank it's the same

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.360 
the main hull of the tank it's the same
thing<00:04:37.040> just<00:04:39.520> as<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:41.480> can<00:04:41.630> see<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.919> first<00:04:42.919> rolled

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
thing just as you can see I first rolled

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.390 
thing just as you can see I first rolled
out<00:04:43.520> lines<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.240> wave<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.660> then<00:04:44.870> paint<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
out lines of the wave and then paint the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.320 
out lines of the wave and then paint the
inside<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.970> it

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
inside of it

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.750 
inside of it
this<00:04:47.810> way<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.050> found<00:04:48.530> out<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:49.070> it's<00:04:49.280> way

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
this way I found out that it's way

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.060 
this way I found out that it's way
easier<00:04:51.640> because<00:04:52.640> afterwards<00:04:53.419> we'll<00:04:53.690> be

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
easier because afterwards we'll be

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.770 
easier because afterwards we'll be
weathering<00:04:55.070> I'll<00:04:55.610> be<00:04:55.850> weathering<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.510> tank

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
weathering I'll be weathering the tank

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.480 
weathering I'll be weathering the tank
also<00:04:57.340> so<00:04:58.340> we<00:04:58.460> really<00:04:58.970> doesn't<00:04:59.410> bother<00:05:00.410> me<00:05:00.590> it

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
also so we really doesn't bother me it

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.790 
also so we really doesn't bother me it
goes<00:05:01.850> into<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.270> engine<00:05:02.419> grills<00:05:03.050> or<00:05:03.440> something

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
goes into the engine grills or something

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.130 
goes into the engine grills or something
like<00:05:03.980> that

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
like that

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.420 
like that
drone<00:05:06.140> animation<00:05:06.760> it's<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:08.150> lot<00:05:08.390> of<00:05:08.510> work<00:05:08.750> and

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
drone animation it's a lot of work and

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.260 
drone animation it's a lot of work and
it's<00:05:10.430> dying<00:05:10.880> profession<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.780> guess<00:05:12.050> because

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
it's dying profession I guess because

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.480 
it's dying profession I guess because
doing<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.510> by<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.750> coop<00:05:15.200> with<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.680> computer<00:05:16.370> is

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
doing it by the coop with a computer is

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.000 
doing it by the coop with a computer is
a<00:05:16.520> way<00:05:16.850> easier<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.750> think<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.770> learn

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
a way easier but I think that you learn

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:31.800 
a way easier but I think that you learn
a<00:05:19.040> lot<00:05:19.340> more<00:05:19.400> about<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:20.240> motion

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.980 

next<00:05:32.810> up<00:05:32.930> pistol<00:05:33.800> brown<00:05:34.040> or<00:05:34.340> pasty<00:05:34.700> brown<00:05:34.990> this

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
next up pistol brown or pasty brown this

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.600 
next up pistol brown or pasty brown this
is<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.650> bit<00:05:37.070> darker<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:38.540> bit<00:05:39.470> more<00:05:39.770> of<00:05:40.160> a<00:05:40.310> red

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
is a bit darker and a bit more of a red

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.440 
is a bit darker and a bit more of a red
or<00:05:40.970> orange<00:05:41.210> tone<00:05:41.750> brown<00:05:43.150> compared<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.300> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
or orange tone brown compared to the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.790 
or orange tone brown compared to the
yellowish<00:05:45.050> leather<00:05:45.560> brown<00:05:45.890> so<00:05:47.440> this<00:05:48.440> is<00:05:48.590> just

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
yellowish leather brown so this is just

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.710 
yellowish leather brown so this is just
to<00:05:48.920> give<00:05:49.100> this<00:05:50.320> darker<00:05:51.320> tone<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.280> tank

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
to give this darker tone to the tank

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.760 
to give this darker tone to the tank
actually<00:05:54.040> can't<00:05:55.040> see<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.880> well<00:05:56.530> through<00:05:57.530> the

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
actually can't see that well through the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:06.510 
actually can't see that well through the
washed<00:05:58.610> leather<00:05:59.330> brown<00:05:59.660> but<00:06:00.220> but<00:06:01.220> it<00:06:01.340> works

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:25.840 

also<00:06:07.520> doing<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:07.970> same<00:06:08.000> wave<00:06:08.630> actions

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.000 

now<00:06:26.850> I'm<00:06:27.540> going<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:27.900> take<00:06:28.110> leather<00:06:28.350> brown<00:06:28.740> and

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
now I'm going to take leather brown and

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.060

waves<00:06:49.200> over<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:49.920> tank<00:06:50.210> will<00:06:51.210> give<00:06:51.420> this<00:06:51.600> nice

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
waves over the tank will give this nice

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.800 
waves over the tank will give this nice
contrast<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:52.890> bring<00:06:53.220> out<00:06:53.400> the<00:06:53.910> heavy<00:06:54.450> gray

as well
it<00:07:27.930> will<00:07:28.470> be<00:07:28.730> a<00:07:29.730> lot<00:07:30.360> better<00:07:30.570> than<00:07:30.990> the<00:07:31.470> for

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:31.890 
it will be a lot better than the for

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.800 
it will be a lot better than the for
example<00:07:31.980> the<00:07:32.400> previous<00:07:32.610> tiger<00:07:33.180> tank<00:07:33.510> that<00:07:33.780> I

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810 
example the previous tiger tank that I

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.350 
example the previous tiger tank that I
painted<00:07:34.260> up<00:07:34.440> so<00:07:35.340> it's<00:07:35.520> in<00:07:35.670> the<00:07:35.790> same<00:07:36.030> color

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
painted up so it's in the same color

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.920 
painted up so it's in the same color
scheme<00:07:36.780> the<00:07:37.050> camo<00:07:37.860> style<00:07:38.190> is<00:07:38.310> a<00:07:38.370> bit<00:07:38.490> different

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930 
scheme the camo style is a bit different

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.580
