I guess this is my seat rail from

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.360 
I guess this is my seat rail from
private<00:00:05.250> label<00:00:05.730> manufacturing<00:00:06.740> and<00:00:07.740> I

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
private label manufacturing and I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.650 
private label manufacturing and I
ordered<00:00:08.820> specifically<00:00:09.719> seat<00:00:10.650> rails<00:00:11.210> for<00:00:12.210> my

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
ordered specifically seat rails for my

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.049 
ordered specifically seat rails for my
Recaro<00:00:13.080> seats<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:13.830> are<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:14.940> are

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
Recaro seats which are here these are

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.300 
Recaro seats which are here these are
the<00:00:15.150> genuine<00:00:15.570> Recaro<00:00:16.049> seats<00:00:16.910> SPG's<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:19.310> put

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the genuine Recaro seats SPG's and put

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.490 
the genuine Recaro seats SPG's and put
the<00:00:20.550> rails<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:24.180> looks<00:00:24.390> good<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the rails on and it looks good here and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.009 
the rails on and it looks good here and
here<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.609> looks<00:00:26.789> pretty<00:00:26.880> good<00:00:27.269> fits<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.810> up

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
here it looks pretty good fits right up

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.669 
here it looks pretty good fits right up
but<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.099> doesn't<00:00:29.400> bolt<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:30.900> frame<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.560> my

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
but it doesn't bolt to my frame in my

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.610 
but it doesn't bolt to my frame in my
car<00:00:32.570> this<00:00:33.570> side<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.980> side<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.260> gap

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
car this side and this side is not gap

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.709 
car this side and this side is not gap
far<00:00:38.010> enough<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:40.469> probably<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.340> like

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
far enough so you probably have to like

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
far enough so you probably have to like
take<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:42.899> bolts<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.620> draw<00:00:44.579> another<00:00:44.820> hole

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
take these bolts out draw another hole

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.510 
take these bolts out draw another hole
it's<00:00:45.960> almost<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.440> whoever<00:00:46.800> did<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.219> part

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's almost like whoever did this part

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's almost like whoever did this part
had<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.760> slide<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.840> too<00:00:52.020> far<00:00:52.230> surprised<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
had these slide up too far surprised to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.279 
had these slide up too far surprised to
move<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.789> exact<00:00:54.149> same<00:00:54.420> distance<00:00:54.809> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
move these the exact same distance like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.099 
move these the exact same distance like
just<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> initial<00:00:57.000> work<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
just like that initial work I think so

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
just like that initial work I think so
I'm<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.320> try<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.469> redo<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.219> drill<00:00:59.489> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
I'm gonna try to redo that we drill that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
I'm gonna try to redo that we drill that
and<00:01:00.510> try<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> gain<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.260> passenger

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and try to gain this is on the passenger

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.620 
and try to gain this is on the passenger
side<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.670> don't<00:01:05.820> mind<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> car<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.479> all

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
side and don't mind the car is all

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.620 
side and don't mind the car is all
trashed<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:08.360> okay<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.420> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
trashed up right now I know okay so we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.130 
trashed up right now I know okay so we
got<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> retest<00:01:10.320> fit<00:01:10.530> before<00:01:10.890> final<00:01:11.310> drilling

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
got a retest fit before final drilling

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
got a retest fit before final drilling
and<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.650> did<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.400> took

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and what I actually did was I just took

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480 
and what I actually did was I just took
that<00:01:14.670> bottom<00:01:15.270> plate<00:01:15.509> off<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> rail<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.009> be

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that bottom plate off the rail and be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.770 
that bottom plate off the rail and be
sure<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> lock<00:01:17.939> tight<00:01:18.210> these<00:01:18.360> putting<00:01:18.689> put

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sure to lock tight these putting put

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
sure to lock tight these putting put
these<00:01:18.869> back<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.950> did<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.549> just

unloosen<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> basic<00:01:24.299> screw<00:01:24.630> driver

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
unloosen these but a basic screw driver

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
unloosen these but a basic screw driver
came<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.259> out<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:26.369> bad<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.610> needs

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
came right out so that's bad that needs

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.109 
came right out so that's bad that needs
to<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.180> properly<00:01:27.810> tightened<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.439> could<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to be properly tightened down could be a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.840 
to be properly tightened down could be a
hazard<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.130> people<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> buy<00:01:32.430> these<00:01:32.490> on

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
hazard for people that buy these on

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.270 
hazard for people that buy these on
rails<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.840> everybody<00:01:34.350> who<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:34.799> bought<00:01:35.070> these

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
rails so everybody who has bought these

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.719 
rails so everybody who has bought these
rails<00:01:36.200> be<00:01:37.200> sure<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.799> lot<00:01:38.070> Loctite

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.690 
these bolts down anyways i've undid this
this<00:01:43.079> bracket<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.710> here<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.070> attaches<00:01:44.159> via

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
this bracket down here that attaches via

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
this bracket down here that attaches via
two<00:01:44.939> screws<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.170> saw<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
two screws that you just saw and it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100 
two screws that you just saw and it
basically<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.490> slid<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> front<00:01:48.390> screw<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
basically just slid the front screw that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.100 
basically just slid the front screw that
was<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> front<00:01:49.860> hole<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:54.689> screw<00:01:54.960> was

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
was in the front hole this screw was

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.389 
was in the front hole this screw was
originally<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.710> hole<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.219> slid<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
originally in this hole I just slid it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
originally in this hole I just slid it
back<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.210> another<00:01:57.659> hole<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
back so this is another hole on this

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
back so this is another hole on this
bracket<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.520> now<00:01:59.700> over<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.299> can

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
bracket that's now over here you can

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.600 
bracket that's now over here you can
either<00:02:00.869> choose<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> drill<00:02:01.680> hole<00:02:01.920> over<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.100> we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
either choose to drill hole over here we

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.130 
either choose to drill hole over here we
can<00:02:02.820> choose<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.509> drill<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:04.110> through

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
can choose to just drill right through

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800 
can choose to just drill right through
this<00:02:04.560> bracket<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.119> hole<00:02:06.360> already<00:02:06.540> on

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this bracket with this hole already on

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
this bracket with this hole already on
there<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.409> gonna<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.000> re
