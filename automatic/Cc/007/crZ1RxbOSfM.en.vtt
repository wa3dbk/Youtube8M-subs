I'm gonna use this autumn carpenter
cutter<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.540> texture<00:00:07.019> set<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.470> make<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
cutter and texture set to make the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.860 
cutter and texture set to make the
snowflakes<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.549> are<00:00:09.150> gonna<00:00:09.240> go<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.660> this

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
snowflakes that are gonna go on this

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.369 
snowflakes that are gonna go on this
cake

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
cake

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.189 
cake
there<00:00:10.980> are<00:00:11.280> five<00:00:11.580> cutters<00:00:12.180> included<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.020> the

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
there are five cutters included in the

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.019 
there are five cutters included in the
set<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.680> the<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:13.949> larger<00:00:14.369> cutters<00:00:14.610> are<00:00:14.850> too

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
set but the two larger cutters are too

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.760 
set but the two larger cutters are too
big<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.510> a<00:00:15.570> cake<00:00:15.840> this<00:00:16.049> size<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:16.650> not

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
big for a cake this size so I'm not

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.170 
big for a cake this size so I'm not
going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> use<00:00:17.220> them<00:00:17.490> I'm<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> use

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
going to use them I'm just going to use

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.390 
going to use them I'm just going to use
the<00:00:18.359> three<00:00:18.630> smaller<00:00:19.080> cutters<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.189> handy

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the three smaller cutters and it's handy

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.200 
the three smaller cutters and it's handy
because<00:00:20.910> each<00:00:21.539> texture<00:00:22.529> sheet<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.609> texture

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
because each texture sheet has a texture

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
because each texture sheet has a texture
for<00:00:24.630> each<00:00:24.960> cutter<00:00:25.349> shape<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.550> gonna<00:00:26.669> be

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
for each cutter shape so I'm gonna be

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450 
for each cutter shape so I'm gonna be
able<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.359> six<00:00:27.779> unique<00:00:28.199> snowflakes<00:00:29.189> which

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
able to have six unique snowflakes which

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
able to have six unique snowflakes which
is<00:00:29.640> nice<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.480> no<00:00:30.839> two

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
is nice because you know no two

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.600 
is nice because you know no two
snowflakes<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.769> alike<00:00:34.130> you<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.310> need<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
snowflakes are alike you just need to be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280 
snowflakes are alike you just need to be
careful<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.330> position<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.930> cutters

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
careful when you position the cutters

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
careful when you position the cutters
that<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.130> don't<00:00:38.340> chop<00:00:38.700> off<00:00:38.910> any<00:00:39.240> of<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that you don't chop off any of the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.430 
that you don't chop off any of the
texture<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.810> see<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
texture but as you can see this is a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.140 
texture but as you can see this is a
super<00:00:43.860> quick<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.100> easy<00:00:44.340> technique<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.120> just

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
super quick and easy technique you just

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.540 
super quick and easy technique you just
roll<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> fondant<00:00:45.900> use<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.920> texture<00:00:47.220> sheet

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
roll the fondant use the texture sheet

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520 
roll the fondant use the texture sheet
to<00:00:47.730> add<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.240> snowflake<00:00:48.690> texture<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.380> then

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
to add the snowflake texture and then

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.369 
to add the snowflake texture and then
cut<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:49.950> snowflake<00:00:50.610> shapes

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.740 

and<00:00:56.500> I'm<00:00:57.250> going<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.460> need<00:00:57.609> six<00:00:58.000> snowflakes<00:00:58.570> so

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
and I'm going to need six snowflakes so

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.630 
and I'm going to need six snowflakes so
I'm<00:00:58.840> going<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.050> put<00:00:59.199> these<00:00:59.440> three<00:00:59.920> underneath

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
I'm going to put these three underneath

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.869 
I'm going to put these three underneath
the<00:01:01.199> plastic<00:01:02.199> flap<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.739> my<00:01:03.039> gum<00:01:03.339> paste<00:01:03.550> board

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
the plastic flap of my gum paste board

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.200 
the plastic flap of my gum paste board
so<00:01:04.089> they<00:01:04.210> don't<00:01:04.390> dry<00:01:04.659> out

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.480 

I've<00:01:09.600> sped<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> video<00:01:10.440> here<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.370> don't

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I've sped up the video here so you don't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
I've sped up the video here so you don't
have<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.940> get<00:01:12.150> bored<00:01:12.420> watching<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:13.020> roll<00:01:13.200> out

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
have to get bored watching me roll out

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
have to get bored watching me roll out
the<00:01:13.560> fondant<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.940> set<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the fondant but for this set of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.640 
the fondant but for this set of
snowflakes<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.870> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.410> other

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
snowflakes I'm going to use the other

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.940 
snowflakes I'm going to use the other
texture<00:01:17.550> sheet<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.840> snowflakes<00:01:19.740> all

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
texture sheet so that the snowflakes all

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.040 
texture sheet so that the snowflakes all
have<00:01:20.160> different<00:01:20.520> designs<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> same

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
have different designs but it's the same

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.780 
have different designs but it's the same
technique<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.860> roll<00:01:23.190> your<00:01:23.280> fondant<00:01:23.460> out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
technique you just roll your fondant out

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520 
technique you just roll your fondant out
place<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> texture<00:01:24.630> sheet<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.960> top<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.440> then

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
place the texture sheet on top and then

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
place the texture sheet on top and then
do<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.920> pass<00:01:26.190> with<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> rolling<00:01:27.000> pin<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.780> make

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
do one pass with the rolling pin to make

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
do one pass with the rolling pin to make
the<00:01:28.140> texture<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.710> fondant<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.400> then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the texture in the fondant and then

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
the texture in the fondant and then
carefully<00:01:29.940> place<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.750> snowflakes<00:01:31.260> over<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
carefully place the snowflakes over the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.730 
carefully place the snowflakes over the
textured<00:01:32.820> part<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.360> cut<00:01:33.990> them

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.980 

once<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.549> snowflakes<00:01:43.060> are<00:01:43.240> made<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.690> can<00:01:43.869> do

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
once your snowflakes are made you can do

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.450 
once your snowflakes are made you can do
the<00:01:44.080> fun<00:01:44.229> part<00:01:44.530> which<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.740> decorating<00:01:45.369> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the fun part which is decorating the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.609 
the fun part which is decorating the
cake<00:01:45.640> with<00:01:45.820> them<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.150> like<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.810> use<00:01:46.900> piping<00:01:47.409> gel

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
cake with them I like to use piping gel

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.430 
cake with them I like to use piping gel
as<00:01:47.890> my<00:01:48.250> glue<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:49.450> stick<00:01:49.510> cut<00:01:50.020> out<00:01:50.170> fondant

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
as my glue to stick cut out fondant

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.340 
as my glue to stick cut out fondant
pieces<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.640> rolled<00:01:52.330> fondant<00:01:52.510> covered<00:01:53.110> cake

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
pieces to a rolled fondant covered cake

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.940 
pieces to a rolled fondant covered cake
I<00:01:54.240> don't<00:01:55.240> really<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.750> plan<00:01:56.080> or<00:01:56.530> anything

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
I don't really have a plan or anything

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.530 
I don't really have a plan or anything
like<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.580> far<00:01:57.610> as<00:01:57.820> placing<00:01:58.420> these

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
like that as far as placing these

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.999 
like that as far as placing these
snowflakes<00:01:58.840> I'm<00:01:59.290> just<00:01:59.440> kind<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.650> sticking

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
snowflakes I'm just kind of sticking

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.550 
snowflakes I'm just kind of sticking
them<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.190> here<00:02:00.700> randomly<00:02:01.350> certainly<00:02:02.350> if

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
them on here randomly certainly if

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.280

big blank spaces in between the larger
snowflakes<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.170> I'm<00:02:41.800> using<00:02:42.040> piping<00:02:42.700> gel<00:02:42.910> to

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
snowflakes and I'm using piping gel to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.220 
snowflakes and I'm using piping gel to
stick<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> sprinkles<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.709> cake<00:02:46.230> this

stick the sprinkles to the cake this

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.660 
stick the sprinkles to the cake this
won't<00:02:47.470> take<00:02:47.709> very<00:02:47.739> long<00:02:47.980> because<00:02:48.340> once<00:02:48.519> again

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
won't take very long because once again

won't take very long because once again
I've<00:02:48.940> sped<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.450> video<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.959> you

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.840 

and<00:02:55.170> I'm<00:02:55.770> not<00:02:55.950> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.310> worry<00:02:56.490> about<00:02:56.670> that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and I'm not going to worry about that

and I'm not going to worry about that
tear<00:02:57.330> down<00:02:57.780> at<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.050> bottom<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> cake

tear down at the bottom of the cake

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.430 
tear down at the bottom of the cake
because<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:02:59.520> going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.820> do<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.450> twisted<00:03:01.170> rope

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
because I'm going to do a twisted rope

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.980 
because I'm going to do a twisted rope
border<00:03:01.800> which<00:03:02.160> should<00:03:02.610> cover<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.390> most<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.560 

to<00:03:07.770> make<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> twisted<00:03:08.640> rope<00:03:08.820> border<00:03:09.090> you

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
to make a twisted rope border you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.120 
to make a twisted rope border you
basically<00:03:10.410> are<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.740> take<00:03:10.920> two<00:03:11.100> pieces

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
basically are going to take two pieces

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.580 
basically are going to take two pieces
of<00:03:11.550> fondant<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.210> roll<00:03:12.270> them<00:03:12.690> into<00:03:13.200> long

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
of fondant and roll them into long

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.040 
of fondant and roll them into long
snakes<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.910> twist<00:03:15.270> them<00:03:15.450> together<00:03:15.660> I'm

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
snakes and then twist them together I'm

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.500 
snakes and then twist them together I'm
going<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.710> use<00:03:16.800> purple<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.370> white<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.000> it

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
going to use purple and white so that it

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.230 
going to use purple and white so that it
matches<00:03:18.660> my<00:03:19.200> snowflake<00:03:19.530> cake

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.660 

I<00:03:22.300> have<00:03:23.200> sped<00:03:23.530> up<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.860> video<00:03:23.980> here<00:03:24.490> because

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
I have sped up the video here because

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.580 
I have sped up the video here because
this<00:03:25.150> can<00:03:25.360> take<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.630> couple<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.050> minutes<00:03:26.320> if

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
this can take a couple of minutes if

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.920 
this can take a couple of minutes if
you're<00:03:27.010> lucky<00:03:27.370> enough<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.700> have<00:03:27.970> one<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.840> those

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
you're lucky enough to have one of those

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.130 
you're lucky enough to have one of those
presses<00:03:29.530> or<00:03:29.830> those<00:03:30.190> extruders<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.480> makes

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
presses or those extruders that makes

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.050 
presses or those extruders that makes
the<00:03:32.380> rope<00:03:32.560> for<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.370> obviously<00:03:33.610> this

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
the rope for you then obviously this

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.690 
the rope for you then obviously this
would<00:03:34.210> go<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> lot<00:03:34.780> quicker<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.340> ropes

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
would go a lot quicker and the ropes

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.210 
would go a lot quicker and the ropes
would<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:37.150> more<00:03:37.720> even<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.650> may<00:03:38.830> notice<00:03:39.190> that

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
would be more even you may notice that

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.100 
would be more even you may notice that
on<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:39.970> since<00:03:40.240> I'm<00:03:40.420> rolling<00:03:40.720> them<00:03:40.840> up<00:03:40.930> by

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
on these since I'm rolling them up by

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.650 
on these since I'm rolling them up by
hand<00:03:41.530> they're<00:03:42.070> not<00:03:42.250> perfectly<00:03:42.760> even<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.480> have

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
hand they're not perfectly even you have

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.420 
hand they're not perfectly even you have
a<00:03:43.690> couple<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.140> little<00:03:44.290> lumps<00:03:44.740> here<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.340> a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
a couple of little lumps here and a

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.980 
a couple of little lumps here and a
couple<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.790> spots<00:03:46.030> where<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.450> rope<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.810> maybe

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
couple of spots where the rope is maybe

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.780 
couple of spots where the rope is maybe
a<00:03:47.110> little<00:03:47.290> bit<00:03:47.530> thinner<00:03:47.560> than<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.250> rest<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.640> it

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
a little bit thinner than the rest of it

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.940 
a little bit thinner than the rest of it
I'm<00:03:49.090> not<00:03:49.420> gonna<00:03:49.540> worry<00:03:49.870> too<00:03:50.230> much<00:03:50.260> about<00:03:50.410> that

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
I'm not gonna worry too much about that

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.670 
I'm not gonna worry too much about that
because<00:03:51.280> once<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.450> two<00:03:52.600> colors<00:03:52.990> are<00:03:53.170> twisted

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
because once the two colors are twisted

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.510 
because once the two colors are twisted
together<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:55.200> slight<00:03:56.200> unevenness<00:03:57.010> won't<00:03:57.280> be

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
together the slight unevenness won't be

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.590 
together the slight unevenness won't be
as<00:03:57.820> noticeable

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
as noticeable

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.950 
as noticeable
I<00:03:59.520> usually<00:04:00.520> pinch<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.240> two<00:04:01.420> ropes<00:04:01.690> together

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
I usually pinch the two ropes together

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.830 
I usually pinch the two ropes together
at<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.650> top<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.160> then<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.790> will<00:04:04.240> twist<00:04:04.600> them

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
at the top and then I will twist them

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.770 
at the top and then I will twist them
from<00:04:05.140> both<00:04:05.470> ends<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:07.210> have<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> little<00:04:07.630> bit

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
from both ends and you have a little bit

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.960 
from both ends and you have a little bit
of<00:04:07.840> flexibility<00:04:08.440> here<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:09.040> could<00:04:09.310> make<00:04:09.550> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
of flexibility here you could make the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.530 
of flexibility here you could make the
Rope<00:04:10.720> pretty<00:04:11.170> tightly<00:04:11.860> twisted<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:13.270> if<00:04:13.450> you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
Rope pretty tightly twisted and if you

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.270 
Rope pretty tightly twisted and if you
decide<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.960> do<00:04:14.080> that<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.680> understand<00:04:15.160> that

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
decide to do that just understand that

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.800 
decide to do that just understand that
you're<00:04:15.460> gonna<00:04:15.550> need<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:16.030> start<00:04:16.299> off<00:04:16.510> with

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
you're gonna need to start off with

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.470 
you're gonna need to start off with
longer<00:04:17.410> snakes<00:04:17.799> because<00:04:18.400> in<00:04:18.760> order<00:04:18.880> for<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
longer snakes because in order for the

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.180 
longer snakes because in order for the
twists<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.230> be<00:04:20.350> really<00:04:20.620> tight<00:04:20.860> you're<00:04:21.100> gonna

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
twists to be really tight you're gonna

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.000 
twists to be really tight you're gonna
need<00:04:21.520> a<00:04:21.549> longer<00:04:22.060> bit<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.170> rope<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.440> work<00:04:23.800> with

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
need a longer bit of rope to work with

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
need a longer bit of rope to work with
and<00:04:24.220> order<00:04:24.400> for<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.610> go<00:04:24.760> all<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.000> way

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
and order for it to go all the way

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.700 
and order for it to go all the way

whatever you think looks best and then

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.650 
whatever you think looks best and then
to<00:04:33.190> put<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.670> rope<00:04:33.850> around<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.330> bottom<00:04:34.600> of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
to put the rope around the bottom of

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.840 
to put the rope around the bottom of
your<00:04:34.720> cake<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.710> need<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.220> know<00:04:36.400> where<00:04:36.730> the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
your cake you need to know where the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.940 
your cake you need to know where the
back<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.810> back<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.170> my<00:04:38.290> cake<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.710> that

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
back is on the back of my cake is that

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.640 
back is on the back of my cake is that
bit<00:04:39.160> where<00:04:39.370> it's<00:04:39.550> got<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.850> huge<00:04:40.060> tear<00:04:40.390> in<00:04:40.420> it

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
bit where it's got the huge tear in it

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.800 
bit where it's got the huge tear in it
and<00:04:41.650> then<00:04:41.860> you're<00:04:42.010> going<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.480> overlap<00:04:43.480> the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
and then you're going to overlap the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.440 
and then you're going to overlap the
rope<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.350> then<00:04:45.160> take<00:04:45.550> your<00:04:45.730> angled<00:04:46.180> spatula

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
rope and then take your angled spatula

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.960 
rope and then take your angled spatula
and<00:04:47.050> slice<00:04:47.410> down<00:04:47.440> straight<00:04:48.250> through<00:04:48.610> where<00:04:48.880> it

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
and slice down straight through where it

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.080 
and slice down straight through where it
overlaps<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.780> will<00:04:50.140> help<00:04:50.500> make<00:04:51.280> sure<00:04:51.640> that

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
overlaps that will help make sure that

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.390 
overlaps that will help make sure that
the<00:04:52.300> colors<00:04:52.750> match<00:04:53.050> up<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.860> should<00:04:54.070> help

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
the colors match up and it should help

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.900 
the colors match up and it should help
you<00:04:54.580> get<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.850> pretty<00:04:55.680> even<00:04:56.680> if<00:04:56.860> not<00:04:57.070> smooth<00:04:57.490> seam

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
you get a pretty even if not smooth seam

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.410 
you get a pretty even if not smooth seam
as<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:59.440> turns<00:04:59.710> out<00:04:59.980> my<00:05:00.220> camera<00:05:00.670> wasn't<00:05:00.880> running

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
as it turns out my camera wasn't running

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.300 
as it turns out my camera wasn't running
when<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.600> dusted<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.320> cake<00:05:02.530> with<00:05:02.770> super<00:05:03.070> pearl
