00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.010
 these things 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.650

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.330
 drop-down 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.330
 how 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.440

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.970
 that's how it would be 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.970
 what stands out 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.030

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.560
