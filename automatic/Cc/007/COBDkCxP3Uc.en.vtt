00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
now it will wear down with time

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.520 
now it will wear down with time
obviously<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:02.899> it'll<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> time

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
obviously but it'll be a bit of time

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.609 
obviously but it'll be a bit of time
before<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.979> happens

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
before that happens

so um automatically what I've done is
and<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.900> important<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.410> me

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and this is important to me

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.500

when<00:02:18.730> they<00:02:18.819> could<00:02:18.970> still<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.270> used<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.810> think<00:02:19.840> I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
when they could still be used I think I

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.840 
when they could still be used I think I

what he might need in the future and so
as<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.810> result<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.590> he<00:02:32.920> could<00:02:32.950> always<00:02:33.310> fix

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
as a result of that he could always fix

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.220 
as a result of that he could always fix
just<00:02:33.880> about<00:02:34.120> everything<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.630> he<00:02:34.690> never<00:02:34.900> ran

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
you could use to fix something which I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.720 
you could use to fix something which I
was<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.760> really<00:02:43.000> nice<00:02:43.209> um<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.620> think<00:02:45.250> he<00:02:45.520> he

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
was really really nice um I think he he

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.330 
was really really nice um I think he he
gave<00:02:45.910> me<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.120> love<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:46.600> fixing<00:02:46.959> things<00:02:47.340> but

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
gave me this love for fixing things but

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.910 
gave me this love for fixing things but
um<00:02:48.870> right<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.110> sprung<00:02:50.440> for<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.769> thing

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
um right so I sprung for this thing

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580 
um right so I sprung for this thing
which<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.130> more<00:02:51.430> expensive<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.420> 38<00:02:53.200> bucks

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
which is more expensive it's a 38 bucks

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.979 
which is more expensive it's a 38 bucks
I<00:02:53.739> believe<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.300> bought<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.690> instead

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
I believe and that I bought that instead

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.930 
I believe and that I bought that instead
of<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.260> regular<00:02:59.680> wheelbarrow<00:03:00.459> tire<00:03:00.700> which

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
of a regular wheelbarrow tire which

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.240 
of a regular wheelbarrow tire which
would<00:03:01.120> have<00:03:01.209> been<00:03:01.300> 25<00:03:01.840> bucks<00:03:02.080> but<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.130> me

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
would have been 25 bucks but for me

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.250 
would have been 25 bucks but for me
that's<00:03:03.370> worthwhile<00:03:03.640> for<00:03:04.269> one<00:03:04.450> thing<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.810> didn't

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
that's worthwhile for one thing I didn't

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.110 
that's worthwhile for one thing I didn't
buy<00:03:05.980> something<00:03:06.430> which<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.819> to<00:03:06.910> break

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
buy something which is going to break

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.630 
buy something which is going to break
down<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.420> few<00:03:07.860> months<00:03:08.860> down<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> road<00:03:09.190> anyway

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
down a few months down the road anyway

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.309 
down a few months down the road anyway
because<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.090> was<00:03:10.269> bound<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.810> run<00:03:10.959> into<00:03:10.989> more

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
because I was bound to run into more
