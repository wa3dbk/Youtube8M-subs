00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
series if you put it right next to the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.689 
series if you put it right next to the
regular<00:00:20.240> size<00:00:21.240> box<00:00:21.750> um<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.340> how<00:00:23.460> big

it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:25.640> guess<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.789> makes<00:00:27.570> sense<00:00:27.689> since<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it is I guess it makes sense since it is

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.910 
it is I guess it makes sense since it is
a<00:00:28.939> static<00:00:29.939> pose<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> figure<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.439> kept<00:00:31.710> in

a static pose that the figure is kept in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I'm looking for that symbol and so used

this figure that I think most often like
is<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:23.519> has<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:24.360> direct<00:02:24.690> power<00:02:24.900> source

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
is that it has one direct power source

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.449 
is that it has one direct power source
