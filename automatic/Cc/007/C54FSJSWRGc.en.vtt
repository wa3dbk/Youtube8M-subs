music sonic for game gear what's that
you<00:00:27.750> ask<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.199> don't<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.560> something<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.220> was

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you ask I don't know something that was

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
you ask I don't know something that was
supposed<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.789> compete<00:00:30.090> against<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> gameboy

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
supposed to compete against a gameboy

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.049 
supposed to compete against a gameboy
but<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> fell<00:00:31.500> off<00:00:31.710> before<00:00:32.099> 1998

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
but it fell off before 1998

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.850 
but it fell off before 1998
so<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.510> son<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> Sonic<00:00:34.649> games

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so it's son but where the Sonic games

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.799 
so it's son but where the Sonic games
good<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:36.180> thought<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:36.750> were

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
good on it I actually thought they were

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
good on it I actually thought they were
much<00:00:37.050> harder<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.590> after<00:00:38.010> sonic<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.610> took<00:00:38.879> off

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
much harder now after sonic one took off

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.760 
much harder now after sonic one took off
on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.300> Genesis<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:40.050> had<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> port<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> over

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
on the Genesis they had to port it over

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
on the Genesis they had to port it over
to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> Game<00:00:41.399> Gear<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.239> Master<00:00:42.780> System

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to the Game Gear and the Master System

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
to the Game Gear and the Master System
and<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.410> probably<00:00:43.590> wondering<00:00:44.190> what's

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and you're probably wondering what's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
and you're probably wondering what's
that<00:00:44.640> -<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> Master<00:00:45.870> System<00:00:46.020> came<00:00:46.410> out

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that - well the Master System came out

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
that - well the Master System came out
before<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.039> Genesis<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> compete<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
before the Genesis to compete with the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
before the Genesis to compete with the
NES<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> attic<00:00:49.500> success<00:00:49.950> no<00:00:50.489> but

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
NES was the attic success no but

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
NES was the attic success no but
basically<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.899> consoles<00:00:52.410> both<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
basically these consoles both got the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
basically these consoles both got the
8-bit<00:00:53.579> versions<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> Sonic<00:00:54.809> games<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
8-bit versions of the Sonic games and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
8-bit versions of the Sonic games and
it's<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> much<00:00:56.820> different<00:00:57.390> game<00:00:57.420> than

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's actually a much different game than

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.569 
it's actually a much different game than
the<00:00:58.079> original<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.010> came<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the original one that came out on the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.790 
the original one that came out on the
Genesis<00:01:00.270> you're<00:01:00.719> following<00:01:01.199> me<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.500> these

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
Genesis you're following me now these

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
Genesis you're following me now these
games<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.309> deviate<00:01:02.670> too<00:01:03.059> much<00:01:03.090> from<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
games don't deviate too much from the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
games don't deviate too much from the
standard<00:01:04.229> sonic<00:01:04.710> collect<00:01:05.040> all<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> emeralds

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
standard sonic collect all the emeralds

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570 
standard sonic collect all the emeralds
and<00:01:05.909> beat<00:01:06.150> dr.<00:01:06.600> Eggman<00:01:07.020> however<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.159> actually

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and beat dr. Eggman however you actually

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
and beat dr. Eggman however you actually
had<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> find<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.570> emeralds<00:01:10.200> within<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
had to find the emeralds within the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
had to find the emeralds within the
levels<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
levels that you go to but what about the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
levels that you go to but what about the
special<00:01:13.260> stages<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.920> ask<00:01:14.130> they're<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
special stages you ask they're all just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
special stages you ask they're all just
basically<00:01:15.390> spring<00:01:15.840> yard<00:01:16.080> zone<00:01:16.259> where<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
basically spring yard zone where you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.440 
basically spring yard zone where you
bounce<00:01:17.009> around<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> collect<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> bunch<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
bounce around and you collect a bunch of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.999 
bounce around and you collect a bunch of
rings<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.080> after<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> may<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
rings and then after that you may get a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
rings and then after that you may get a
continue<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.119> you're<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.390> need

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
continue or not what you're gonna need

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
continue or not what you're gonna need
because<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.320> game<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> hard<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.220> balls<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
because this game is hard as balls the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
because this game is hard as balls the
genesis<00:01:24.780> version<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.530> tough<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
genesis version was tough because I was

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.730 
genesis version was tough because I was
out<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.549> practice<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.720> games<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.409> only

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
out of practice but these games I only

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
out of practice but these games I only
played<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> gamecube<00:01:30.119> version<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
played them on the gamecube version of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
played them on the gamecube version of
Sonic<00:01:31.020> gems<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.740> my<00:01:31.920> god<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.549> had<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> same

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
Sonic gems and my god it had the same

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090 
Sonic gems and my god it had the same
problems<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.540> original<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.350> had<00:01:34.530> except<00:01:34.950> now

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
problems the original one had except now

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
problems the original one had except now
the<00:01:35.159> screen<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.880> smaller<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> limits

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the screen is smaller and now it limits

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
the screen is smaller and now it limits
your<00:01:37.530> perspective<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.729> problem

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
your perspective but that problem

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
your perspective but that problem
actually<00:01:39.630> carries<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> second

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
actually carries over to the second

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
actually carries over to the second
Sonic<00:01:41.460> game<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.180> released<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.720> the
