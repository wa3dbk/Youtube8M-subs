goes<00:00:48.600> down<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> start

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
goes down you see if I can get to start

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.340 
goes down you see if I can get to start
there<00:00:50.010> yet<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.670> starting<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.030> down

all that jazz makes your thirst bar go
down<00:01:00.510> far<00:01:00.770> faster<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.489> thirst<00:01:02.730> bar<00:01:02.910> gets

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
down far faster if your thirst bar gets

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140 
down far faster if your thirst bar gets
too<00:01:03.270> far<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.199> slow<00:01:04.700> um<00:01:05.700> you'll<00:01:06.000> get

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
too far you get slow um you'll get

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.490 
too far you get slow um you'll get
slowness<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> won't<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.080> able<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> sprint

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
is a little bit different you can't

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
is a little bit different you can't
really<00:01:37.860> build<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.369> dirt<00:01:38.610> let<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:38.970> show<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
really build with dirt let me show this

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
really build with dirt let me show this
off<00:01:39.689> real<00:01:39.930> quick<00:01:40.229> dirt<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.400> affected<00:01:41.850> by

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
off real quick dirt is affected by

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
off real quick dirt is affected by
gravity<00:01:43.850> I'll<00:01:44.850> take<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
gravity I'll take out this one so it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520 
gravity I'll take out this one so it
becomes<00:01:46.979> very<00:01:47.250> hard<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:48.270> course<00:01:48.600> oh<00:01:48.930> yeah

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
becomes very hard of course oh yeah

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.340 
becomes very hard of course oh yeah
grass<00:01:50.030> there<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.960> dirt<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
grass there we go as you can see dirt is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.859 
grass there we go as you can see dirt is
affected<00:01:52.680> by<00:01:52.770> gravity<00:01:52.829> grass<00:01:53.610> itself<00:01:54.299> isn't

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
affected by gravity grass itself isn't

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.880 
affected by gravity grass itself isn't
so<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.590> becomes<00:01:56.859> you<00:01:57.340> know<00:01:57.399> hard<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:58.030> actually

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so it becomes you know hard to actually

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.429 
so it becomes you know hard to actually
build<00:01:59.890> with<00:02:00.189> dirt<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.659> can<00:02:01.960> kind<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.289> cheat

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
build with dirt you can kind of cheat

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.990 
build with dirt you can kind of cheat
the<00:02:02.590> system<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.070> for<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.549> don't<00:02:03.880> know

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the system a little for now I don't know

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.990 
the system a little for now I don't know
if<00:02:04.060> there's<00:02:04.179> gonna<00:02:04.270> be<00:02:04.359> changed<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.049> can

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
if there's gonna be changed and you can

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.960 
if there's gonna be changed and you can
dig<00:02:07.000> out<00:02:07.270> grass<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.129> will<00:02:09.250> become<00:02:09.459> harder

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
dig out grass but it will become harder

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.690 
dig out grass but it will become harder
to<00:02:10.000> box<00:02:10.479> myself<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.459> going<00:02:12.580> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
to box myself in because it's going to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.640 
to box myself in because it's going to
fall<00:02:12.910> as<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.090> build<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.170> need<00:02:14.319> something

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
fall as you build so you need something

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.410 
fall as you build so you need something
to<00:02:14.709> make<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.860> base<00:02:15.040> out<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.340> mobs<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.239> Terra

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to make a base out of mobs and Terra

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.030 
to make a base out of mobs and Terra
Firma<00:02:16.629> crafts<00:02:16.900> are<00:02:17.049> plentiful<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.709> they<00:02:17.830> want

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
Firma crafts are plentiful and they want

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.330 
Firma crafts are plentiful and they want
to<00:02:18.160> kill<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.599> cutting<00:02:19.599> down<00:02:19.720> trees<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:21.250> want

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
to kill you cutting down trees you want

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.920 
to kill you cutting down trees you want
to<00:02:21.459> start<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.819> base<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.239> can't<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.810> by

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
to start at the base you can't do it by

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.300 
to start at the base you can't do it by
hand<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.470> need<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.739> make<00:02:23.830> an<00:02:23.980> axe<00:02:24.129> before

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
hand so you need to make an axe before

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.820 
hand so you need to make an axe before
you<00:02:24.519> get<00:02:24.640> started<00:02:24.959> when<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:25.989> chop<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.620> whole

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
you get started when you chop the whole

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.890 
you get started when you chop the whole
tree<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.129> gonna<00:02:27.370> come<00:02:27.549> down<00:02:27.580> at<00:02:27.849> once<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.329> it's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
tree is gonna come down at once and it's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.479 
tree is gonna come down at once and it's
gonna<00:02:29.049> use<00:02:29.260> durability<00:02:29.799> based<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.190> how<00:02:30.310> many

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
gonna use durability based on how many

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.610 
gonna use durability based on how many
trees<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:30.760> were<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:32.110> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.470> get

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
trees there were you're going to get

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.860 
trees there were you're going to get
these<00:02:32.860> logs<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:34.030> there's<00:02:34.420> two<00:02:34.569> ways<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
these logs if you there's two ways to

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.780 
these logs if you there's two ways to
use<00:02:34.989> these<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.500> right<00:02:35.709> click<00:02:35.739> it'll<00:02:36.280> place

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
use these if you right click it'll place

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.640 
use these if you right click it'll place
a<00:02:36.819> log<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:37.510> shift<00:02:37.780> right<00:02:38.019> click<00:02:38.049> that's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
a log if you shift right click that's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.860 
a log if you shift right click that's
gonna<00:02:38.890> place<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.099> log<00:02:39.430> pile<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.060> these<00:02:40.720> are

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
gonna place a log pile and these are

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.339 
gonna place a log pile and these are
just<00:02:40.989> storage<00:02:41.379> methods<00:02:41.799> for<00:02:42.250> logs<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:44.200> way

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
just storage methods for logs so one way

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.839 
just storage methods for logs so one way
to<00:02:44.379> deal<00:02:44.769> with<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> house<00:02:45.129> is<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.549> can<00:02:45.700> make

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
to deal with the house is you can make

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.080 
to deal with the house is you can make
it<00:02:45.970> out<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.090> wood<00:02:47.099> you're<00:02:48.099> going<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.459> need<00:02:48.610> wood

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
it out of wood you're going to need wood

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.759 
it out of wood you're going to need wood
does<00:02:49.299> take<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> while<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.720> shop<00:02:49.959> down<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.739> is

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
does take a while to shop down but it is

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.330 
does take a while to shop down but it is
a<00:02:50.890> nice<00:02:51.250> stable<00:02:51.730> early<00:02:52.209> game<00:02:52.360> structure<00:02:53.340> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
a nice stable early game structure you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.240 
a nice stable early game structure you
can't<00:02:54.579> make<00:02:54.760> doors<00:02:55.090> or<00:02:55.239> anything<00:02:55.420> yet<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.250> yeah

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
can't make doors or anything yet so yeah

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.259 
can't make doors or anything yet so yeah
just<00:02:57.579> realize<00:02:57.879> that<00:02:59.670> beyond<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.880> another

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
just realize that beyond that another

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.849 
just realize that beyond that another
good<00:03:01.480> early<00:03:01.870> game<00:03:02.049> house<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.500> if<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.680> take

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
good early game house is if you take

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.900 
good early game house is if you take
Stoney<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.480> stone<00:03:05.200> knife<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.829> shot<00:03:06.579> grass

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
Stoney then a stone knife and shot grass

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.750 
Stoney then a stone knife and shot grass
you're<00:03:07.450> gonna<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.750> scroll<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:09.459> straw

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
you're gonna get a scroll and the straw

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.089 
you're gonna get a scroll and the straw
can<00:03:10.630> be<00:03:10.720> turned<00:03:10.959> into<00:03:11.170> thatch<00:03:12.150> thatch<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:14.099> a

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
can be turned into thatch thatch is a

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.949 
can be turned into thatch thatch is a
nice<00:03:15.430> solid<00:03:15.700> block<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.599> breaks<00:03:16.810> very

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
nice solid block but it breaks very

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.809 
nice solid block but it breaks very
quickly<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.069> can<00:03:18.190> make<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> wood<00:03:18.609> house

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
quickly so you can make a wood house

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.690 
quickly so you can make a wood house
with<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.299> patch<00:03:19.540> door<00:03:19.840> or<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.950> could<00:03:21.160> as<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.459> said

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
with a patch door or you could as I said

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.580 
with a patch door or you could as I said
cheese<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.150> system<00:03:22.540> build<00:03:23.109> a<00:03:23.170> house<00:03:23.290> like

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
cheese the system build a house like

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.020 
cheese the system build a house like
this<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.239> then<00:03:25.239> that's<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.750> door<00:03:25.930> closed

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030
