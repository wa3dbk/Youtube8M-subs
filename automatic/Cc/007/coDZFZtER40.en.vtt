the<00:00:36.750> bike<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:38.010> usually<00:00:38.370> start<00:00:38.610> by

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the bike and I usually start by

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.139 
the bike and I usually start by
threading<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.200> hand<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.160> just

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
threading it on by hand first and just

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.450 
threading it on by hand first and just
threading<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> hand<00:00:43.020> tight<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.710> way<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
threading it hand tight that way you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
threading it hand tight that way you
make<00:00:44.699> sure<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.120> you're<00:00:45.239> not<00:00:45.390> cross

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
make sure that you're not cross

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
make sure that you're not cross
threading<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.829> threads<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.610> start<00:00:47.910> off

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
threading with threads if you start off

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.810 
threading with threads if you start off
with<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> wrench<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:48.900> away<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.770> can

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
with the wrench right away you can

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.030 
with the wrench right away you can
potentially<00:00:50.820> screw<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:52.590> crank<00:00:52.800> set

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
potentially screw up your crank set

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.490 
potentially screw up your crank set
which<00:00:53.550> would<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.880> be<00:00:54.030> good<00:00:54.380> secondly<00:00:55.380> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
which would not be good secondly you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
which would not be good secondly you
need<00:00:55.560> to<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.950> something<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.579> looks<00:00:56.640> like

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
need to get something that looks like

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
need to get something that looks like
pail<00:00:57.149> ranch<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.630> isn't<00:00:57.989> exactly<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.440> power

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

wrench<00:00:58.860> but<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.280> long<00:00:59.399> enough<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.790> will

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
wrench but still long enough that will

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
wrench but still long enough that will
give<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.899> enough<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.649> turn<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
give me enough for you turn up and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
give me enough for you turn up and then
you<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.309> start

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you put it on there and you start

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
you put it on there and you start
tightening<00:01:05.969> down

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.160 

and<00:01:10.729> tighten<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.759> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> snug<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and tighten down you can snug it up a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
and tighten down you can snug it up a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
going to be on for a long time you might

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.880 
going to be on for a long time you might
want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> consider<00:01:21.990> putting<00:01:22.289> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.649> bit<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
want to consider putting a little bit of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
want to consider putting a little bit of
grease<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.520> bread<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.390> easier<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
grease on the bread so make it easier to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
grease on the bread so make it easier to
come<00:01:25.259> off<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.280> sometimes<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.820> switching<00:01:27.149> out

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

of<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> difference<00:01:33.170> for<00:01:34.170> me<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:36.539> then<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.020> gets

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
of a difference for me and then it gets

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
reverse threaded so lefty loosey righty

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.270 
reverse threaded so lefty loosey righty
tighty<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:03.119> exactly<00:02:03.810> reversed<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.099> left

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
tighty is exactly reversed on the left

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
tighty is exactly reversed on the left
pedal<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.599> you<00:02:06.689> tighten<00:02:06.929> it<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:08.099> gay

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
pedal so when you tighten it up your gay

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.750 
pedal so when you tighten it up your gay
spin<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> left<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:11.130> get<00:02:11.280> start

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
spin it to the left to get start

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940 
spin it to the left to get start
tightening<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.260> alternative<00:02:13.799> way<00:02:13.829> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
tightening now an alternative way to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.860 
tightening now an alternative way to
remember<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.700> these<00:02:14.910> pals<00:02:15.239> are<00:02:15.480> threaded

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
remember that these pals are threaded

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.800 
remember that these pals are threaded
differently<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.609> think<00:02:17.810> you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
differently is if you just think you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.750 
differently is if you just think you
