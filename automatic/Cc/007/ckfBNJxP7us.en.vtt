Globus<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:10.050> I've<00:00:10.380> been<00:00:10.500> making<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:11.040> for

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
Globus and it's I've been making it for

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.370 
Globus and it's I've been making it for
a<00:00:11.820> couple<00:00:11.940> days<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.900> program<00:00:13.230> called

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
a couple days with a program called

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.369 
a couple days with a program called
GameMaker<00:00:14.009> studio<00:00:14.660> now<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.839> doesn't<00:00:16.109> sound

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
GameMaker studio now that doesn't sound

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.040 
GameMaker studio now that doesn't sound
all<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.190> guess<00:00:17.670> professional<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
all that I guess professional but it is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.050 
all that I guess professional but it is
actually<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.680> great<00:00:19.920> software<00:00:20.369> that's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
actually really great software that's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.439 
actually really great software that's
been<00:00:21.420> worked<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.519> long<00:00:23.939> time<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> has<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
been worked on for a long time it has a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.060 
been worked on for a long time it has a
ton<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> different<00:00:25.080> capabilities<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:26.039> can

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
ton of different capabilities you can

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
ton of different capabilities you can
export<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> lots<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.180> different<00:00:27.240> platforms

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
export it to lots of different platforms

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250 
export it to lots of different platforms
such<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:29.099> know<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.429> runtime<00:00:30.260> application

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
such as you know a runtime application

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.400 
such as you know a runtime application
or<00:00:31.529> even<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.520> consoles<00:00:33.149> web<00:00:33.600> browsers<00:00:34.170> or

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
or even like consoles web browsers or

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
or even like consoles web browsers or
even<00:00:34.680> mobile<00:00:34.860> apps<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.960> may<00:00:37.170> be

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
even mobile apps so I think you may be

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.030 
even mobile apps so I think you may be
turning<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> nap<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:40.040> basically

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
turning this into a nap and basically

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.709 
turning this into a nap and basically
this<00:00:41.309> program<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.910> allowed<00:00:42.149> me<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> what

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this program is allowed me to do what

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
this program is allowed me to do what
would<00:00:42.960> take<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.530> development<00:00:44.219> team<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.270> know

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
would take a development team you know

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.260 
would take a development team you know
weeks<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.110> make<00:00:46.289> Moss<00:00:47.039> possibly<00:00:47.700> months<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
weeks to make Moss possibly months you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.529 
weeks to make Moss possibly months you
know<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.600> 20<00:00:48.899> years<00:00:49.079> ago<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.300> pretty

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
know like 20 years ago and it's pretty

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
know like 20 years ago and it's pretty
cool<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.960> basically<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.190> white

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
cool so basically you're a little white

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.600 
cool so basically you're a little white
ball<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.629> hold<00:00:55.410> space<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
ball and you hold space to go up and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580 
ball and you hold space to go up and
release<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.809> down<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.050> you're<00:00:58.440> trying

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
release it to go down and you're trying

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.049 
release it to go down and you're trying
to<00:00:58.710> collect<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.340> little<00:00:59.640> white<00:00:59.789> ball

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to collect these little white ball

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.149 
to collect these little white ball
things<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.109> without<00:01:01.800> touching<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
things if you can without touching the

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
things if you can without touching the
without<00:01:05.159> touching<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> walls<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.720> then

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
without touching the walls so then

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.240 
without touching the walls so then
there's<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> high<00:01:07.560> score<00:01:07.890> account<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there's a high score account of that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
there's a high score account of that
saves<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.909> high<00:01:09.090> score<00:01:09.500> even<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
saves your high score even if you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
saves your high score even if you
restart<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> application<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
restart the application so when you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
restart the application so when you
download<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.830> run<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.850> will

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
download this and you run it it will

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.810 
download this and you run it it will
crack<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> crash<00:01:16.560> error<00:01:16.979> thing

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
crack there will be a crash error thing

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
crack there will be a crash error thing
so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> click<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.810> board<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so you just want to click a board and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
so you just want to click a board and
then<00:01:19.560> reopen<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.880> should<00:01:20.909> work<00:01:21.180> fine

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
then reopen it and it should work fine

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.130 
then reopen it and it should work fine
if<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.409> tell<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> comments<00:01:24.140> because

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
if not tell me in the comments because

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590 
if not tell me in the comments because
it's<00:01:25.290> basically<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:26.369> generating<00:01:27.360> some

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it's basically it's generating some

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
it's basically it's generating some
necessary<00:01:27.810> files<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> first<00:01:29.100> time<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
necessary files so the first time it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.670 
necessary files so the first time it
tries<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.880> run<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> doesn't<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.509> them<00:01:31.280> and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
tries to run it doesn't have them and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.880 
tries to run it doesn't have them and
yeah<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.090> I've<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.200> been<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.799> of
