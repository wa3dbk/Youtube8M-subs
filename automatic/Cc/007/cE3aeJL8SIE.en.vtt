back<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.580> mano<00:00:41.430> every<00:00:42.430> second<00:00:42.790> time<00:00:42.970> it's<00:00:43.210> a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
back to a mano every second time it's a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.870 
back to a mano every second time it's a
minus<00:00:43.930> seven<00:00:44.350> instead<00:00:44.860> of<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.220> mana

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.310 

now<00:00:49.880> here's<00:00:50.150> how<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.420> elf<00:00:50.780> technique

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
now here's how the elf technique

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.400 
now here's how the elf technique
enhances<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.100> effect<00:00:52.570> first<00:00:53.570> play<00:00:53.810> twice<00:00:54.140> at

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
enhances the effect first play twice at

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:23.100 
enhances the effect first play twice at
normal<00:00:54.770> speed<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.250> then<00:00:55.340> real<00:00:56.030> slow

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:57.959 

me<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.570> slow<00:01:25.780> version

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.020 

so<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.240> thing<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:01.460> third<00:02:01.729> down

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
so the thing is that the third down

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:26.890 
so the thing is that the third down
stroke<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.750> muted<00:02:03.409> by<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.770> pinky

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:44.809 

you

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:54.199 

you

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:08.920 

thank<00:02:55.209> you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.989
