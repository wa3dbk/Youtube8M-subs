any other question I've gotten somebody
asked<00:05:43.139> me<00:05:43.169> on<00:05:43.349> instagram<00:05:43.849> is<00:05:44.849> it<00:05:45.030> is<00:05:45.270> it

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
asked me on instagram is it is it

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.680 
asked me on instagram is it is it
permanent<00:05:46.039> from<00:05:47.039> my<00:05:47.159> understanding<00:05:47.690> depends

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
permanent from my understanding depends

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.899 
permanent from my understanding depends
on<00:05:48.750> how<00:05:48.900> consistent<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.469> are<00:05:49.680> with<00:05:50.099> it<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.430> mean

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
on how consistent you are with it I mean

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.629 
on how consistent you are with it I mean
I<00:05:51.090> think<00:05:51.150> about<00:05:51.719> why<00:05:52.050> corset<00:05:52.979> training<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.490> me

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
I think about why corset training to me

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.399 
I think about why corset training to me
is<00:05:53.849> almost<00:05:54.419> equivalent<00:05:54.659> of<00:05:54.960> wearing<00:05:55.080> braces

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
is almost equivalent of wearing braces

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.070 
is almost equivalent of wearing braces
right<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.789> wear<00:05:56.969> braces<00:05:57.270> because<00:05:57.570> you<00:05:57.900> want

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
right you wear braces because you want

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.719 
right you wear braces because you want
to<00:05:58.169> straighten<00:05:58.440> your<00:05:58.560> teeth<00:05:58.770> or<00:05:58.919> whatever<00:05:59.190> and

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
to straighten your teeth or whatever and

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:00.980 
to straighten your teeth or whatever and
after<00:06:00.060> your<00:06:00.180> braces<00:06:00.509> come<00:06:00.630> off<00:06:00.750> you<00:06:00.870> have<00:06:00.960> to

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
after your braces come off you have to

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.060 
after your braces come off you have to
wear<00:06:01.199> chain<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:01.650> if<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:01.800> don't<00:06:01.949> wear<00:06:02.039> your

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
wear chain and if you don't wear your

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
wear chain and if you don't wear your
retainer<00:06:02.430> your<00:06:02.580> teeth<00:06:02.729> you're<00:06:02.880> going<00:06:03.030> to

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
retainer your teeth you're going to

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.870 
retainer your teeth you're going to
probably<00:06:03.300> shift<00:06:03.719> back<00:06:03.990> let's<00:06:04.740> say<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:05.190> feel<00:06:05.729> at

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
probably shift back let's say I feel at

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.010 
probably shift back let's say I feel at
least<00:06:06.000> as<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.180> same<00:06:06.419> philosophy<00:06:06.870> when<00:06:06.900> it

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
least as the same philosophy when it

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.180 
least as the same philosophy when it
comes<00:06:07.229> to<00:06:07.320> coerce<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.620> train<00:06:07.800> I<00:06:07.830> think<00:06:08.099> that

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
comes to coerce a train I think that

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.249 
comes to coerce a train I think that
some<00:06:08.310> people<00:06:08.340> stare<00:06:08.669> typically<00:06:09.030> think<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:10.080> UM

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
some people stare typically think the UM

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.040 
some people stare typically think the UM
way<00:06:11.219> extreme<00:06:11.759> measures<00:06:12.150> like<00:06:12.419> I<00:06:12.570> mean<00:06:12.719> I<00:06:12.750> saw

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
way extreme measures like I mean I saw

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.810 
way extreme measures like I mean I saw
this<00:06:13.199> episode<00:06:13.650> of<00:06:13.680> tart<00:06:14.159> bank<00:06:14.400> when<00:06:14.580> they<00:06:14.669> had

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
this episode of tart bank when they had

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.370 
this episode of tart bank when they had
two<00:06:15.030> people<00:06:15.300> on<00:06:15.389> there<00:06:15.570> and<00:06:15.690> that<00:06:15.990> is<00:06:16.199> just

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
two people on there and that is just

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.399 
two people on there and that is just
extreme<00:06:16.919> I'm<00:06:17.669> not<00:06:18.300> talking<00:06:18.930> about<00:06:19.020> doing

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
extreme I'm not talking about doing

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.839 
extreme I'm not talking about doing
anything<00:06:19.530> extreme<00:06:19.949> like<00:06:20.159> that<00:06:20.370> the<00:06:20.669> lowest

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
anything extreme like that the lowest

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.040 
anything extreme like that the lowest
i'll<00:06:21.060> go<00:06:21.210> is<00:06:21.330> 22<00:06:21.810> inches<00:06:21.840> um<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.330> yeah<00:06:24.810> um

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
i'll go is 22 inches um and so yeah um

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.450 
i'll go is 22 inches um and so yeah um
what<00:06:25.949> else<00:06:26.330> uh-uh<00:06:27.620> as<00:06:28.620> far<00:06:28.860> as<00:06:28.889> organs

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
what else uh-uh as far as organs

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.779 
what else uh-uh as far as organs
shifting<00:06:30.120> you're<00:06:30.300> talking<00:06:30.690> long-term<00:06:31.789> you're

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
shifting you're talking long-term you're

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.730 
shifting you're talking long-term you're
talking<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.389> Gris<00:06:33.690> i<00:06:33.990> would<00:06:34.409> say<00:06:34.530> aggressive

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
talking a Gris i would say aggressive

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.219 
talking a Gris i would say aggressive
but<00:06:35.070> you're<00:06:35.190> talking<00:06:35.340> long-term<00:06:36.229> corset

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
but you're talking long-term corset

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.920 
but you're talking long-term corset
training<00:06:37.639> for<00:06:38.639> anything<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.330> start<00:06:39.539> to<00:06:39.659> shift

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
training for anything to start to shift

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.969 
training for anything to start to shift
it<00:06:40.289> depends<00:06:41.219> on<00:06:41.900> you<00:06:42.900> know<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.289> size<00:06:43.620> you<00:06:43.860> go

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
it depends on you know the size you go

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:44.629 
it depends on you know the size you go
down<00:06:44.159> to<00:06:44.339> because

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
down to because

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.209 
down to because
obviously<00:06:44.939> the<00:06:45.060> smaller<00:06:45.449> you<00:06:45.719> go<00:06:45.749> the<00:06:46.020> more<00:06:46.860> of

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
obviously the smaller you go the more of

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.809 
obviously the smaller you go the more of
a<00:06:47.280> chance<00:06:47.520> things<00:06:47.819> are<00:06:47.939> going<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.270> shift<00:06:48.539> um<00:06:48.870> I

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
a chance things are going to shift um I

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.450 
a chance things are going to shift um I
think<00:06:50.819> that<00:06:51.060> corset<00:06:51.780> train<00:06:52.110> is<00:06:52.349> is<00:06:52.830> being

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
think that corset train is is being

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.209 
think that corset train is is being
compared<00:06:53.879> to<00:06:54.029> child<00:06:54.599> not<00:06:54.960> wool<00:06:55.259> when<00:06:56.099> you're

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:56.219 
compared to child not wool when you're

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:57.619 
compared to child not wool when you're
pregnant<00:06:56.490> and<00:06:56.789> when<00:06:56.969> you're<00:06:57.090> pregnant<00:06:57.330> your

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:57.629 
pregnant and when you're pregnant your

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.570 
pregnant and when you're pregnant your
body<00:06:57.840> has<00:06:58.080> nine<00:06:58.379> months<00:06:58.830> basically<00:06:59.069> as<00:06:59.520> a

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
body has nine months basically as a

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.050 
body has nine months basically as a
fetus<00:07:00.569> the<00:07:00.930> baby<00:07:01.139> grows<00:07:01.529> and<00:07:01.949> it<00:07:02.099> moves<00:07:02.669> things

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
fetus the baby grows and it moves things

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.350 
fetus the baby grows and it moves things
around<00:07:03.270> it<00:07:04.219> changes<00:07:05.219> the<00:07:05.789> arrangement<00:07:06.300> of

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
around it changes the arrangement of

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.420 
around it changes the arrangement of
certain<00:07:06.659> things<00:07:06.900> that<00:07:07.020> look<00:07:07.289> you<00:07:07.469> know<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:07.860> so

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
certain things that look you know and so

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.019 
certain things that look you know and so
this<00:07:09.120> to<00:07:09.509> me<00:07:09.539> is<00:07:09.719> somewhat<00:07:10.289> similar<00:07:10.319> um<00:07:11.069> but

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:12.029 
this to me is somewhat similar um but

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:13.580 
this to me is somewhat similar um but
not<00:07:12.300> to<00:07:12.509> that<00:07:12.539> degree<00:07:12.719> because<00:07:13.289> like<00:07:13.409> I<00:07:13.529> said

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
not to that degree because like I said

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.149 
not to that degree because like I said
obviously<00:07:15.439> nothing's<00:07:16.439> been<00:07:16.620> shifted<00:07:17.039> or

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:17.159 
obviously nothing's been shifted or

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:18.709 
obviously nothing's been shifted or
moved<00:07:17.340> around<00:07:17.610> everything<00:07:17.909> is<00:07:18.120> exactly<00:07:18.300> where

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:18.719 
moved around everything is exactly where

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:22.369 
moved around everything is exactly where
its<00:07:18.840> intended<00:07:19.529> on<00:07:19.949> being<00:07:20.189> um<00:07:21.259> but<00:07:22.259> yeah

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:22.379 
its intended on being um but yeah

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:23.959 
its intended on being um but yeah
