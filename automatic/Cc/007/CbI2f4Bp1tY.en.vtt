00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.870
 hello kids here boots here 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.399
 I bring my first video very useful for 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.120
 servers and I guess a lot of people 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.710
 It may interest you, I'll explain how 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.450
 put the name of the video I'm going to 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.300
 explain how to do is how to do 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.490
 plots like this by regions ie 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.630
 give the power of a region to a 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.080
 person is to be able to build on it 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.449
 basically here there is no defined region 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 you know with the word one you can see it's worth 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.550
 then if you take from a corner 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.379
 until the other 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.680
 you are choosing your area to build 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.680
 you have to put 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.720
 What is your vote and procedures? 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.310
 the area from here to infinity 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.300
 down and from there is influencing 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.460
 upwards 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.829
 that is to say anything that builds 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.829
 that way it will be protected 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.580
 if not only protect you would only knit this 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.350
 zone 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 in the layer but menezes pam 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.799
 once you have that has write region 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.689
 define space and write the name of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.940
 the plot and in this case already put part 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.010
 of the pep 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.530
 once you have this you have already defined the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.280
 region as a test plot and you can already 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.680
 see what is defined can you with no no 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.040
 I can build here is to say now 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.890
 same could not build worth then 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.390
 to give me construction permits to me 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.500
 or anyone would have to put 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.530
 region to a the space parcel test the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.750
 name of the plot space the owner in 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.070
 this case I am four lack 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.600
 just in case I will put all the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.730
 commands in the description so that we 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.940
 you read putting the do not see it well in 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.330
 the good video once I give to the entity 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.020
 put region parcel test is valid and now 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.180
 when I give him with leather he puts can you get 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.650
 I can already build the plot is already 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.750
 my name 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.790
 I want to add more owner because you do what 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:17.180
 same but with another name for example 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 tower and you put that person in your web 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:26.540
 and you have two owners the other one is not deleted 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.420
 once you have that, what do you want 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040
 do not break the aisles because what 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.200
 will do as extraction is not defined or 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.680
 they will break the corridors because you have to 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.739
 do the same thing you have to come here 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.950
 and protect from here to here as it 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.950
 protects 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:51.440
 and then region defines corridor 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.280
 it's one she has this 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.860
 already people can not can not break 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.110
 none of this 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.690
 Who do you want to do? 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.150
 you want to remove a region you want to remove 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.740
 the text plot or you want to remove the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.590
 owners to remove the two you have to 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.120
 remove the plot 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.690
 OK 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.880
 It is the easiest thing to take away good 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.800
 you want to remove the you have to put 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.910
 region remove space parcel name 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.100
 of the part you give and region remo is worth 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.850
 there is no region you can already build what 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.270
 you want 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.190
 it is totally unprotected 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.920
 and it 's what you want to increase that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.690
 this region that reaches here and is 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.470
 that up here, you have to catch 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.140
 from here to where is the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.590
 limit the other or increase the end 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.590
 here 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.670
 you have to catch here and you put 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.620
 expand again with two bars 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:07.130
 we are always in spanair copper 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.220
 region redefines space name of 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.520
 advance what is called hallways once 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.220
 and then now instead of being up 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.920
 here now it is a bit more to where 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.620
 I've put it here, it's here 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.050
 what I was explaining to you and good 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.760
 until the first tutorial of my channel 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.760
 and I hope to see you soon
