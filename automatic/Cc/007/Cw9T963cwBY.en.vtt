I<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.890> no<00:00:35.160> idea<00:00:36.110> cuz<00:00:37.110> these<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.440> eyes<00:00:37.770> that

I have no idea cuz these up eyes that
once<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.360> got<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.550> missile<00:00:41.550> program<00:00:41.910> work

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
once I got in the missile program work

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
once I got in the missile program work
that<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.540> gold<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.829> show<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that get on gold but I'm gonna show you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.270 
that get on gold but I'm gonna show you
and<00:00:44.820> let<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.410> TRX<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> way

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and let me get this TRX out of the way

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.760 
and let me get this TRX out of the way
first

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
first

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
first
okay<00:00:49.940> now<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:52.219> can<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> sensitivity

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
okay now this can go up to a sensitivity

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.700 
okay now this can go up to a sensitivity
or<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.899> don't<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.230> don't<00:00:58.410> pick<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
or for and don't really don't pick up a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
or for and don't really don't pick up a
lot<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.520> always<00:00:59.910> cranked<00:01:00.300> up

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
lot of this but I got always cranked up

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
lot of this but I got always cranked up
before<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.730> show<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:04.729> how<00:01:05.729> this

before and I'm gonna show you how this

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.960 
before and I'm gonna show you how this
thing<00:01:06.680> does<00:01:09.860> have<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> class<00:01:11.700> ring

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
thing does have you see the class ring

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.520 
thing does have you see the class ring
over<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.720> kinda<00:01:12.960> hard<00:01:13.049> doing<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
over here it's kinda hard doing from the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:26.800 
over here it's kinda hard doing from the
side<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.040> you'll<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:20.990> broken<00:01:21.990> ring

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:42.050 

there's<00:01:27.810> another<00:01:27.990> piece<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:40.670> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
there's another piece of it this is the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.410 
there's another piece of it this is the
gold<00:01:42.930> ear<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.290> here

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
gold ear right here

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
gold ear right here
nothing<00:01:46.189> go<00:01:47.189> reran<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:48.380> nothing<00:01:49.939> there's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
nothing go reran there nothing there's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
nothing go reran there nothing there's
gold<00:01:51.119> chain<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.869> only<00:01:52.110> place<00:01:52.350> it'll<00:01:52.860> pick<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
gold chain the only place it'll pick it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
gold chain the only place it'll pick it
up<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.759> lobster<00:01:54.149> call<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> gonna

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
up is on this lobster call and you gonna

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.940 
up is on this lobster call and you gonna
be<00:01:54.930> touching<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:58.140> rest<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> chain<00:01:59.869> yeah

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.180 

not<00:02:04.300> just<00:02:05.300> right<00:02:05.510> there

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
not just right there

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.140 
not just right there
all<00:02:07.190> right<00:02:09.340> now<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:12.350> TRX<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.610> go<00:02:13.760> up<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
all right now the TRX it can go up to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.810 
all right now the TRX it can go up to
sensitivity<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:14.870> four<00:02:15.110> which<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.890> lot<00:02:16.760> of

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
sensitivity or four which is a lot of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.870 
sensitivity or four which is a lot of
times<00:02:17.000> actually<00:02:17.270> pretty<00:02:17.990> noisy<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.730> got

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
times actually pretty noisy but I got

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.700 
times actually pretty noisy but I got
this<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.210> set<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.540> sensitivity<00:02:21.200> three

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
this and set on the sensitivity three

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.470 
this and set on the sensitivity three
you<00:02:22.130> can<00:02:22.250> turn<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.520> down<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.820> want<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.150> watch

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you can turn it down you want to watch

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:47.380 
you can turn it down you want to watch
this<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:30.140> farm<00:02:30.470> away<00:02:33.490> anything<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:47.240> can

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
this to farm away anything and you can

00:02:47.390 --> 00:03:01.930 
this to farm away anything and you can
be<00:02:47.480> away<00:02:47.810> from<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.080> chain<00:02:59.560> but<00:03:00.560> anyway<00:03:00.940> shoot

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
be away from that chain but anyway shoot

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.590 
be away from that chain but anyway shoot
it<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:06.220> know<00:03:07.220> what<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.700> like<00:03:07.880> say<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.360> don't

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
it and know what it is like say I don't

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.170 
it and know what it is like say I don't
have<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.840> guide<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.380> trick<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.860> there<00:03:10.180> they

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
have a guide to that trick on there they

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.979 
have a guide to that trick on there they
don't<00:03:11.390> know<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.660> work<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.989> way<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.810> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
don't know they work that way and I

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.720 
don't know they work that way and I
forgot<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.380> tell<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:16.550> even

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
forgot to tell you that you can even

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.240 
forgot to tell you that you can even
some<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:17.360> when<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.660> picks<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:17.989> up<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.500> don't

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
some of this when it picks it up I don't

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.590 
some of this when it picks it up I don't
know<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.519> can<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:19.760> or<00:03:19.880> not<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.360> try<00:03:20.540> to
