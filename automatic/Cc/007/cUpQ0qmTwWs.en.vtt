tenemos<00:01:48.180> Krista<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:49.409> we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
tenemos Krista but I think that now we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
tenemos Krista but I think that now we
have<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.280> concentrated<00:01:50.640> than<00:01:50.939> ever

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
have to be more concentrated than ever

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
have to be more concentrated than ever
because<00:01:51.450> every<00:01:51.869> year<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> passes<00:01:52.590> it's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
because every year the passes it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
because every year the passes it's
harder<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.159> more<00:01:53.250> competitive<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
harder and more competitive we want to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.530 
harder and more competitive we want to
enjoy<00:01:55.110> great<00:01:55.439> things<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> we

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
enjoy great things and to do that we

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.389 
enjoy great things and to do that we
have<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> play<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.409> two<00:01:58.829> hundred<00:01:58.950> percent

have to play at two hundred percent
efforts<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.290> thought<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.680> those

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
