00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.339 

and<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:35.699> BMW<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.659> completely<00:04:37.259> different

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
and the BMW is a completely different

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.059 
and the BMW is a completely different
animal<00:04:37.860> it's<00:04:38.129> a<00:04:38.220> four-cylinder<00:04:38.909> it's<00:04:40.069> just

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
animal it's a four-cylinder it's just

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.980 
animal it's a four-cylinder it's just
gobs<00:04:41.789> of<00:04:42.000> horsepower<00:04:42.389> this<00:04:43.379> size<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:44.129> roughly

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
gobs of horsepower this size is roughly

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.399 
gobs of horsepower this size is roughly
I'm<00:04:45.990> gonna<00:04:46.169> say<00:04:46.259> 120<00:04:46.949> tops<00:04:47.729> 125<00:04:48.689> I<00:04:48.719> don't<00:04:49.259> even

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
I'm gonna say 120 tops 125 I don't even

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.520 
I'm gonna say 120 tops 125 I don't even
think<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.650> does<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:50.569> horsepower<00:04:51.569> and<00:04:51.870> then

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
think it does that horsepower and then

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.830 
think it does that horsepower and then
the<00:04:52.650> BMW<00:04:53.159> is<00:04:53.219> 190<00:04:53.819> I<00:04:53.969> mean<00:04:54.240> we're<00:04:54.419> talking<00:04:54.770> just
