00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
production is pretty good however when

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.050 
production is pretty good however when
we<00:00:25.660> zoom<00:00:25.900> in<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.619> try<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.189> see<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.730> details

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
when we have taken this photo with our

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.490 
when we have taken this photo with our
dish<00:00:36.699> like<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.180> there<00:00:37.840> is<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.080> other<00:00:38.199> one

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
dish like and there is the other one

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.710 
dish like and there is the other one
which<00:00:38.680> has<00:00:39.460> been<00:00:39.489> taken<00:00:39.940> without<00:00:40.239> the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
which has been taken without the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.920 
which has been taken without the
artificial<00:00:41.019> light<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.530> in<00:00:42.370> this<00:00:42.910> one<00:00:43.150> it<00:00:43.720> is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
artificial light and in this one it is

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.200 
artificial light and in this one it is
looking<00:00:44.140> quite<00:00:44.890> dark<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.550> color<00:00:45.730> production

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
looking quite dark the color production

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.030 
looking quite dark the color production
in<00:00:46.330> this<00:00:46.510> one<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:46.839> not<00:00:47.019> looking<00:00:47.350> good<00:00:47.530> so<00:00:47.949> the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
in this one is not looking good so the

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.770 
in this one is not looking good so the
overall<00:00:48.430> color<00:00:48.670> production<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.299> the<00:00:49.510> device

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
overall color production of the device

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.149 
overall color production of the device
especially<00:00:49.930> in<00:00:50.320> case<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.650> are<00:00:50.739> taking<00:00:50.890> a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
especially in case you are taking a

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.490 
especially in case you are taking a
photo<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:51.790> low-light<00:00:52.390> scenario<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:52.930> not<00:00:53.229> going

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
photo in low-light scenario is not going

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.090 
photo in low-light scenario is not going
to<00:00:53.710> be<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.250> great<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.559> how<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.920> will

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
to be that great and this is how it will

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.500 
to be that great and this is how it will
look<00:00:57.129> like<00:00:57.309> when<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.790> have<00:00:57.940> good<00:00:58.119> amount<00:00:58.330> of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
look like when you have good amount of

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.570 
look like when you have good amount of
light<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:59.019> this<00:00:59.589> case<00:00:59.830> the<00:00:59.979> color<00:01:00.129> production

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
light in this case the color production

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.520 
light in this case the color production
is<00:01:00.670> good<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.239> details<00:01:01.600> are<00:01:01.809> not<00:01:02.140> good<00:01:02.350> on

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
is good and the details are not good on

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.760 
is good and the details are not good on
any<00:01:02.860> one<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.190> them<00:01:03.400> so<00:01:04.119> this<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.989> again<00:01:05.260> kind<00:01:05.560> of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
any one of them so this is again kind of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.380 
any one of them so this is again kind of
disappointing<00:01:06.340> but<00:01:06.490> again<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.119> cannot

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
disappointing but again you cannot

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.630 
disappointing but again you cannot
expect<00:01:07.750> much<00:01:08.080> from<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.860> 8<00:01:09.040> megapixel<00:01:09.610> camera

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
expect much from the 8 megapixel camera

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.480 
expect much from the 8 megapixel camera
it<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.540> quite<00:01:10.840> decent<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:12.010> far<00:01:12.280> as<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
it is quite decent as far as the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.010 
it is quite decent as far as the
equaling<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.939> picture<00:01:13.210> camera<00:01:13.510> performance<00:01:13.869> is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
equaling a picture camera performance is

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.780 
equaling a picture camera performance is
confirmed<00:01:14.439> but<00:01:14.650> compared<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.250> those<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.460> other

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
confirmed but compared to those of other

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.390 
confirmed but compared to those of other
devices<00:01:16.119> which<00:01:16.510> also<00:01:16.780> have<00:01:17.140> 8<00:01:17.740> megapixel

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
devices which also have 8 megapixel

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.639 
devices which also have 8 megapixel
camera<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.789> would<00:01:18.939> say<00:01:19.119> it<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.359> not<00:01:19.659> very<00:01:20.409> much

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
camera I would say it is not very much

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.830 
camera I would say it is not very much
up<00:01:20.829> to<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.070> mark<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:22.210> here<00:01:22.390> we<00:01:22.539> have<00:01:22.570> the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
up to the mark now here we have the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.300 
up to the mark now here we have the
photo<00:01:23.079> settings<00:01:23.380> as<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.679> can<00:01:23.829> see<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.100> can

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
photo settings as you can see you can

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.219 
photo settings as you can see you can
take<00:01:24.579> a<00:01:24.609> self-timer<00:01:25.240> short<00:01:25.659> assess<00:01:25.990> my

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
take a self-timer short assess my

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.560 
take a self-timer short assess my
tutorial<00:01:26.829> so<00:01:27.009> there<00:01:27.219> you<00:01:27.789> have<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:28.000> buff<00:01:28.299> with

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
tutorial so there you have a buff with

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.719 
tutorial so there you have a buff with
long<00:01:28.780> pressed<00:01:29.140> mode<00:01:29.409> enabled<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.340> do<00:01:30.520> have

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
long pressed mode enabled you do have

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.849 
long pressed mode enabled you do have
video<00:01:30.909> settings<00:01:31.329> over<00:01:31.570> here<00:01:31.600> which<00:01:32.560> allows

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
video settings over here which allows

Smile<00:01:36.969> Shutter<00:01:36.999> video<00:01:37.659> we<00:01:37.840> can<00:01:38.020> actually<00:01:38.350> take

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
Smile Shutter video we can actually take

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.289 
Smile Shutter video we can actually take
and<00:01:38.740> let<00:01:39.189> me<00:01:39.340> show<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:39.820> front<00:01:39.969> camera

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
and let me show you the front camera

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.959 
and let me show you the front camera
quality<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.859> this<00:01:42.159> is<00:01:42.280> how<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.460> front<00:01:42.759> camera

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
quality so this is how the front camera

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.700 
quality so this is how the front camera
quality<00:01:43.569> will<00:01:43.689> look<00:01:43.780> like<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.109> front<00:01:44.289> camera

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
quality will look like the front camera

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.279 
quality will look like the front camera
is<00:01:44.740> VGA<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.149> not<00:01:46.450> at<00:01:46.630> all<00:01:46.749> good<00:01:47.079> for

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
is VGA and it is not at all good for

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.319 
is VGA and it is not at all good for
video<00:01:47.439> chat<00:01:47.770> as<00:01:47.950> you<00:01:48.069> can<00:01:48.219> see<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.030> showing

seen<00:01:52.179> other<00:01:52.390> devices<00:01:52.719> on<00:01:53.049> which<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.380> front

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
seen other devices on which the front

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.919 
seen other devices on which the front
camera<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.039> much<00:01:54.460> better<00:01:54.670> than<00:01:54.969> this<00:01:55.119> one<00:01:55.299> that

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
camera is much better than this one that

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.080 
camera is much better than this one that
is<00:01:56.109> something<00:01:56.409> I<00:01:56.530> can<00:01:56.710> say<00:01:56.979> even<00:01:57.159> when<00:01:57.639> they

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
is something I can say even when they

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.209 
is something I can say even when they
are<00:01:58.270> much<00:01:58.659> lower<00:01:59.409> in<00:01:59.530> terms<00:01:59.889> of<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.009> price

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
are much lower in terms of the price

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.399 
are much lower in terms of the price
compared<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:00.969> one<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.810> front<00:02:02.200> camera

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
compared to this one so the front camera

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.080 
compared to this one so the front camera
is<00:02:02.619> very<00:02:02.920> much<00:02:03.159> disappointing<00:02:03.789> on<00:02:03.909> this

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
is very much disappointing on this

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.999 
is very much disappointing on this
device<00:02:04.359> and<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:04.960> cannot<00:02:05.380> do<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> very<00:02:05.950> good

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
device and you cannot do a very good

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.999 
device and you cannot do a very good
quality<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.579> video<00:02:06.759> chart<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:08.350> average

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
quality of video chart very average

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.040 
quality of video chart very average
quality<00:02:09.910> video<00:02:10.090> chat<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.569> be<00:02:10.720> done<00:02:10.899> and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
quality video chat can be done and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.100 
quality video chat can be done and
everything<00:02:11.740> will<00:02:11.950> appear<00:02:12.550> dark<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.510> don't<00:02:14.020> know

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
everything will appear dark I don't know

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.260 
everything will appear dark I don't know
for<00:02:14.290> what<00:02:14.440> reason<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.580> VG<00:02:15.940> camera

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
for what reason but it is a VG camera

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.240 
for what reason but it is a VG camera
you<00:02:16.420> can't<00:02:16.630> expect<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.950> overall

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
you can't expect much but the overall

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.010 
you can't expect much but the overall
quality<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.790> front<00:02:19.060> camera<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.450> not<00:02:19.720> all

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020
