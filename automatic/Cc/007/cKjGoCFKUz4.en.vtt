00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the team and just this the whole

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
the team and just this the whole
atmosphere<00:01:41.910> seemed<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.660> cool<00:01:42.900> now<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.650> be

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
atmosphere seemed really cool now to be

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.790 
atmosphere seemed really cool now to be
a<00:01:43.800> part<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> its<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:45.240> crazy<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.800> think

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
a part of its it's pretty crazy I think

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.410

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
as far as pressure goes you know from
the<00:01:48.570> outside<00:01:49.200> looking<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.650> think<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> lot<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the outside looking in I think a lot of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
the outside looking in I think a lot of
people<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.550> like<00:01:50.700> once<00:01:51.000> you're<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.170> Honda

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
people think like once you're on Honda

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
people think like once you're on Honda
it's<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.040> pressure<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it's like you have all this pressure to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
it's like you have all this pressure to
go<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.330> win<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:55.229> me<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.530> really

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
go out and win and for me I don't really

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.900 
go out and win and for me I don't really
feel<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.920> pressure<00:01:56.160> especially<00:01:56.520> now

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
feel that pressure especially now

working with the guys and I feel like

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.410 
working with the guys and I feel like
there's<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.160> be<00:01:59.220> pressure<00:01:59.550> from<00:02:00.270> myself

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.530 

I<00:02:36.300> think<00:02:37.300> growing<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.599> in<00:02:37.720> Iowa<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.560> know<00:02:38.620> it's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
I think growing up in Iowa you know it's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.089 
I think growing up in Iowa you know it's
not<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:40.750> common<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.260> guess<00:02:41.440> coming<00:02:41.680> from<00:02:41.890> there

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
not as common I guess coming from there

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.370 
not as common I guess coming from there
and<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.610> be<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:43.060> motorcycle<00:02:43.780> racer<00:02:44.020> let<00:02:44.200> alone

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
and to be a motorcycle racer let alone

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.580 
and to be a motorcycle racer let alone
make<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.160> team<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.670> factory<00:02:46.090> Honda<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
make it to a team like factory Honda so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.930 
make it to a team like factory Honda so
