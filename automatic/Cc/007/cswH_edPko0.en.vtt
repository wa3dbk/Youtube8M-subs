and now we have closer view of this

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.260 
and now we have closer view of this
shock<00:01:51.869> absorber<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.640> this<00:01:54.880> front

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
shock absorber and here is this front

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.940 
shock absorber and here is this front
tire<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.989> when<00:01:56.890> we<00:01:57.099> look<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:59.200> shock

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
tire and when we look this this shock

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.589 
tire and when we look this this shock
absorber<00:02:01.080> system<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:02.890> write<00:02:03.099> the<00:02:03.550> way<00:02:03.759> see

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
absorber system we can write the way see

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.559 
absorber system we can write the way see
to<00:02:05.200> damage<00:02:05.739> in<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.660> chalk<00:02:07.660> first<00:02:08.259> if<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:09.429> can

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
to damage in this chalk first if you can

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.940 
to damage in this chalk first if you can
see<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:11.260> kind<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.709> oil<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:13.599> is<00:02:13.660> bad<00:02:14.140> signal

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
see that kind of oil it is bad signal

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
see that kind of oil it is bad signal
because<00:02:15.430> then<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:16.450> chalk<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.200> leaking<00:02:18.010> oil

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
because then this chalk is leaking oil

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.020 
because then this chalk is leaking oil
because<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.689> chalk<00:02:20.110> inside<00:02:21.069> area<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.670> full

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
because this chalk inside area is full

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.640 
because this chalk inside area is full
of<00:02:22.060> press<00:02:22.810> read

press<00:02:24.159> red<00:02:24.519> oil<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.329> then<00:02:25.959> second<00:02:26.500> point<00:02:27.099> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
press red oil and then second point is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.899 
press red oil and then second point is
that<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.920> Tier<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.420> also<00:02:31.689> this

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
that that in Tier we can see also this

chalk<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.019> damaged<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.099> this<00:02:39.640> oil<00:02:39.819> comes<00:02:40.780> I

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
chalk is damaged and this oil comes I

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.780 
chalk is damaged and this oil comes I
think<00:02:41.109> that<00:02:41.680> in<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.989> piston<00:02:44.620> seal<00:02:45.519> are

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
think that in in in this piston seal are

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.819 
think that in in in this piston seal are
a<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.299> pissed<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:46.930> metallic<00:02:47.140> button

a this is pissed on this metallic button

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.500 
a this is pissed on this metallic button
and<00:02:48.099> then<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.849> this<00:02:49.810> correct<00:02:50.739> area<00:02:51.310> see<00:02:52.299> this

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.550 
damaged and of course we need to look
what<00:03:58.349> what<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.620> that<00:04:00.659> okay<00:04:01.659> and<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.349> not

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
what what is that okay and and not

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.750 
what what is that okay and and not
damage<00:04:03.239> shock<00:04:04.239> absorber<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:05.979> go<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.400> look

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
damage shock absorber and we go to look

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.170 
damage shock absorber and we go to look
in<00:04:07.030> other<00:04:07.599> side<00:04:08.199> because<00:04:08.650> there<00:04:08.889> is<00:04:09.120> there<00:04:10.120> is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
in other side because there is there is

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.119 
in other side because there is there is
a<00:04:10.329> fine<00:04:10.959> joke<00:04:11.500> observer<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.370> let's<00:04:12.639> look<00:04:12.879> that

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
a fine joke observer and let's look that

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.020 
a fine joke observer and let's look that
next

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.690 

okay<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.239> next<00:04:19.419> we<00:04:19.750> are<00:04:19.780> looking<00:04:20.230> at<00:04:20.530> this

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
okay and next we are looking at this

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.580 
okay and next we are looking at this
this<00:04:21.700> okay<00:04:22.300> shock<00:04:22.900> absorber<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.510> what<00:04:25.510> we<00:04:25.810> can

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
this okay shock absorber and what we can

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.580 
this okay shock absorber and what we can
see<00:04:26.860> right<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.340> way<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.150> very<00:04:28.870> clean

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
see right the way this is very clean

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.360 
see right the way this is very clean
there<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.070> no<00:04:30.280> any<00:04:30.520> oily<00:04:31.200> button<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:33.040> when

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
there is no any oily button and and when

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.260 
there is no any oily button and and when
we<00:04:33.730> check<00:04:34.389> this<00:04:34.630> upper<00:04:35.050> area<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.590> a

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
we check this upper area it is a it is a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.980 
we check this upper area it is a it is a
this<00:04:40.470> rubber<00:04:41.470> is<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:45.250> okay<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.480> not<00:04:46.660> broken

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
this rubber is is okay it is not broken

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.650 
this rubber is is okay it is not broken
man<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.770> then<00:04:48.280> when<00:04:48.490> we<00:04:48.700> look<00:04:48.970> in<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.419> area

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
man and then when we look in that area

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.500 
man and then when we look in that area
there<00:04:50.200> is<00:04:50.320> no<00:04:50.830> any<00:04:51.190> any<00:04:52.150> oil<00:04:52.960> leaks<00:04:53.940> in<00:04:54.940> in<00:04:55.270> that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
there is no any any oil leaks in in that

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.330 
there is no any any oil leaks in in that
area<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.950> explicitly<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.690> point<00:04:59.340> else

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
this is like good and okay shock

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.760 
this is like good and okay shock
absorber<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.930> this<00:05:13.930> coil<00:05:14.290> spring

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
absorber and this this coil spring

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
that kind of coil spring okay and this

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.860 
that kind of coil spring okay and this
was<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.320> information<00:05:23.620> how<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.610> got<00:05:24.880> how<00:05:25.810> you

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
absorber is damaged and there's leaks

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.280 
absorber is damaged and there's leaks
okay<00:05:34.600> thank<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.229> for<00:05:35.590> watching
