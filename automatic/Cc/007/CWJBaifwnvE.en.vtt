00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
this is angled in such a way that if you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
this is angled in such a way that if you
wear<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:26.250> doesn't<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.119> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
wear it it doesn't get in the way of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
wear it it doesn't get in the way of
cycling<00:01:27.990> motion<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.650> angle<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> points

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
cycling motion with angle and points

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.499 
cycling motion with angle and points
away<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.409> your<00:01:31.640> from<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.850> from<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.210> legs

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
away from your from your from your legs

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.929 
away from your from your from your legs
so<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.310> each<00:01:35.430> side<00:01:35.460> one

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so there I have two on each side one

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
so there I have two on each side one
each<00:01:36.119> side<00:01:36.360> rather<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> run<00:01:37.950> your

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
each side rather and so you can run your

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
each side rather and so you can run your
D<00:01:38.189> lock<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:39.380> or<00:01:40.380> some<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.799> our

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
patches on the other side on the back of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.310 
patches on the other side on the back of
the<00:01:45.630> boat<00:01:46.189> we<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.630> some<00:01:48.630> clipping<00:01:49.049> webbing
