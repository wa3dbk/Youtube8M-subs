00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.100
 of the video for more information and now 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.569
 everyone I reef if today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.010
 I bring you the first demonstration of 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.010
 strength on yale 2 anniversary 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 well maybe not many of banesto but 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.730
 I in Gilo 3 be a passionate strong 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.560
 really one of my activities 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.869
 favorites and what I consumed the most 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.520
 playing time was mapping between 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.200
 three several of my game types and a 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.599
 map came out in bonn gym favorites is 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.430
 then I'm talking about makes and three 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.810
 years a little over three years 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 tools back then were very 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.710
 limited but ultimately you could 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.630
 achieve great things in halo 3 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 the gueiler rising portion and what 4 have 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.370
 markedly improved since then 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 but now in halo 2 anniversary twyford 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 industries suite did not disappoint with what 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.770
 that showed this time simply the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 possibilities in force are immense 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.730
 we have the ability to handle blocks 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.770
 large land to do our 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
 own play space I want to highlight 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.400
 that what we are seeing is only one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.740
 of the three maps that both will be 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.019
 in achievements and bersuit maps totally 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.970
 gaps dedicated exclusively to the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.950
 game we can equally use 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.509
 our force natural objects like 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.460
 trees and rocks thing that we had already 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.470
 seen in halo 4 but now to higher 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 scale and improvement on ice 2 anniversary 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.740
 everything you are looking at 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.049
 then it was created only in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
 fort this is not an island that already existed 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.090
 and the island was created in the same 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.369
 using the palettes of objects that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 the scenarios come for us 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.229
 introduce even more aesthetic objects and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.130
 even more possibilities for portal and as 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.050
 this field inhibitor 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.450
 electromagnetic controlled by a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.640
 switch that we can position 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.440
 on the map the new switches are going to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 serve a lot since these are going to 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.409
 change the gameplay so 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.729
 extraordinary as you do not know what 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.229
 imagine one and what else I 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.390
 excited to see now is creativity 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.250
 of people what kind of things are going to 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 create with this what kind of maps and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.090
 types of new games we're going to have 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.770
 to play angela 2 anniversary if the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.140
 possibilities arrive great with heller 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.149
 and stealth 4 are now even bigger 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.729
 we have more possibilities to modify 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.350
 the gameplay the scenarios and even the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.759
 vehicles how can you tell here 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.100
 there is the magic used by the heretics 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.630
 in the halo campaign 2 personally a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.630
 aesthetic touch that I loved to me 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.200
 I want to win you with him I believe in the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.950
 heart of the letters and my faith I 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.950
 reward 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.610
 one of the things that I also notice in the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.860
 objects is that they have different texture 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.750
 as they realize the texture of these 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.640
 objects are stones while 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.470
 we have the same objects in halo 4 in 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.150
 metal shape this makes me wonder if 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.430
 they will also give us the option to change 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.470
 the skins of objects the form or ns 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.360
 you eat so much that you can not give 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.130
 consider the possibility of recreating maps 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 now it's quite big and the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.910
 infractions with objects are now 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.440
 possible thanks to this new mode of 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.480
 because I do not know about you but all these 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.670
 changes are definitely going to make 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190
 is playing halo 2 aniversaria force 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.960
 much of my time good I just 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.580
 I'm telling you, go figure out the guys 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.920
 of game and maps that you will create 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.320
 for the community in truth this we 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.540
 It makes me very anxious and I want to play that 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.030
 house redesign maps and create 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.130
 maps for the community is the pink what 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.900
 who missed too much 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.160

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.110
