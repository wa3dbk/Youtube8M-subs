you okay this is the old cd-rom the
laser<00:01:19.439> itself<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.960> thought<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.409> dirty

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
laser itself I thought it was just dirty

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.950 
laser itself I thought it was just dirty
I<00:01:22.860> tried<00:01:23.130> cleaning<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.540> clean<00:01:24.780> it

you usually take a little bit alcohol
put<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> q-tip<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> clean<00:01:29.340> your

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
put it on a q-tip and you clean your

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.910 
put it on a q-tip and you clean your
laser<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.700> huncles<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.990> rub<00:01:34.799> it

over<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> laser<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> little

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
over the laser actually have a little

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.140 
over the laser actually have a little
bit<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:38.960> alcohol<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> tried<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
bit of alcohol in it well I tried that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
bit of alcohol in it well I tried that
several<00:01:42.570> times<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.049> wouldn't<00:01:43.350> work<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
several times it wouldn't work it it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
several times it wouldn't work it it
would<00:01:44.460> work<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.149> soon<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> disc<00:01:46.110> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
would work as soon as I put the disc in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.609 
would work as soon as I put the disc in
and<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> close<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.579> death<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.229> tray<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
and when I close to death the tray the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.149 
and when I close to death the tray the
disc<00:01:52.619> would<00:01:52.860> read<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.540> minute<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
disc would read for a minute and then it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.850 
disc would read for a minute and then it
would<00:01:56.399> stop<00:01:56.610> reading<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.960> told<00:01:58.590> me<00:01:58.710> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
would stop reading that told me that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.310 
would stop reading that told me that
there<00:01:59.009> are<00:01:59.219> small<00:01:59.969> scratches<00:02:01.219> on<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.750> lens

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
there are small scratches on the lens

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490 
there are small scratches on the lens
for<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> laser<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.450> problem<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
for the laser and the problem was the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.420 
for the laser and the problem was the
alcohol<00:02:08.000> while<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> was<00:02:09.330> wet<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
alcohol while it was wet on there and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.790 
alcohol while it was wet on there and
filling<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
filling it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.970 
filling it
cracks<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.850> scratches<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.860> would

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
cracks and the scratches and it would

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.100 
cracks and the scratches and it would
amount<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.340> read<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.240> got<00:02:17.480> me<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.750> thinking

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
amount to read so I got me to thinking

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.780 
amount to read so I got me to thinking
you<00:02:18.260> know<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.410> don't<00:02:18.680> want<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.490> know<00:02:19.610> this

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
you know I don't want to you know this

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.610 
you know I don't want to you know this
is<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> very<00:02:20.120> old<00:02:20.540> computer<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:21.020> don't<00:02:21.260> want<00:02:21.440> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
is a very old computer I don't want to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.060

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
which as you can see it it's not real

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.950 
which as you can see it it's not real
bad<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.310> know<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:45.880> loads<00:04:46.180> up<00:04:46.420> fairly<00:04:46.780> quick

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
bad you know it loads up fairly quick

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.910 
bad you know it loads up fairly quick
for<00:04:49.960> example<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.710> want<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:52.230> go<00:04:53.230> into<00:04:53.440> my

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
for example if I want to go into my

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.600 
for example if I want to go into my
gmail<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:56.020> know<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.170> just<00:04:56.470> clicked<00:04:57.100> on<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.490> and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
gmail you know I just clicked on it and

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.659 
gmail you know I just clicked on it and
there<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.390> is

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
there it is

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.970 
there it is
see<00:05:00.669> that's<00:05:01.350> it's<00:05:02.350> not<00:05:02.530> bad<00:05:03.540> for<00:05:04.830> an<00:05:05.830> old

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
see that's it's not bad for an old

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.290 
see that's it's not bad for an old
computer<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.400> really<00:05:06.820> wouldn't<00:05:07.090> hardly

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
computer that really wouldn't hardly

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.760 
computer that really wouldn't hardly
work<00:05:07.950> now<00:05:08.950> my<00:05:09.250> next<00:05:09.490> step<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.690> as<00:05:11.320> you<00:05:11.620> can

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
work now my next step is this as you can

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
it's not as easy to get off if I thought

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.400
