 Serov closely okay chop 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:44.069
 cucumber is enough so that they do not glass 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:45.750

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.959

 happened while we were cooking mushrooms 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.020
 A little bit with the camera problems in general 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.900
 the pot is so big and in which we 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.479

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.440
 like everything but no two chicken thighs 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.370
 or rather 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.210
 the meat that came out of it said 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.570
 that chicken thighs are more juicy than 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.160
 than fillet 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:14.000
 so they used chicken thighs 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:18.570

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.820

 we salted them peppers they do not squash 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:35.400
 because they are already fried and 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:40.260
 add to them there now we 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:44.060
