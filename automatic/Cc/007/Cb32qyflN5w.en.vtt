00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
his channel and it's probably going to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.800 
his channel and it's probably going to
be<00:01:37.290> short<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> video<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:39.240> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.570> the

be short of video you want to see the
videos<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.409> check<00:01:40.619> his<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> man

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
videos you go check his out is a man

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.139 
videos you go check his out is a man
anyways<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> let's<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> look<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.030> we

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
anyways so let's have a look at what we

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.960 
anyways so let's have a look at what we
have<00:01:45.329> inside<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.399> think<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:47.520> might<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.700> like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
have inside I think there might be like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.100 
have inside I think there might be like
a<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> plastic<00:01:50.070> girl<00:01:50.520> whatever<00:01:51.420> playmat

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a like a plastic girl whatever playmat

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830 
a like a plastic girl whatever playmat
in<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.579> looks<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.970> got<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> rules<00:01:54.540> if

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
in here looks like it's got the rules if

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.499 
in here looks like it's got the rules if
they<00:01:54.960> always<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.649> version<00:01:56.549> 3<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> rules

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
they always do version 3 of the rules

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.539 
they always do version 3 of the rules
let's<00:01:57.840> turn<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.079> page<00:01:58.640> 394<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:01.399> wink<00:02:02.399> to

such<00:05:01.210> as<00:05:01.330> requisite<00:05:01.659> but<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.860> have<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.099> flip<00:05:03.219> a

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
such as requisite but you have to flip a

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.920 
such as requisite but you have to flip a
coin<00:05:03.669> after<00:05:04.029> you<00:05:04.090> use<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.449> if<00:05:04.509> its<00:05:04.659> tail's

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
coin after you use it and if its tail's

you<00:05:05.710> can't<00:05:05.919> use<00:05:06.129> it<00:05:06.250> again<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.580> next<00:05:06.610> turn<00:05:07.000> so

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
you can't use it again the next turn so

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.749 
you can't use it again the next turn so
that<00:05:07.930> can<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.139> problematic<00:05:08.759> understandably
