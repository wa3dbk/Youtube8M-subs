not sure what this does I think it makes
it<00:02:13.400> more

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
it more

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.190 
it more
for<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:15.019> obviously<00:02:15.469> Romanian<00:02:16.069> mo<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
for this is obviously Romanian mo and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.309 
for this is obviously Romanian mo and
you<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:18.349> also<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.159> shields<00:02:20.109> this<00:02:21.109> is

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
you can also get like shields this is

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.410 
you can also get like shields this is
basically<00:02:22.189> the<00:02:22.370> shield<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.849> will<00:02:22.969> never<00:02:23.209> die

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
basically the shield you will never die

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.050 
basically the shield you will never die
so<00:02:24.379> you<00:02:24.469> get<00:02:24.680> copy<00:02:25.129> that<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.989> items<00:02:28.060> insert

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
so you get copy that go to items insert

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.670 
so you get copy that go to items insert
from<00:02:29.359> clipboard<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.019> it's<00:02:30.409> could<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
from clipboard and it's could the
