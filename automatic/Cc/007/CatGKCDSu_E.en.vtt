00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
easy because it's cheap and we get a lot

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
easy because it's cheap and we get a lot
of<00:01:04.949> ammo<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.420> purchase<00:01:06.750> the

other<00:01:07.200> weapons<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.180> recommend

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
other weapons but I don't recommend

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
other weapons but I don't recommend
doing<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.350> they're<00:01:10.530> expensive<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
doing so because they're expensive and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.289 
doing so because they're expensive and
the<00:01:11.460> ammo<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.630> quite<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> lot<00:01:14.000> right<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.150> the

of<00:01:46.229> course<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.799> powerful<00:01:48.470> you'll<00:01:49.470> also

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
of course it's more powerful you'll also

those<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> destroyed<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
those can be destroyed just like that

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.650 
those can be destroyed just like that
just<00:02:07.469> by<00:02:07.560> shooting<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:09.239> other<00:02:09.390> ones

kill these two you'll notice that the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.940 
kill these two you'll notice that the
sound<00:02:20.690> effects<00:02:21.020> seem<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.230> be<00:02:21.440> borrowed<00:02:21.739> from

as explosions when I played back in the
day<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:27.500> version<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.160> game<00:02:28.310> did<00:02:28.489> not<00:02:28.520> have

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
day my version of the game did not have

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.130 
day my version of the game did not have
sound<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.600> pretty<00:02:29.780> much<00:02:29.870> had<00:02:30.110> to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
sound at all so we pretty much had to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
sound at all so we pretty much had to
play<00:02:30.319> in<00:02:30.380> silence<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:32.690> here<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.200> extra

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
play in silence this here is extra

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.120

pretty<00:02:37.340> much<00:02:37.519> goes<00:02:37.730> through<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> roof<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
pretty much goes through the roof the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.380 
pretty much goes through the roof the
good<00:02:40.190> thing<00:02:40.340> about<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.640> game<00:02:40.760> was<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.269> was

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
good thing about this game was it was

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.600 
good thing about this game was it was
relatively<00:02:41.930> small<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:43.190> could<00:02:43.340> easily

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
relatively small so you could easily

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.150 
relatively small so you could easily
sneak<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.209> onto<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> work<00:02:44.720> PC<00:02:45.140> or<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> school<00:02:45.830> PC

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
sneak it onto a work PC or a school PC

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.120 
sneak it onto a work PC or a school PC

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
have to admit lies within two-player

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:04.570 
have to admit lies within two-player
mode<00:03:02.920> when<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:03.980> go<00:03:04.069> ahead<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.310> pull<00:03:04.459> up<00:03:04.549> the

dot I believe is the exit if memory
serves<00:03:09.170> correctly<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:14.420> we're<00:03:14.540> gonna<00:03:14.630> go<00:03:14.780> ahead

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
serves correctly so we're gonna go ahead

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.229 
serves correctly so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:03:15.049> make<00:03:15.140> our<00:03:15.290> way<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.799> exit<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.549> believe<00:03:17.120> I

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
and make our way to the exit I believe I

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.270 
and make our way to the exit I believe I
have<00:03:17.390> one<00:03:17.570> more<00:03:17.690> item<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.170> collect<00:03:18.530> hopefully

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
have one more item to collect hopefully

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.390 
have one more item to collect hopefully
it'll<00:03:19.489> be<00:03:19.640> along<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> way<00:03:24.100> now<00:03:25.100> as<00:03:25.250> I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
it'll be along the way now as I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.220 
it'll be along the way now as I
mentioned<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.910> can<00:03:25.940> destroy<00:03:26.420> all<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.900> boxes

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
well no it is complete so we're gonna

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.840 
well no it is complete so we're gonna
jump<00:03:37.579> into<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.910> exit<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:40.100> me<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.250> always

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
jump into the exit and to me that always

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.490 
jump into the exit and to me that always
looks<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.180> sewer<00:03:41.450> grate<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:42.109> I<00:03:42.140> can<00:03:42.320> see

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
looks like a sewer grate but I can see

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.470 
looks like a sewer grate but I can see
what<00:03:42.620> they're<00:03:42.769> aiming<00:03:42.890> for<00:03:43.280> Laser<00:03:43.880> doors<00:03:44.209> or

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
whatnot once we jump in we get a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.229 
whatnot once we jump in we get a
breakdown<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.310> what<00:03:49.670> we<00:03:49.790> did<00:03:49.910> through<00:03:50.209> the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
destroying everything but I think the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920 
destroying everything but I think the
bonus<00:04:13.250> from<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.459> deadline<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.209> worth<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.750> lot

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
more time on the deadline but they also

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.390

throw<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.870> another<00:04:31.290> enemy<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.920> he's<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.190> bit

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
throw in another enemy and he's a bit

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.010 
throw in another enemy and he's a bit
stronger<00:04:32.730> than<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.030> first<00:04:33.420> guy<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.840> red

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
stronger than the first guy with red

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.290 
stronger than the first guy with red
eyes<00:04:34.230> but<00:04:35.010> there's<00:04:35.370> not<00:04:35.550> too<00:04:35.790> many<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.150> them

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
eyes but there's not too many of them

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.970 
eyes but there's not too many of them
and<00:04:36.540> they're<00:04:36.900> still<00:04:37.110> fairly<00:04:37.260> easy<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.710> take

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
and they're still fairly easy to take

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.930 
and they're still fairly easy to take
out<00:04:39.110> because<00:04:40.110> there<00:04:40.530> are<00:04:40.650> new<00:04:40.830> enemies<00:04:41.190> we

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
out because there are new enemies we

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.910 
out because there are new enemies we
could<00:04:42.270> pick<00:04:42.540> up<00:04:42.660> more<00:04:43.020> ammo<00:04:43.380> for<00:04:43.620> our<00:04:43.710> power

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
could pick up more ammo for our power

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.180 
could pick up more ammo for our power
gun<00:04:44.160> just<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.670> case<00:04:45.230> but<00:04:46.230> that's<00:04:46.860> pretty<00:04:47.070> much

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
gun just in case but that's pretty much

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.710 
gun just in case but that's pretty much
where<00:04:47.490> I'm<00:04:47.550> gonna<00:04:47.700> end<00:04:47.880> it's<00:04:48.090> because<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:48.570> don't

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
where I'm gonna end it's because I don't
