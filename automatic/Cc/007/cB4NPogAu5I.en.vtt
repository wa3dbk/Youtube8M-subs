00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.990 
it at the three inch mark and then I
bring<00:01:18.460> my<00:01:18.640> laid<00:01:19.329> back<00:01:19.600> cut<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.520> that's<00:01:21.670> my

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
three inch square now suppose you get

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.620 
three inch square now suppose you get
the<00:01:26.619> instructions<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.340> say<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.450> need<00:01:28.600> to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
cut something two and three quarters

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.370 
cut something two and three quarters
across<00:01:30.840> by<00:01:31.840> one<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.560> seven-eighths<00:01:33.009> down<00:01:34.380> so

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
across by one and seven-eighths down so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.830 
across by one and seven-eighths down so
this<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.890> where<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.130> math<00:01:36.340> comes<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.969> so<00:01:37.780> two

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
this is where the math comes in so two

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.740 
this is where the math comes in so two
and<00:01:38.229> three<00:01:38.409> quarters<00:01:38.860> would<00:01:39.280> be<00:01:39.520> at<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.450> line

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
and three quarters would be at this line

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.410 
and three quarters would be at this line
right<00:01:41.020> here<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:42.759> going<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.939> slide<00:01:43.240> that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
right here so I'm going to slide that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.459 
right here so I'm going to slide that
across<00:01:43.780> at<00:01:44.200> two<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:44.799> three<00:01:44.950> quarters<00:01:46.469> bring

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
across at two and three quarters bring

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.249 
across at two and three quarters bring
my<00:01:47.619> blade<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.219> cut<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.780> take<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.899> excess

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
my blade and cut it take the excess

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.560 
my blade and cut it take the excess
paper<00:01:50.530> aside<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.579> I've<00:01:51.670> got<00:01:51.880> my<00:01:52.030> two<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.390> three

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
paper aside so I've got my two and three

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.380 
paper aside so I've got my two and three
quarters<00:01:52.899> across<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.590> turn<00:01:53.979> my<00:01:54.159> paper<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.359> that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
quarters across I turn my paper so that

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.169 
quarters across I turn my paper so that
I<00:01:55.570> can<00:01:55.780> now<00:01:55.990> get<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.789> seven<00:01:58.149> eight<00:01:58.329> well

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
I can now get one in seven eight well

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.910 
I can now get one in seven eight well
here's<00:02:01.179> one<00:02:01.539> inch<00:02:01.780> mark<00:02:02.109> and<00:02:02.380> here's<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.619> two

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
here's one inch mark and here's a two

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.510 
here's one inch mark and here's a two
inch<00:02:03.130> mark<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:04.179> we<00:02:04.359> know<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.950> is<00:02:06.009> where<00:02:06.490> we

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
inch mark so we know this is where we

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.570 
inch mark so we know this is where we
get<00:02:06.909> into<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.299> sixteenth<00:02:07.980> increments<00:02:08.980> and<00:02:09.190> so

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
get into the sixteenth increments and so

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.220 
get into the sixteenth increments and so
we<00:02:09.790> have<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.150> figure

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
we have to figure

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.440 
we have to figure
seven<00:02:12.980> eighths<00:02:13.160> its<00:02:13.459> equal<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.879> fourteen

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
seven eighths its equal to fourteen

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.890 
seven eighths its equal to fourteen
sixteen<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:16.459> we<00:02:17.209> know<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.900> 1<00:02:18.860> inch<00:02:19.129> this<00:02:19.900> is

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
sixteen and we know that 1 inch this is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.210 
sixteen and we know that 1 inch this is
the<00:02:21.230> 3/4<00:02:21.860> mark<00:02:22.040> 1<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.519> 3/4<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:25.400> would<00:02:25.640> be

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
the 3/4 mark 1 in 3/4 and this would be

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.110 
the 3/4 mark 1 in 3/4 and this would be
7/8<00:02:28.220> because<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.599> two<00:02:30.230> inch<00:02:30.440> mark<00:02:30.739> is<00:02:31.010> 16<00:02:31.550> 16

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
7/8 because this two inch mark is 16 16

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.990 
7/8 because this two inch mark is 16 16
which<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.420> an<00:02:32.690> inch<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:34.010> know<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.610> two

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
which is an inch and we know that two

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.080 
which is an inch and we know that two
ticks<00:02:35.269> back<00:02:35.599> 16<00:02:36.290> 16<00:02:36.709> would<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:37.010> 14<00:02:37.430> 16<00:02:37.849> which<00:02:38.060> is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
ticks back 16 16 would be 14 16 which is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.570 
ticks back 16 16 would be 14 16 which is
the<00:02:38.269> same<00:02:38.569> as<00:02:38.720> 7<00:02:38.930> 8<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.680> align<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.280> right

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
the same as 7 8 so we align that right

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.740 
the same as 7 8 so we align that right
there<00:02:40.819> at<00:02:40.910> 7<00:02:41.269> 8<00:02:43.090> take<00:02:44.090> our<00:02:44.299> blade<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.930> cut

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
there at 7 8 take our blade and we cut

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.630 
there at 7 8 take our blade and we cut
and<00:02:47.750> now<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:47.989> have<00:02:48.380> 2<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.549> 3/4<00:02:50.060> across<00:02:50.890> by<00:02:51.890> 1

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and now we have 2 and 3/4 across by 1

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.940 
and now we have 2 and 3/4 across by 1
and<00:02:52.819> 7/8<00:02:53.360> inch<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.079> you<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.530> double<00:02:54.920> check

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
and 7/8 inch and you can double check

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.729 
and 7/8 inch and you can double check
this<00:02:55.310> by<00:02:55.670> taking<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.660> regular<00:02:56.840> ruler<00:02:57.380> making

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
this by taking a regular ruler making

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.970 
this by taking a regular ruler making
sure<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.099> your<00:02:58.280> measurements<00:02:58.760> were<00:02:58.910> correct
