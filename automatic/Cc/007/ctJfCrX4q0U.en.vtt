a<00:02:28.000> metal<00:02:29.000> tip<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.670> guy's<00:02:31.970> got<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.270> metal<00:02:32.540> tip

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.800 

so<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:36.890> should<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.130> pretty<00:02:37.370> interesting<00:02:37.910> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
so that should be pretty interesting and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.510 
so that should be pretty interesting and
we<00:02:38.960> have<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> original<00:02:39.470> dhaba<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.490> I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.010 
first picked up and then we have a gel
style<00:02:45.850> feels<00:02:46.850> like<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.240> really<00:02:47.480> fast<00:02:47.780> and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
style feels like it's really fast and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.680
