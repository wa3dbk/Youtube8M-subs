00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 it's time 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:12.869
 of this new finished sedan could tell us so many things start at 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.070
 talk about the brand new brand brand was very intelligent 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.179
 because it is proposing common to the new business system 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.609
 but let's talk about cars we start from the useless line perhaps commenting on it 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.529
 like milk under the eyes of everyone but we are seeing it we are looking at it 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.050
 and we are realizing that this machine is actually quite different from the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.550
 other 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 and this is the first one. the most important thing 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 the one that catches the eye but then there are the details, there are so many details 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.450
 because this square meters 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.850
 this great sedan written in competition with virus 5 mercedes e 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.490
 hairstyle with audi a6 of course 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.519
 it is also not built on trait motions 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.839
 on some details found for example in the history of the ben 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.089
 distinguished by the treatment of surfaces with wood with powders 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.399
 silver to highlight tiptronic but also the wood grain in short 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.970
 something unique and exclusive 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.080
 unique but of course not exclusive because there are so many divided and fewer 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.500
 badly that its propeller a propeller v6 3 liters 240 horses are in line with 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.750
 the one that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.469
 the average of luxury sedans 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.109
 macumba sound for example very particular has taken care of the details 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.720
 makes it almost like the noise of gasoline for me at the guide who expresses the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.400
 its best qualities and performances 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.130
 240 horses are compatible with the competition but a fluid pair is one 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 really interesting driving regularity 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.770
 it was also brought to the track, perhaps you know personally I find that the artist 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.880
 Sicilian factor 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.980
 we are so from video game - in reality 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.330
 but it is true that perhaps some things can be tried only in these 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.170
 conditions 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.350
 elaine demonstrated all its class also in this 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.810
 a car that as you can see from the cost chart reddit 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.120
 is loaded with what are today the updates in terms of technologies of 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.999
 most interesting security 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:19.370
 a car that makes driving dynamics a strong point with an opening that makes 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.859
 of this security 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.839
 preventive but also a driving force another strong point in short, the n 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.250
 different can be compared to a TV series 5 maybe 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.939
 this must be judged so much so that this new car 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.339
 may like that it can enter the segment you too interesting price but 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.489
 especially with a ratio of equipment to the 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.730
 competition for which making the sum of its price extremely 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.729
 interesting god 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.559
 world handle
