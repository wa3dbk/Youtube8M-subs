00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
so far we've talked about snaffle bits

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.960 
so far we've talked about snaffle bits
and<00:00:16.810> direct<00:00:17.230> raining<00:00:17.710> well<00:00:18.310> today<00:00:18.700> we're

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
and direct raining well today we're

and direct raining well today we're
going<00:00:19.060> to<00:00:19.150> show<00:00:19.390> you<00:00:19.450> how<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.840> neck<00:00:20.350> rain<00:00:20.650> using

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
going to show you how to neck rain using

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.060 
going to show you how to neck rain using
a<00:00:21.189> kerb<00:00:21.520> it<00:00:21.820> that's<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.600> very<00:00:22.960> very<00:00:23.350> different

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
a kerb it that's a very very different

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.370 
a kerb it that's a very very different
method<00:00:24.580> but<00:00:25.060> it's<00:00:25.210> important<00:00:25.840> that<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:26.020> learn

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380

how to do it and do it well or else

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.330 
how to do it and do it well or else
you're<00:00:28.900> not<00:00:28.930> going<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.320> be<00:00:29.439> able<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.740> tell<00:00:30.099> your

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
horse what direction to go in like with

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.930 
horse what direction to go in like with
so<00:00:34.810> many<00:00:34.840> things<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.950> we<00:00:36.190> teach<00:00:36.400> our<00:00:36.579> horses

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
so many things that we teach our horses

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.170 
so many things that we teach our horses
the<00:00:37.750> fundamental<00:00:38.530> lesson<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.520> move<00:00:39.760> away

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
the fundamental lesson is to move away

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.650 
the fundamental lesson is to move away
from<00:00:40.870> pressure<00:00:41.200> so<00:00:42.160> when<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.059> have<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:43.269> direct

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
from pressure so when you have a direct

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.720 
from pressure so when you have a direct
rain<00:00:43.930> which<00:00:44.230> we've<00:00:44.410> already<00:00:44.590> covered<00:00:44.829> you

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
rain which we've already covered you

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.209 
rain which we've already covered you
pull<00:00:46.059> with<00:00:46.300> one<00:00:46.600> hand<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.620> give<00:00:47.890> with<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
pull with one hand you give with the

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.060 
pull with one hand you give with the
other<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.760> they<00:00:49.300> they<00:00:49.899> release<00:00:50.500> they<00:00:50.829> come

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
other and they they release they come

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.220 
other and they they release they come
away<00:00:51.399> from<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.539> pressure<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:53.019> you're

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
away from the pressure that you're

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.590 
away from the pressure that you're
putting<00:00:53.440> on<00:00:53.620> their<00:00:53.800> mouth<00:00:53.980> when<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:55.090> are<00:00:55.300> neck

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
putting on their mouth when you are neck

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.290 
putting on their mouth when you are neck
reining<00:00:56.230> you<00:00:56.769> can't<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.339> that<00:00:57.579> they<00:00:57.910> have<00:00:58.120> to

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
reining you can't do that they have to

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.270 
reining you can't do that they have to
learn<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.750> move<00:00:58.899> away<00:00:59.079> from<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.589> different<00:00:59.859> kind

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
learn to move away from a different kind

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.500 
learn to move away from a different kind
of<00:01:00.550> pressure<00:01:00.960> neck<00:01:01.960> reining<00:01:02.499> is<00:01:02.649> when<00:01:03.429> you<00:01:04.269> the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
of pressure neck reining is when you the

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.190 
of pressure neck reining is when you the
rider<00:01:04.750> uses<00:01:05.140> one<00:01:05.650> hand<00:01:06.070> with<00:01:06.760> split<00:01:07.180> reins<00:01:07.480> the
