left<00:03:05.930> note<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:08.070> reason<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
left note on this the reason of the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.050 
left note on this the reason of the
original<00:03:09.630> design<00:03:09.959> was<00:03:09.990> like<00:03:10.320> this<00:03:10.470> honeycomb

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
original design was like this honeycomb

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.780 
original design was like this honeycomb
but<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> requested<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.810> grid<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.160> these<00:03:14.580> are

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
but I requested a grid and so these are

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.260 
but I requested a grid and so these are
actually<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.330> here<00:03:15.540> more<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:15.900> less<00:03:16.080> randomly

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
actually in here more or less randomly

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.300 
actually in here more or less randomly
but<00:03:18.270> if<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.810> were<00:03:18.930> me<00:03:19.140> putting<00:03:19.620> them<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:20.100> I

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
but if it were me putting them in I

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.420 
but if it were me putting them in I
would<00:03:21.300> do<00:03:21.480> them<00:03:21.690> by<00:03:21.930> color<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.370> could

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
would do them by color so that I could

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.880 
would do them by color so that I could
find<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.970> specific<00:03:24.209> color<00:03:24.690> really<00:03:24.930> quickly<00:03:25.380> so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
find a specific color really quickly so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.670 
find a specific color really quickly so
for<00:03:26.280> example<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.360> mimics<00:03:27.720> more<00:03:28.530> or

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
for example this this mimics more or

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.170 
for example this this mimics more or
less<00:03:28.830> my<00:03:29.100> old<00:03:29.370> layout<00:03:30.860> back<00:03:31.860> when<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.190> was<00:03:32.550> solo
