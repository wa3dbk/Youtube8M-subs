exhaust off of all five of its hangers
it's<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> good<00:00:39.000> idea<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.420> ahead<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> put

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's a good idea to go ahead and put

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
it's a good idea to go ahead and put
some<00:00:40.079> form<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.379> support<00:00:40.620> strap<00:00:41.100> across<00:00:41.670> the

some form of support strap across the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
some form of support strap across the
forward<00:00:42.480> exhaust<00:00:42.780> tube<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.920> once

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
forward exhaust tube here because once

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.350 
forward exhaust tube here because once
we<00:00:44.219> remove<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> exhaust<00:00:44.760> off<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.030> its<00:00:45.149> hangers

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we remove the exhaust off of its hangers

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360 
we remove the exhaust off of its hangers
the<00:00:45.570> exhaust<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> fall<00:00:46.590> down<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.039> if

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the exhaust is going to fall down and if

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.619 
the exhaust is going to fall down and if
it's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.610> properly<00:00:48.000> supported<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> will

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it's not properly supported it will

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.510 
it's not properly supported it will
damage<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.079> exhaust<00:00:49.350> system<00:00:52.370> okay<00:00:53.370> when

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
damage the exhaust system okay when

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.650 
damage the exhaust system okay when
we're<00:00:53.670> moving<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> exhaust<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> its

we're<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.600> using<00:01:27.840> carriage<00:01:28.110> bolts

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we're going to be using carriage bolts

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
we're going to be using carriage bolts
and<00:01:28.470> blocks<00:01:29.030> at<00:01:30.030> both<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> taxing<00:01:30.750> points<00:01:30.930> and

and blocks at both the taxing points and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.090 
and blocks at both the taxing points and
they're<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.229> different<00:01:31.439> sizes<00:01:31.950> which

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they're actually different sizes which

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.200 
they're actually different sizes which
we'll<00:01:32.220> show<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> minute<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:33.119> going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
we'll show you in a minute we're going

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.640 
we'll show you in a minute we're going

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to need to do is fish these carriage

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.960 
to need to do is fish these carriage
bolts<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> blocks<00:01:35.070> inside<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> frame<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bolts and blocks inside the frame and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.179 
bolts and blocks inside the frame and
pull<00:01:36.299> them<00:01:36.390> down<00:01:36.420> through<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> attaching

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
pull them down through the attaching

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859

holes<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.450> need<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.780> an

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
holes to do that we need to have an

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
holes to do that we need to have an
access<00:01:40.229> point<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.070> time<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.400> our

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
access point at this time there's our

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.710 
access point at this time there's our
large<00:01:41.759> enough<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.270> carriage

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
large enough to get our carriage

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
large enough to get our carriage
building<00:01:42.990> blocks<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.490> we're<00:01:44.610> going

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
building blocks into so what we're going

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100 
building blocks into so what we're going
to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> take<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> forward<00:01:45.840> most<00:01:45.990> mounting

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to do is take the forward most mounting

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
to do is take the forward most mounting
hole<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> drill<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
hole and we're actually going to drill a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690 
hole and we're actually going to drill a
3/8<00:01:48.329> holes<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.780> each<00:01:48.899> side<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.710> enlarge

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
3/8 holes on each side of it and enlarge

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.160 
3/8 holes on each side of it and enlarge
it<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it just a little bit and that's just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.389 
it just a little bit and that's just
enough<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.530> our<00:01:52.649> block<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:52.920> carriage

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
enough to get our block and carriage

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.340 
enough to get our block and carriage
bolt<00:01:53.610> inside<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> frame<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.990> again<00:01:55.229> we're

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
bolt inside the frame and again we're

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.539 
bolt inside the frame and again we're
gonna<00:01:55.439> need<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.040> both<00:01:56.070> sides<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
gonna need to do that on both sides of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
gonna need to do that on both sides of
the<00:01:56.640> vehicle<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> three<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> total
