00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello friends fishing hook fish shop 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 this is another fishing tips know in the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.290
 which will we learn to join the line of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.540
 forest with the booking that comes from 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.019
 reel good then the first thing that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 let's do 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 is to take the fly line 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.170
 and the king bar 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.650
 that we are going to use to join them true 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.280
 then one for one side and the other for 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.280
 opposite side 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.740
 and we used in this case 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.020
 a piece of back in or fiber 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:46.080
 which we are going to fold 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.080
 if it's a normal piece we talk about it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.490
 and how we have here so much the back in 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:59.000
 how the line ends 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:02.420
 we join the three and there is the line 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.530
 the back king and the bent piece of 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.410
 back in or fiber that we are going to use 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.450
 then we take the next king back 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.450
 of our reel and we throw it 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.720
 so to the tip that are the two tips 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.840
 together both the line and the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.840
 mud and we begin to wrap 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.460
 on 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.210
 the three the line the back king and the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.520
 piece of here is not fiber that is going 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 to help now finishes our new 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.100
 then we're going to do five or 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.050
 six laps and for the ojito that we have 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 the fiber fold 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.390
 pajÃ­n that is helping us we put 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.950
 the tip of the back in coming the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.579
 reel if we grab the knot 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.080
 and the piece of fiber beef that 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.860
 we use for this world 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.200
 the poplars what does this 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.420
 little piece we help to put inside 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.030
 the turns and inside the knot that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.160
 We are making the piece of bean kings 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.740
 so they go in a different direction 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.310
 the two ends then we talk to 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.310
 watch out 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.740
 with slowly to avoid damaging the new 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.300
 and it's already out 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.590
 and we squeeze very slowly and ready 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.330
 and here since what do we do 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.700
 then very carefully to the line 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.480
 to go running 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.480
 to the extreme 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.450
 and from there 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.870
 already with help 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.700
 of your fingers or a pliers or something 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.700
 I'm going to help me with a clamp 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.620
 ah 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.620
 what do we do to pull 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.480
 and there we have our knot ready 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.150
 to join the fly line to the parking 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.110
 that comes from the reel and just what 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.720
 what we do is with a knife with a 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.210
 scissors 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 cut 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.560
 the extremes 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.120
 and our last knot is ready 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.970
 I like to do it to take the apothecary 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.600
 Gone crazy to the gnome to give it a little 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.710
 more security 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.090
 and so I have attached the line to the back and 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.260
 this is the knot 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.489
 of the fly fishing tip today 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.459
 reminding them that they crave only store 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.950
 fishing can find many items 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.950
