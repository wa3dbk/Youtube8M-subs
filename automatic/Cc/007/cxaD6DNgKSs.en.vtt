Khalifa<00:00:35.090> theophilus<00:00:36.090> london<00:00:36.170> all<00:00:37.170> started

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
Khalifa theophilus london all started

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.940 
Khalifa theophilus london all started
all<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.370> been<00:00:38.399> seen<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:39.030> wearing<00:00:39.420> his<00:00:39.540> head

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
all have been seen like wearing his head

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.880 
all have been seen like wearing his head
so<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> resale<00:00:42.930> prices<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.559> his<00:00:43.710> head

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so I think the resale prices on his head

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.709 
so I think the resale prices on his head
was<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.250> anywhere<00:00:44.789> from<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.120> two<00:00:45.600> hundred

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
was going anywhere from like two hundred

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
was going anywhere from like two hundred
and<00:00:45.989> thirty<00:00:46.230> dollars<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.980> three<00:00:47.219> hundred

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and thirty dollars to three hundred

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
and thirty dollars to three hundred
dollars<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.550> Johnny<00:00:50.550> decided<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.329> release

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
dollars and Johnny decided to release

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.920 
dollars and Johnny decided to release
the<00:00:52.289> head<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:53.460> his<00:00:53.699> birthday<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.719> think

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the head for his birthday which I think

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.959 
the head for his birthday which I think
was<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> 10th<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> legends<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> februari
