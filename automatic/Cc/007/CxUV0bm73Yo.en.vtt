00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
month but since they already have it I

decided to go ahead and pick one up

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.049 
decided to go ahead and pick one up
because<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.670> awesome

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
because I think it's awesome

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
because I think it's awesome
and<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.079> wanted<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and I really wanted one and I want to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.840 
and I really wanted one and I want to
make<00:00:50.730> sure<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.000> didn't<00:00:51.210> run<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
make sure they didn't run out so this is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.229 
make sure they didn't run out so this is
Robin<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.059> his<00:00:54.480> Redbird<00:00:54.930> cycle<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.789> me<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Robin on his Redbird cycle now to me I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
Robin on his Redbird cycle now to me I
don't<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.109> maybe<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.800> me<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.160> my

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
don't know maybe this is just me but my

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
don't know maybe this is just me but my
first<00:00:59.640> thought<00:00:59.760> when<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> saw<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.629> cycle

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
first thought when I saw this cycle

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.680 
first thought when I saw this cycle
after<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> built<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:03.570> like

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
after I built it was this looks like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410 
after I built it was this looks like
something<00:01:03.989> Harley<00:01:04.470> Quinn<00:01:04.650> would<00:01:04.799> ride<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.420> know

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
something Harley Quinn would ride I know

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
something Harley Quinn would ride I know
maybe<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.170> off<00:01:07.200> base<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.189> just

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
maybe I'm way off base but this just

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.359 
maybe I'm way off base but this just
totally<00:01:09.180> screams<00:01:09.540> Harley<00:01:10.080> Quinn<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> me<00:01:10.650> which

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
totally screams Harley Quinn to me which

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
totally screams Harley Quinn to me which
isn't<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.090> bad<00:01:12.390> thing<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> think

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
isn't really a bad thing because I think

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.920 
isn't really a bad thing because I think
Harley<00:01:13.650> Quinn's<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.159> cool<00:01:14.460> character

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
Harley Quinn's pretty cool character

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
Harley Quinn's pretty cool character
however<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.580> Harley<00:01:17.880> Quinn<00:01:18.060> does<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.360> work

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
however the Harley Quinn does not work

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.770 
however the Harley Quinn does not work
with<00:01:18.750> Robin<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> odd

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
with Robin at all so that's kind of odd

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.969 
with Robin at all so that's kind of odd
but<00:01:22.409> anyway<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> there's<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.409> Robin<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
but anyway and there's your Robin that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.850 
but anyway and there's your Robin that
you<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> new

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you get on here and this is not a new

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.719 
you get on here and this is not a new
Robin<00:01:29.400> at<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:31.530> does<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> two<00:01:32.220> phases

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
Robin at all it does have the two phases

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.859 
Robin at all it does have the two phases
they're<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> cool<00:01:34.619> Cape

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
they're just got the cool Cape

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.770 
they're just got the cool Cape
I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> poly<00:01:37.799> bag<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.780> absolutely

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
I think this poly bag is absolutely

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
I think this poly bag is absolutely
worth<00:01:39.960> getting<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.040> said<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
available from Toys R Us I think it cost

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090 
available from Toys R Us I think it cost
about<00:01:44.460> five<00:01:44.820> dollars<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:46.079> totally<00:01:46.740> worth<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
about five dollars but totally worth it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.910 
about five dollars but totally worth it
because<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.909> awesome<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> anyway<00:01:49.649> I
