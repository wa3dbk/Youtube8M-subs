my third tip is to read food labels and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
my third tip is to read food labels and
compare<00:01:08.250> products<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:09.450> shopping<00:01:09.780> might

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
compare products your shopping might

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
compare products your shopping might
take<00:01:10.260> slightly<00:01:10.619> longer<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> first<00:01:11.400> time<00:01:11.610> but

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
take slightly longer the first time but

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
take slightly longer the first time but
once<00:01:12.119> you've<00:01:12.270> compared<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> products<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
once you've compared to products you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
once you've compared to products you
know<00:01:13.680> exactly<00:01:14.159> which<00:01:14.369> one's<00:01:14.670> better<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
know exactly which one's better for you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
know exactly which one's better for you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I personally always go to the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
I personally always go to the
ingredients<00:01:18.119> list<00:01:18.299> first<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
ingredients list first because then you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140 
ingredients list first because then you
know<00:01:19.500> exactly<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:20.490> putting<00:01:20.880> into

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
calories and rotc teeth so it doesn't

so<00:02:20.820> my<00:02:20.940> fifth<00:02:21.240> tip<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.930> check<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.470> use<00:02:22.710> by

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
so my fifth tip is to check the use by

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.640 
so my fifth tip is to check the use by
dates<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.270> packet<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.900> might<00:02:25.110> say<00:02:25.350> best

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
dates so on a packet it might say best

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.400 
dates so on a packet it might say best
before<00:02:26.040> display<00:02:26.550> until<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.240> use<00:02:27.450> by<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.200> it's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
before display until and use by and it's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.380 
before display until and use by and it's
