00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
then you just unzip the one zipper

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.630 
then you just unzip the one zipper
around<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:10.010> like<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.220> their<00:01:11.430> bags

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640

it uses really strong YKK zips and these

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
laptop and the camera compartment and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.270 
laptop and the camera compartment and
then<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.520> pretty<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.509> doubles<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.140> size<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then it pretty much doubles in size so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
then it pretty much doubles in size so
goes<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:24.000> too<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:24.960> stretched

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
goes out too and that's not stretched

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.770 
goes out too and that's not stretched
that's<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.250> sitting<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.299> that's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
that's just how it's sitting so that's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
that's just how it's sitting so that's
it<00:01:28.049> empty<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.740> expanded<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it empty but expanded and that's it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.260 
it empty but expanded and that's it
packed<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.650> pose<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.820> big

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
packed back down to pose so a big

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.600 
packed back down to pose so a big
difference<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.920> will<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
difference now this one will take a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.060 
difference now this one will take a
fifty<00:01:36.270> no<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.840> takes<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.079> full<00:01:37.290> 17<00:01:37.890> inch

always the first thing to go on a bag
and<00:01:55.170> handles<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.799> guess<00:01:55.950> would<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.219> second<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and handles I guess would be second and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.510 
and handles I guess would be second and
they<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> lifetime<00:01:58.229> guarantee<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:59.219> their

they have a lifetime guarantee on their

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
they have a lifetime guarantee on their
zippers<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.259> built

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
zippers so you know you know it's built

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.190 
zippers so you know you know it's built
to<00:02:01.680> last<00:02:01.829> rather<00:02:02.759> than<00:02:03.119> buy<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> cheap<00:02:03.960> bag

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to last rather than buy a cheap bag

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
to last rather than buy a cheap bag
every<00:02:04.619> year<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.100> two<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.000> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
every year or two you can get one of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
every year or two you can get one of
these<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.840> last<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
these and know it's going to last for a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
these and know it's going to last for a
long<00:02:07.590> time<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.459> are<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.090> good

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
long time they are really really good

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.440 
long time they are really really good
and<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:10.440> one's<00:02:10.679> got<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.129> airflow<00:02:11.730> system<00:02:11.970> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and this one's got an airflow system so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
and this one's got an airflow system so
you've<00:02:12.599> got<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> little

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you've got the little

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.590 
you've got the little
out<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.070> back<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:15.120> that's<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.510> your

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
out on the back so that's for your

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.210 
out on the back so that's for your
shoulder<00:02:15.960> blades<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:16.560> real<00:02:16.740> low<00:02:16.920> back

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
shoulder blades and that's real low back

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.730 
shoulder blades and that's real low back
in<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.550> area<00:02:17.910> allows<00:02:18.150> airflow<00:02:18.870> through<00:02:19.170> now

let's<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.580> close-up<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
let's just have a little close-up on it
