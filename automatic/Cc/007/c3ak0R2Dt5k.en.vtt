00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.389
 q we see that the facts in all the clubs 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.389
 and burgundy I think that three days better is more 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 that's what we are 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.039
 we repeat it a little too often 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.599
 team goes out too often to press because people have taken to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.869
 other clubs where may go 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.690
 so many competitions at this club of lancenet 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.200
 buckwheat the intimacy of the locker room 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 is not to reveal the next day in the feet I do not know too much 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.890
 that they can 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.930
 the voice of sports I do not think 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.820
 so that's what's in itself mostly out 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 but after the summer 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.730
 québec the skirmishes between us 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 it's the life of a cloakroom 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.430
 it's football that is murdered bolloré to your choice 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.790
 close to the journalists 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.230
 winner speaks a lot 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.980
 who is it written who should suffer 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 maybe it does not come out of a player as 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 the idea that echoes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.080
 why men players 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.330
 at that time 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 finally I have no answer for now so equality 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 this patrick captain 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.570
 I do not go further than 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 what all I have to do a lot 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.300
 why this story from the document 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 three investors think the world and everything and everything 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.750
 especially in the imposing hosts a hero a little behind all or 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.860
 people if we like it 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 these little things there that it annoys me 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 this agent 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 in scor positioning 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.890
 small return 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.720
 I am here 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.250
 the show was searching in my little corner 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.149
 I listen 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.480
 I give my opinion 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.580
 in January not when we are in 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.740
 when his uncle given 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.240
 and then I'm lying, I'm getting very young, I'm 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240
 jemaa who are up there percent 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.029
 to say things shout on others no doubt at home 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.339
 jean-marie mosser is no longer a field man I think the locker room 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.779
 for mopti 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 I write all for your evening but a little less antar yahia speakers to 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.169
 through a warm public 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.179
 we talk a little about our country 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.109
 I can say it too 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.429
 what I think 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.629
 55 'it's very good
