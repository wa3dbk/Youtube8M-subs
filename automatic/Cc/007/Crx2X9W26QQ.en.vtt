realized something and I came to a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.459 
realized something and I came to a
realization<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> us<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.200> like

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
realization is that a lot of us we like

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.440 
realization is that a lot of us we like
it<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.370> change<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it when there's not change we like it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
it when there's not change we like it
when<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.629> stay<00:00:40.079> consistent<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.579> have

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
when things stay consistent and we have

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
when things stay consistent and we have
this<00:00:41.969> routine<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:42.960> no<00:00:43.110> really

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
this routine and there's no really

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560 
this routine and there's no really
surprises<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.250> our<00:00:44.370> life<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.420> not

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
surprises in our life and there's not

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.880 
surprises in our life and there's not
really<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.809> much<00:00:45.960> change<00:00:46.410> happening

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
really that much change happening

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
really that much change happening
because<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.460> change<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.180> starts

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
because if there's change then it starts

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
because if there's change then it starts
to<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.780> scary<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.649> we're<00:00:49.890> not

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to get a little bit scary and we're not

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
to get a little bit scary and we're not
sure<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.640> react<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.210> things<00:00:51.390> so

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
sure really how to react to things so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
this whole thing that why people are not

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
this whole thing that why people are not
changing<00:01:00.600> when<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:00.870> should<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.500> this

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
changing when they should be and this

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
changing when they should be and this
whole<00:01:02.100> sense<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:03.149> people<00:01:03.210> aren't

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
whole sense of how people aren't

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
whole sense of how people aren't
changing<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.229> much<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.680> used<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
changing as much as they used to and the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.800 
changing as much as they used to and the
reason<00:01:05.700> why<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.150> thought<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.570> because

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
reason why we thought was because

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
reason why we thought was because
there's<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.260> much<00:01:07.380> distractions<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.310> today's

this where just takes our mind off of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
this where just takes our mind off of
these<00:01:42.479> problems<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.560> when<00:01:43.740> we're<00:01:43.920> done<00:01:44.070> with

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
these problems but when we're done with

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
these problems but when we're done with
these<00:01:44.399> distractions<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.630> back

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
these distractions we just go right back

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
these distractions we just go right back
into<00:01:46.140> these<00:01:46.290> problems<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:48.090> we're

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
into these problems and because we're

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760 
into these problems and because we're
not<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.570> wanting<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> change<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
not really wanting to change and you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
not really wanting to change and you
know<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.070> why<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.520> bad<00:01:50.850> relationships

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
know this is why like bad relationships

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.560 
know this is why like bad relationships
as<00:01:51.720> prolong<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.640> problems<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.119> fixed

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
as prolong or problems don't get fixed

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.630 
as prolong or problems don't get fixed
and<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.680> need<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.219> learn

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and I think that we really need to learn

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
and I think that we really need to learn
that<00:01:56.969> when<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.450> time<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> change<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.439> need<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that when it's time to change we need to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.499 
that when it's time to change we need to
step<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> change<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.880> know<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> be

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
step up and change I know we like to be

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.870 
step up and change I know we like to be
comfortable<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.259> lot<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> times<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.700> it's

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
comfortable a lot of times but it's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.190 
comfortable a lot of times but it's
really<00:02:03.060> important<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.540> know<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:03.990> things

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really important to know when things

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.690 
really important to know when things
need<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.619> done<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.340> world<00:02:05.490> moves

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
need to be done as the world moves

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
need to be done as the world moves
further<00:02:06.180> into<00:02:06.360> technology<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> such<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
further into technology and such you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
further into technology and such you
know<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.280> find<00:02:08.580> ways<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> distract<00:02:09.420> ourselves

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
know we find ways to distract ourselves

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.020

more<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.039> tend<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.640> want<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
