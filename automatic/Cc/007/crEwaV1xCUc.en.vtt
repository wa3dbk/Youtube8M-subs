computer recognized went right into the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
computer recognized went right into the
BIOS<00:02:33.390> changed<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.140> up<00:02:34.290> booted<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:35.070> from

I've only had it for less than a week
and<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.600> most<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.140> newer<00:02:58.320> devices

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
and you know most of the newer devices

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.670 
and you know most of the newer devices
do<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.460> glossy<00:03:00.120> mirrored<00:03:01.110> finish<00:03:01.440> on

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
which kind of makes it a big dust magnet

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.260 
which kind of makes it a big dust magnet
not<00:03:04.860> really<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> negative<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.850> doesn't<00:03:06.090> make<00:03:06.240> it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
not really a negative it doesn't make it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.700 
not really a negative it doesn't make it
look<00:03:06.510> nice<00:03:06.720> even<00:03:07.140> though<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.290> does<00:03:07.410> get<00:03:07.590> kind

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
look nice even though it does get kind

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.470 
look nice even though it does get kind
of<00:03:07.800> dusty<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.280> you're<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.550> dusty<00:03:08.940> environments

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
of dusty if you're in dusty environments

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.880 
of dusty if you're in dusty environments
but<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.230> only<00:03:10.350> negative<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.860> would

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
but this is the only negative I would

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.800 
but this is the only negative I would
have<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.370> wasn't<00:03:11.820> able<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.480> use<00:03:12.630> this

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
have I wasn't able to actually use this

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.020 
have I wasn't able to actually use this
USB<00:03:13.320> cable<00:03:13.710> now<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> know<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.610> does<00:03:14.760> come<00:03:15.000> with

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
USB cable now I know it does come with

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.780 
USB cable now I know it does come with
the<00:03:15.210> USB<00:03:15.480> cable<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.010> only<00:03:17.160> issue<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.520> had

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
the USB cable but the only issue I had

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.880 
the USB cable but the only issue I had
was<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.270> way<00:03:18.600> too<00:03:18.660> short<00:03:19.260> guys<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.740> mean

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
was that it's way too short guys I mean

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.280 
was that it's way too short guys I mean
this<00:03:19.980> thing<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.250> basically<00:03:20.610> only<00:03:20.940> three<00:03:21.450> maybe

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
this thing is basically only three maybe

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.930 
this thing is basically only three maybe
four<00:03:22.680> inches<00:03:22.830> long<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.550> not<00:03:23.610> very

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
four inches long and it's not very

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.730 
four inches long and it's not very
flexible<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.780> I'm<00:03:25.170> guessing<00:03:25.530> that's<00:03:25.620> because

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
flexible and I'm guessing that's because

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.610 
flexible and I'm guessing that's because
it's<00:03:25.980> brand<00:03:26.310> new<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:27.480> if<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.230> another

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it's brand new now if you have another

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.920 
it's brand new now if you have another
external<00:03:29.040> USB<00:03:29.310> cable<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.090> guess<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.810> would

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
external USB cable I guess that would

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.960 
external USB cable I guess that would
work<00:03:31.170> just<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.680> well<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:32.100> know<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.370> had<00:03:32.550> used<00:03:32.730> one

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
work just as well I know I had used one

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.699 
work just as well I know I had used one
that<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.180> had<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:33.660> about<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.080> six<00:03:34.320> footer<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
that I had that's about a six footer and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.440 
that I had that's about a six footer and
that<00:03:35.250> works<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.520> fine<00:03:35.820> for<00:03:35.880> me<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.330> if<00:03:36.420> you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
that works just fine for me so if you

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.060 
that works just fine for me so if you
have<00:03:36.570> an<00:03:36.660> external<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.260> would<00:03:37.590> definitely<00:03:37.950> say

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
have an external I would definitely say

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.980 
have an external I would definitely say
probably<00:03:38.340> use<00:03:38.490> that<00:03:38.520> one<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:39.270> this<00:03:39.570> one<00:03:39.810> I

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
probably use that one because this one I

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.780 
probably use that one because this one I
mean<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.440> guys<00:03:40.709> saw<00:03:40.920> my<00:03:41.070> desk<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.400> my<00:03:41.430> first

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
mean you guys saw my desk in my first

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.610 
mean you guys saw my desk in my first
video<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.660> way<00:03:42.900> too<00:03:42.959> short<00:03:43.410> if

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
video and it is just way too short if

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.949 
video and it is just way too short if
you<00:03:43.740> do<00:03:44.130> not<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.670> much<00:03:44.850> space<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.750> deal

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
you do not have that much space to deal

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.390 
you do not have that much space to deal
with<00:03:46.170> with<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.920> has<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.220> really

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
with with this and it has to be really

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.590 
with with this and it has to be really
flexible<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.940> able<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.180> turn<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.540> around

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
flexible and able to turn it around

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.690 
flexible and able to turn it around
everything<00:03:49.530> like<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.920> but<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.190> does<00:03:50.340> really

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
everything like that but it does really

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.000
