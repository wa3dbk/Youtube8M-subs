approach

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
approach

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and let him face the other way so just

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.310 
and let him face the other way so just
to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> sense<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> tie<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> situation<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.360

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
so sometimes touching them you know the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.890 
so sometimes touching them you know the
way<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.520> was<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:40.940> will<00:01:41.330> not<00:01:41.480> change<00:01:41.510> the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
way I was that will not change the

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.060 
way I was that will not change the
behavior<00:01:42.260> so<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.410> gotta<00:01:42.590> come<00:01:42.800> out<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.040> a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
behavior so you gotta come out with a

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.960 
behavior so you gotta come out with a
different<00:01:43.220> approach

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970
