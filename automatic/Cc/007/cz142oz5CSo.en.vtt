now we've been hearing this from hcc for
years<00:01:44.850> let's<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.720> hope<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:45.990> figure<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.380> out

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
years let's just hope they figure it out

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
years let's just hope they figure it out
a<00:01:46.860> company<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> desperate<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.479> bring<00:01:48.720> us

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
a company that is desperate to bring us

we<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> 12<00:01:58.170> megapixel<00:01:58.290> shooter<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:59.040> the

we have a 12 megapixel shooter at the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.859 
we have a 12 megapixel shooter at the
back<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.670> apparently<00:01:59.939> capable<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.600> not

back that is apparently capable of not

back that is apparently capable of not
only<00:02:00.899> 4k<00:02:01.409> video<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.549> slow<00:02:02.850> motion<00:02:02.880> video<00:02:03.540> in

only 4k video but slow motion video in
4k<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> 240<00:02:05.729> frames<00:02:05.880> per<00:02:06.210> second<00:02:06.570> which

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
4k up to 240 frames per second which

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
4k up to 240 frames per second which
should<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.259> really<00:02:07.649> cool<00:02:07.890> even<00:02:08.580> more

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
should be really cool even more

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.949 
should be really cool even more
interesting<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.209> apparently<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.840> are

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
interesting is that apparently we are

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
interesting is that apparently we are
getting<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.289> 5<00:02:10.470> megapixel<00:02:10.649> shooter<00:02:11.099> /

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
getting a 5 megapixel shooter /

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
getting a 5 megapixel shooter /
front-facing<00:02:12.150> camera<00:02:12.690> which<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.349> something

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
front-facing camera which is something

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
front-facing camera which is something
important<00:02:14.459> considering<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.030> 1.2<00:02:15.660> megapixel

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
important considering the 1.2 megapixel

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.990 
important considering the 1.2 megapixel
camera<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.800> now<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.640> phone<00:02:17.819> should

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
camera we have now the phone should

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.150 
camera we have now the phone should
already<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.690> manufacturing<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.650> at<00:02:19.890> least

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
already be in manufacturing or at least

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.820 
already be in manufacturing or at least
very<00:02:20.280> close<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:21.420> let's<00:02:21.870> see<00:02:22.019> if<00:02:22.080> it's<00:02:22.230> true<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
very close so let's see if it's true and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.430 
very close so let's see if it's true and
finally<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> very<00:02:23.760> interesting<00:02:24.569> news<00:02:24.959> of

finally for the very interesting news of
the<00:02:25.680> day<00:02:25.920> we've<00:02:26.220> got<00:02:26.550> some<00:02:26.879> leaks<00:02:27.150> from<00:02:27.330> case

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
case and I am already getting stuck with

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.990 
case and I am already getting stuck with
these<00:02:40.170> names<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.160> seems<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.700> these<00:02:41.819> are

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
these names but it seems that these are

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.809 
these names but it seems that these are
the<00:02:42.030> two<00:02:42.330> products<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.989> are<00:02:43.110> coming<00:02:43.590> and

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
the two products that are coming and

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.759 
the two products that are coming and
judging<00:02:44.819> by<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.349> similarities<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
judging by the similarities of the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.930 
judging by the similarities of the
galaxy<00:02:47.370> note5<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> galaxy<00:02:49.230> s6<00:02:50.160> edge+

sorry<00:02:51.599> about<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.440> seems<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:53.069> there

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
sorry about that it seems that there

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.729 
sorry about that it seems that there
will<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.299> change<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.870> design<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.440> seems<00:02:55.620> that

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
will be a change in design it seems that

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.759 
will be a change in design it seems that
it'll<00:02:55.950> look<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.250> lot<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.269> galaxy<00:02:57.870> s6<00:02:58.319> in<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
it'll look a lot like the galaxy s6 in a

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.830 
it'll look a lot like the galaxy s6 in a
way<00:02:58.950> which<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.700> interesting<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.630> does

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
way which is interesting but it does

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.319 
way which is interesting but it does
lead<00:03:01.019> me<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.440> question<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.829> day<00:03:02.329> would

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
lead me to the question of the day would

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.479 
lead me to the question of the day would
you<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> galaxy<00:03:04.440> note5<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.250> came

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
you like a galaxy note5 of it came

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.979 
you like a galaxy note5 of it came
without<00:03:05.670> expandable<00:03:06.480> storage<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:06.959> a

replaceable<00:03:07.319> battery<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:08.099> we<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
replaceable battery as we see on the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.000 
replaceable battery as we see on the
leaks<00:03:08.940> as<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.360> probability<00:03:09.870> given<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.680> designs

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
leaks as a probability given the designs

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.100 
leaks as a probability given the designs
of<00:03:11.160> molarity<00:03:11.459> because<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.329> my<00:03:12.450> case<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.959> would

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
of molarity because in my case it would

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.199 
of molarity because in my case it would
totally<00:03:13.260> kill<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.920> note<00:03:14.099> lineup<00:03:14.549> for<00:03:14.790> me<00:03:14.970> I

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
totally kill the note lineup for me I

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.199 
totally kill the note lineup for me I
feel<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.110> s6<00:03:16.799> edge+<00:03:17.489> should<00:03:17.819> be<00:03:18.000> that

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
feel that the s6 edge+ should be that

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.699 
feel that the s6 edge+ should be that
phone<00:03:18.480> for<00:03:18.510> those<00:03:18.840> people<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.139> want<00:03:19.440> that
