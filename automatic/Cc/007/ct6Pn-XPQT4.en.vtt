they work but some people may not know

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.520 
they work but some people may not know
so<00:01:08.010> should<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.640> iPad<00:01:09.030> lock<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:10.229> will

never happens to other it happens to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
never happens to other it happens to
more<00:01:15.630> often<00:01:15.810> than<00:01:16.080> others<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:17.310> causes

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
more often than others so what causes

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
here we have this little switch this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
here we have this little switch this
switch<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:49.500> above<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> volume<00:01:50.340> rocker<00:01:50.549> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
switch is above the volume rocker this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
switch is above the volume rocker this
turns<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> volume<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.590> switch

turns the volume up and down this switch

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
turns the volume up and down this switch
can<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:53.880> things<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.810> flip<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> up

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
can do one of two things if I flip it up

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.830 
can do one of two things if I flip it up
we<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.070> volume<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.700> pull<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.909> down<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.659> goes

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
we have volume if I pull it down it goes

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
we have volume if I pull it down it goes
off<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.710> default<00:01:59.040> setting<00:01:59.189> now<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> may

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
off that's the default setting now I may

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.149 
off that's the default setting now I may
not<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> want<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> to
