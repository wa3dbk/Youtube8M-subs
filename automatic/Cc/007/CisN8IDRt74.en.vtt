00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.070
 the asx the subcompact of mitsubishi is 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 another of the vehicles immersed in a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.000
 increasingly growing segment born 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.730
 to compete with the qashqai nissan 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.520
 undisputed leader comes to look for his 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 hollow equipment performance and the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.330
 access version to the range is at 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.330
 sale from 20 thousand 720 euros 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.330
 the trait that dominates its design is without 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.160
 doubt the great calender that gives the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.290
 once a powerful and sporty aspect 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.720
 accentuated by a compact and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.730
 pretty cropped suspensions 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.220
 comfortable this little crossover with 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.290
 four doors and urban vocation raises 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.360
 a driving very similar to that of a 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.460
 conventional vehicle that also has 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.710
 pretty reduced the getaways out 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.450
 of the asphalt due in part to its scarce 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.890
 ground clearance encrypted so 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.890
 only 17 centimeters 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.950
 the interior although somewhat sober gives 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.750
 quality feeling and it's what 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.940
 Large enough to accommodate 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.710
 four occupants with comfort though 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.870
 the pecan seats of little support 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.150
 lateral the upholstery and trim 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.740
 of the doors are the same fabric and 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.750
 although the plastics are missed 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 soft all the pieces fit 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.650
 perfectly the indicators of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.540
 temperature and fuel go from 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 analogue to digital world since 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.990
 appear on a small color screen 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.530
 located between the tachometer and the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.530
 speedometer 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.810
 It comes with three levels of 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.460
 silence motion equipment and kite x the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.979
 two superiors include standard rims 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 17-inch alloy helps the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.060
 rear parking headlights bi xenon with 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.140
 adaptive lighting and connection 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.140
 bluetooth for mobile phones 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.960
 the mechanics available are 32 diesel 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.330
 and a gasoline that only transmits the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.670
 power to the front train this last 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.070
 is a 1.5 that delivers 116 horses 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.229
 identical figure to the propeller more 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.560
 simple diesel the most powerful engine 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.500
 in the hundreds of id is a 1.8 that eroga 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.420
 150 horses with a torque of 300 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.700
 Newton meters and can mount traction 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.830
 front or integral your performance is 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.630
 outstanding at low revolutions is 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.209
 very silent and the response to 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.040
 accelerator is blunt the box 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.670
 manual changes is very accurate and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.670
 short trips 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.409
 mitsubishi groups a series of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.480
 mechanisms to reduce the 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.760
 Consumption under the common name of clear 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.379
 tech all versions incorporate a 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.120
 automatic start and stop system 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.730
 for detentions called auto 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.980
 stop and go is detachable very soft and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.720
 quick response plus shoes 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.790
 tires with low resistance to 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.799
 rolling employs low engine oil 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.150
 viscosity and incorporates an indicator of 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.170
 change gears in the box 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.629
 instruments 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.890
 the address is electrical uses diodes 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.930
 bright for the pilots and 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.579
 intermittent and the alternator subtracts 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.510
 energy to the motor in the braking phases 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.510
 or deceleration 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.209
 the all-wheel drive system connectable 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.969
 It has three 2wd positions for 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.129
 circulation with 4wd front wheel drive 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.499
 which is haldex type and shares the pair in 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.719
 function adherence to the ground and 4wd 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:25.939
 which allows the rear train 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.769
 receive one with five times more torque than 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.209
 in the previous position improving the 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.209
 off-road attitudes of the vehicle 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.000
 of hard lines and with a certain look 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.730
 retro granted by its huge grid 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.190
 frontal to the reactor of the 50s the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.130
 mitsubishi asx is a solid option and 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.930
 clear if you're not too much that 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.790
 yes our recommendation is that what 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.050
 buy with integral traction because 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.630
 you can always find 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.630
 surprises in areas where it never snows
