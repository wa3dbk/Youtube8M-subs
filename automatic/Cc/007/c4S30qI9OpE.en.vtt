00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.889 

in<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:02.310> lesson<00:00:02.580> we'll<00:00:02.879> explore<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.510> joint

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
in this lesson we'll explore the joint

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.870 
in this lesson we'll explore the joint
tool<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:05.810> my<00:00:06.859> 2012<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.010> joint<00:00:08.280> tool<00:00:08.490> has

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
tool in my 2012 the joint tool has

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.640 
tool in my 2012 the joint tool has
updated<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.019> let's<00:00:10.170> go<00:00:10.260> ahead<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.440> take<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
updated so let's go ahead and take a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.129 
updated so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:00:10.800> at<00:00:10.920> those<00:00:11.040> changes<00:00:12.110> under<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
look at those changes under the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.140 
look at those changes under the
animation<00:00:13.679> menu<00:00:13.830> we've<00:00:14.700> got<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> skeleton

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
animation menu we've got a skeleton

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.500 
animation menu we've got a skeleton
joint<00:00:15.750> tool<00:00:15.929> options<00:00:17.029> now<00:00:18.029> reset<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
joint tool options now reset the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.109 
joint tool options now reset the
settings<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> top<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.490> degrees<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
settings so at the top we see degrees of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.529 
settings so at the top we see degrees of
freedom<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:23.430> basically<00:00:23.760> controls<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.510> much

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
freedom this basically controls how much

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.099 
freedom this basically controls how much
rotation<00:00:24.960> we'll<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.949> from<00:00:26.130> each<00:00:26.340> joint<00:00:27.109> so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
rotation we'll get from each joint so

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
rotation we'll get from each joint so
for<00:00:28.320> instance<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.920> were<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.279> uncheck<00:00:29.789> let's

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
for instance if we were to uncheck let's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.720 
for instance if we were to uncheck let's
say<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> x-axis<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.890> axis<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
say the x-axis now that axis is going to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.459 
say the x-axis now that axis is going to
be<00:00:32.820> locked<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> clearly<00:00:33.780> show<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
be locked and to clearly show you this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
be locked and to clearly show you this
let's<00:00:35.190> head<00:00:35.340> over<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.610> let's<00:00:36.149> say<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> side

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
let's head over to let's say the side

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.610 
let's head over to let's say the side
view<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.110> try<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.250> joint<00:00:38.760> chain<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> on

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
view and try out a joint chain so on

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
view and try out a joint chain so on
each<00:00:40.739> joint<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.579> made<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.329> x-axis<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
each joint that was made the x-axis is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
each joint that was made the x-axis is
locked<00:00:43.320> down<00:00:46.789> going<00:00:47.789> back<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> our<00:00:48.239> joint<00:00:48.840> tool

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
locked down going back to our joint tool

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.000 
locked down going back to our joint tool
settings<00:00:50.360> underneath<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.690> set<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
settings underneath we can set the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.410 
settings underneath we can set the
orientation<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.760> each<00:00:53.940> joint

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
orientation of each joint

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
orientation of each joint
so<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.230> first<00:00:55.530> setting<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.940> orient

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so this first setting is going to orient

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
so this first setting is going to orient
each<00:00:57.449> joint<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> world<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.670> on

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
each joint to the world so with that on

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.520 
each joint to the world so with that on
again<00:01:01.140> creating<00:01:02.059> another<00:01:03.059> chain<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.409> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
again creating another chain you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.859 
again creating another chain you can
clearly<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> difference<00:01:05.549> between<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
clearly see the difference between the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
clearly see the difference between the
joint<00:01:07.439> orientation<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> new<00:01:08.490> chain<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
joint orientation on this new chain and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.219 
joint orientation on this new chain and
the<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.900> created<00:01:10.290> earlier<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:14.040> further

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
the one we created earlier to further

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
the one we created earlier to further
explain<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.950> has<00:01:17.070> happened<00:01:17.580> selecting<00:01:18.540> both

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
explain what has happened selecting both

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.890 
explain what has happened selecting both
routes<00:01:19.159> we<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.790> display<00:01:21.210> menu<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
routes we can go to the display menu and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
routes we can go to the display menu and
underneath<00:01:22.860> transform<00:01:23.460> display<00:01:23.820> turn<00:01:24.090> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
underneath transform display turn on

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.039 
underneath transform display turn on
their<00:01:24.840> local<00:01:25.110> rotation<00:01:25.439> axes<00:01:26.869> again<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
their local rotation axes again the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.590 
their local rotation axes again the
first<00:01:28.320> chain<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:29.280> X<00:01:29.640> pointed<00:01:30.090> down<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> bone

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
first chain has X pointed down the bone

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.679 
first chain has X pointed down the bone
whereas<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.380> new<00:01:31.950> chain<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.520> oriented<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
whereas this new chain is oriented to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.380 
whereas this new chain is oriented to
the<00:01:33.720> world<00:01:37.100> for<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.340> uncheck<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.060> I'll

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the world for to uncheck this and I'll

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929 
the world for to uncheck this and I'll
also<00:01:39.570> turn<00:01:39.900> back<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.100> x-axis<00:01:41.700> under

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
also turn back on the x-axis under

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.660 
also turn back on the x-axis under
degrees<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> freedom<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.710> set<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> specific

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
degrees of freedom we can set a specific

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990 
degrees of freedom we can set a specific
orientation<00:01:45.380> for<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.470> joints<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:47.850> now

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
orientation for our joints so right now

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.260 
orientation for our joints so right now
the<00:01:48.060> default<00:01:48.770> has<00:01:49.770> X<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> primary<00:01:50.670> axis

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the default has X as the primary axis

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
the default has X as the primary axis
meaning<00:01:51.600> X<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> point<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
meaning X is going to point down the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.139 
meaning X is going to point down the
chain<00:01:53.240> Y<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.869> point<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.149> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
chain Y is going to point up and of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.139 
chain Y is going to point up and of
course<00:01:57.439> Z<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.680> automatically<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> point

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
course Z is automatically going to point

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.600 
course Z is automatically going to point
out<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.899> weight<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.579> can

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
out or weight now if we like we can

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
out or weight now if we like we can
definitely<00:02:06.090> change<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.290> something

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
definitely change this but something

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.229 
definitely change this but something
important<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> keep<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> mind<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> your

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
important to keep in mind is that your

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.750 
important to keep in mind is that your
primary<00:02:09.720> axis<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.739> your<00:02:10.979> secondary<00:02:11.400> axis

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
primary axis and your secondary axis

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.699 
primary axis and your secondary axis
cannot<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> same

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
cannot be the same

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.899 
cannot be the same
so<00:02:14.159> notice<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:15.750> why<00:02:16.409> as<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:17.010> secondary<00:02:17.519> axis

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
so notice with why as a secondary axis

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.720 
so notice with why as a secondary axis
if<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.269> try<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> use<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.890> primary<00:02:20.189> axis

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
if we try to use that as a primary axis

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.920 
if we try to use that as a primary axis
that's<00:02:20.939> not<00:02:21.120> gonna<00:02:21.239> work<00:02:21.450> mine's<00:02:21.750> gonna

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930

our route view its local rotation axes
we<00:02:36.120> could<00:02:36.269> see<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.750> now<00:02:37.069> why<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.430> primary

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
we could see that now why is the primary

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.209 
we could see that now why is the primary
axis<00:02:39.269> Z<00:02:39.810> as<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.079> secondary<00:02:42.709> now<00:02:43.709> let's<00:02:43.920> say<00:02:44.099> if

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
axis Z as the secondary now let's say if

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.679 
axis Z as the secondary now let's say if
we<00:02:44.280> wanted<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:46.530> X<00:02:46.889> be<00:02:47.129> our<00:02:47.280> primary<00:02:47.579> y<00:02:48.389> be

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
we wanted to have X be our primary y be

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.759 
we wanted to have X be our primary y be
the<00:02:49.109> secondary<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:51.019> we<00:02:52.019> get<00:02:52.169> from<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.439> default

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
the secondary as we get from the default

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.740 
the secondary as we get from the default
settings<00:02:53.159> but<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.459> wanted<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> y<00:02:54.000> axis<00:02:54.480> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
settings but we wanted the y axis to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.619 
settings but we wanted the y axis to
flip<00:02:55.220> we<00:02:56.220> most<00:02:56.400> certainly<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.909> do<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.090> using

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
flip we most certainly can do that using

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.330 
flip we most certainly can do that using
the<00:02:57.989> secondary<00:02:58.469> axis<00:02:59.340> world<00:02:59.760> orientation<00:03:01.340> so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the secondary axis world orientation so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.709 
the secondary axis world orientation so
let's<00:03:02.489> go<00:03:02.669> to<00:03:03.469> the<00:03:04.700> positive<00:03:05.700> setting<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.510> set

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
let's go to the positive setting and set

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.759 
let's go to the positive setting and set
this<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> negative<00:03:07.590> instead<00:03:09.439> so<00:03:10.439> now<00:03:10.560> as<00:03:10.739> we

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
this to negative instead so now as we

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.690 
this to negative instead so now as we
create<00:03:11.250> our<00:03:11.370> chain<00:03:13.189> looking<00:03:14.189> at<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> route

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
create our chain looking at the route

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.849 
create our chain looking at the route
you're<00:03:15.480> gonna<00:03:15.569> see<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.109> y<00:03:16.260> axis<00:03:16.680> has

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
you're gonna see that the y axis has

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:24.080 
you're gonna see that the y axis has
flipped<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.940> back<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.209> our<00:03:21.299> options<00:03:22.940> we<00:03:23.940> can

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
flipped going back to our options we can

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.390 
flipped going back to our options we can
also<00:03:24.239> set<00:03:24.720> our<00:03:24.930> scale<00:03:25.349> compensation<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.250> each

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
also set our scale compensation on each

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.179 
also set our scale compensation on each
joint<00:03:26.729> what<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.299> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.629> do<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.189> remove

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
joint what this is going to do is remove

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.979 
joint what this is going to do is remove
as<00:03:29.400> much<00:03:29.609> schooling<00:03:30.030> as<00:03:30.150> possible<00:03:30.629> as<00:03:30.780> we

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
as much schooling as possible as we

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.490 
as much schooling as possible as we
scale<00:03:31.319> our<00:03:31.379> joints<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.669> we'd<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.479> as<00:03:33.720> we

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
scale our joints so we'd see this as we

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.890 
scale our joints so we'd see this as we
deform<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:35.040> mesh<00:03:36.349> what<00:03:37.349> skill<00:03:37.620> competition<00:03:38.250> on

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
deform a mesh what skill competition on

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
deform a mesh what skill competition on
the<00:03:39.900> joint<00:03:40.680> underneath<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.340> joint<00:03:41.579> being

let's say scale the second joint the

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.569 
let's say scale the second joint the
third<00:03:49.650> joint<00:03:49.919> is<00:03:50.159> not<00:03:50.370> going<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:51.090> scale<00:03:51.479> at<00:03:51.720> all

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
third joint is not going to scale at all

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
created the joint chain so to show you

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.530 
created the joint chain so to show you

this if we were to select the second

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.229 
this if we were to select the second

I almost imagine the root bone creating

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.590 
I almost imagine the root bone creating
an<00:04:27.740> invisible<00:04:28.730> line<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:30.740> our<00:04:31.450> second<00:04:32.450> bone

an invisible line that our second bone
cannot<00:04:33.020> pass<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.800> that's<00:04:36.920> what<00:04:37.130> Auto<00:04:37.340> joint

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790

is<00:05:12.350> going<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:13.360> regulate<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.600> display<00:05:15.230> of<00:05:15.560> our

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
is going to regulate the display of our

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.780 
is going to regulate the display of our
joints<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:18.590> how<00:05:18.680> this<00:05:18.860> works<00:05:18.920> is<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:19.490> if<00:05:19.670> we

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
joints so how this works is that if we

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.250 
joints so how this works is that if we
were<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.150> create<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:21.280> bone<00:05:22.420> with<00:05:23.420> a<00:05:23.450> length<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:23.990> 1

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
were to create a bone with a length of 1

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.630 
were to create a bone with a length of 1
or<00:05:24.500> lower<00:05:26.080> our<00:05:27.080> radius<00:05:27.980> is<00:05:28.280> going<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.120> be<00:05:29.390> 0.5

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
or lower our radius is going to be 0.5

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.420 
or lower our radius is going to be 0.5
but<00:05:31.640> as<00:05:31.790> we<00:05:32.000> increase<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.630> value<00:05:33.250> for<00:05:34.250> to

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
but as we increase this value for to

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.500 
but as we increase this value for to
create<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.960> bone<00:05:36.250> longer<00:05:37.250> or<00:05:37.490> two<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.120> value<00:05:38.240> of

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
create a bone longer or two the value of

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.280 
create a bone longer or two the value of
30<00:05:39.040> then<00:05:40.040> our<00:05:40.250> bone<00:05:40.520> radius<00:05:41.030> is<00:05:41.270> going<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.170> be

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
30 then our bone radius is going to be

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.800 
30 then our bone radius is going to be
set<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.650> 2<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:45.380> show<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.620> this<00:05:46.540> for<00:05:47.540> to<00:05:47.630> create

this when we get to a value of 30 or

greater the radius of that root joint

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.350 
greater the radius of that root joint
it's<00:06:01.850> not<00:06:02.000> going<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.180> go<00:06:02.300> past<00:06:02.570> a<00:06:02.720> value<00:06:02.990> of<00:06:03.080> 2

it's not going to go past a value of 2

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.480 
it's not going to go past a value of 2
whereas<00:06:05.360> if<00:06:05.510> we<00:06:05.540> were<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.900> create<00:06:06.050> a<00:06:06.500> smaller

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
whereas if we were to create a smaller

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.320

joint<00:06:08.680> notice<00:06:09.680> as<00:06:11.350> we<00:06:12.350> go<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:13.130> value<00:06:13.640> of<00:06:13.670> 1<00:06:14.150> or
