my dog this woman I saw this side of had
a<00:00:20.220> couple<00:00:20.609> chunks<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.810> cords<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.189> that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
a couple chunks of cords I was like that

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
a couple chunks of cords I was like that
would<00:00:23.820> go<00:00:23.910> perfect<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.660> got<00:00:24.779> five<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.529> he

anyway I want to show you how to prepare
a<00:00:42.500> rocks<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.610> could<00:00:44.820> even<00:00:45.149> translate

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
a rocks and you could even translate

anything you're adding to aquarium so

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.490 
anything you're adding to aquarium so
you<00:00:55.500> find<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> backyard<00:00:56.280> anywhere<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
you find out in the backyard anywhere is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.150 
you find out in the backyard anywhere is
boil<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.430> will<00:00:59.609> take<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.090> anything

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
boil it this will take out anything

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.140 
boil it this will take out anything
living<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.049> could<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.229> harmful<00:01:05.150> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
living on it this could be harmful to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.190 
living on it this could be harmful to
your<00:01:06.710> your<00:01:07.729> inhabitants<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.020> it'll<00:01:10.020> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
your your inhabitants and it'll just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.590 
your your inhabitants and it'll just
clean<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.530> purify<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.250> sterilize<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.450> all

clean it purify it sterilize it do all
that<00:01:12.720> good<00:01:12.930> stuff<00:01:16.549> also<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> thing<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.030> think

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that good stuff also a thing they think

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.580 
that good stuff also a thing they think
about<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.810> pH<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.640> will<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.320> or<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
about is pH what it will do or how it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490 
about is pH what it will do or how it
will<00:01:22.710> affect<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> pH<00:01:23.600> good<00:01:24.600> test<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.049> rocks

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
will affect the pH good test for rocks

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
will affect the pH good test for rocks
is<00:01:26.040> taking<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.560> an<00:01:28.560> acid<00:01:29.040> like

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
is taking a little bit of an acid like

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.870 
is taking a little bit of an acid like
vinegar<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:33.200> any<00:01:34.200> acid<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.310> lemon<00:01:35.670> juice

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
vinegar or any acid really lemon juice

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.679 
vinegar or any acid really lemon juice
that's<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.840> acid<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.820> put<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.210> bit

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that's an acid you just put a little bit

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.649 
that's an acid you just put a little bit
on<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> starts<00:01:41.280> bubbling<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
on it and if it starts bubbling then you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.499 
on it and if it starts bubbling then you
know<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> rock<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.700> basic<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
know it that the rock is basic and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.770 
know it that the rock is basic and
there's<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.020> acid-base<00:01:46.470> reaction<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
there's an acid-base reaction going on

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.160 
there's an acid-base reaction going on
making<00:01:48.780> air<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.229> putting<00:01:49.890> off<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> gas<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
making air not putting off a gas and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.730 
making air not putting off a gas and
leaking<00:01:52.170> water<00:01:53.329> anyway<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:55.140> happening

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
leaking water anyway if that's happening

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.270 
leaking water anyway if that's happening
then<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.600> rock<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.229> basic<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
then you know that the rock is basic and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
then you know that the rock is basic and
will<00:01:59.610> raise<00:02:00.420> pH<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.090> depending<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
will raise pH so like depending on you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.819 
will raise pH so like depending on you

so<00:02:13.459> we<00:02:13.549> can<00:02:13.609> happen<00:02:13.999> but<00:02:14.209> anyway<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.920> would

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
so we can happen but anyway that would

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.319 
so we can happen but anyway that would
end<00:02:16.489> up<00:02:16.609> raising<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.420> pH<00:02:18.549> to<00:02:19.549> continue<00:02:19.999> with

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
end up raising the pH to continue with

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.500 
end up raising the pH to continue with
