00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone, Andrey Andreyev 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.529
 Andreevich my site all-all dot ru 1500 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.929
 first task 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.370
 figure skater 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 skating got marks 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.039
 many references there you will find the average rating 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.109
 this member to calculate the average 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.400
 the participant's score needs to be added first 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:34.770
 all scores in one greater amount of 5, 3 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:45.480
 plus 4, 8 plus 5, 4 plus 5, 0 plus 5 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:47.550
 , 3 + 5, 4 plus 5, 3 + 5, 2 plus 5, 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.719
 1 received a lot of goatsina 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.129
 times two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 ratings in 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.879
 textbook two two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.120
 I rewrote all nine and so 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.710
 to find the arithmetic average we 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.700
 we put all the estimates in one big 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 amount 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.640
 and then divide by the number of terms 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 and the terms of us 9 she received 9 ratings 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.400
 one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.070
 so divide by 9 so we need 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.229
 to fold 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:39.630
 how to fold let's fold 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:47.610
 then 5, 3 plus 4, 8 plus 5, 4 plus 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 5, 0 plus 5, 3 + 5, 4 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.540
 so let's get as much as we can 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.049
 here we count these because we 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.799
 just in my camera does not fit anymore 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.950
 times two three 4 5 6 1 6 fold at once 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.810
 two three 4 5 6 1 6 then three more are needed 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.150
 will add 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 so add 3 to 36 and even 410 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:24.980
 18 18 to 420 22 we write two in mind oh there 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.590
 two in mind 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:35.720
 what is generally two in mind was there 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.720
 2 to 5 7 7 to 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:46.920
 411 and five more and another 531 is obtained 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.890
 so we only put the first 6 and us 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 you still need to add these three 5, 3 5 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:03:01.769
 , 25, 15, 35, 25, 1 that is, and here 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.260
 still here these three add to this to 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.629
 that to the first 6 we add three more 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.690
 up to 25 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:19.650
 yes even 38 8 we write, 5 to 5 10 and here 6 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.100
 6 we write 1 in mind 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.100
 3 to 1 you dream turns 46.8 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:40.799
 brackets this whole amount is obtained in 46.8 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:49.709
 and need to divide by 9 if the draft 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:56.160
 myself in the moat forty forty six eight 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:59.459
 we divide by 9 we take 55 by 945 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.760
 18 we demolish 8 we demolish already after comma 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:11.419
 it's time to put a comma and take 22 at 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:11.419
 918 average rating 5.2 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:21.000
 5.2 is the answer is the average score that 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.560
 got involved in some kind of there 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.360
 figure skating competition 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.340
 advise my videos to friends write to 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.570
 comments on how much was clear 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.570
 bye everyone
