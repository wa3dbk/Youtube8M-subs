00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.519
 this city did not seem to me immediately familiar 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.700
 and close but after six years I 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.270
 I understand that I really loved his powerful 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.790
 energy of very active energetic people 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.289
 my friends who appeared here and 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.089
 revealed to me the meaning of this city 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.849
 in a banal phrase I would say that 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.619
 beauty in the eye of the beholder when I go 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.920
 past the Novodevichy Convent it seems to me 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.350
 no more amazing view i think 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.790
 everyone can find for themselves in Moscow and 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.790
 those moments that will inspire 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 support both the artist and the businessman 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 anyone 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.870
 when we painted potter and for the absolute 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.260
 muscle we went over a huge amount 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.110
 Russian artists in the fields and the same or 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.240
 Khokhloma actually 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.160
 tape came one of the first in the head 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.620
 because he always painted such a mask 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.520
 a little drunk so very lively 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:24.540
 once abyss what fun here in an hour 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.610
 today in today's Moscow 2013 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.610
 the bottle turned out just like that 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.340
 I would like to think that in my 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.210
 creativity is important this beauty and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.050
 creation 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 I strive for this need 1 very clearly 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.250
 understand the task which costs the second 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.360
 good to know the base material from 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.470
 which is inspired and third then 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 here is all this forget and task and the entire collection 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
 material and draw here what's what 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.860
 comes from the heart and from the heart then 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.860
 get real
