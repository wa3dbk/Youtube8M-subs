00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
shoreline products and put a riser down

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.300 
shoreline products and put a riser down
here<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.180> now<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.360> have<00:04:25.540> a<00:04:25.600> stop<00:04:25.960> on<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.770> up<00:04:27.010> and

tail<00:04:41.949> stock<00:04:42.600> for<00:04:43.600> my<00:04:43.750> stop<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.410> sometimes<00:04:45.039> you

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
tail stock for my stop and sometimes you

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.000 
tail stock for my stop and sometimes you
can't<00:04:45.940> use<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> tail<00:04:46.539> stock<00:04:46.870> for<00:04:47.139> your<00:04:47.229> stop<00:04:47.530> you

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
can't use a tail stock for your stop you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.279 
can't use a tail stock for your stop you
have<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.430> look<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:49.030> when<00:04:49.360> you<00:04:49.479> see<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.050> line

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
have to look and when you see the line

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.490 
have to look and when you see the line
touch<00:04:51.100> that<00:04:51.400> line<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:52.240> can<00:04:52.449> stop<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.350> can

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
touch that line you can stop you can

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.400 
touch that line you can stop you can
actually<00:04:53.800> feel<00:04:54.430> your<00:04:54.760> cutter<00:04:55.389> going<00:04:55.930> into<00:04:56.260> the

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
actually feel your cutter going into the

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.279 
actually feel your cutter going into the
previous<00:04:56.949> design<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:58.030> does<00:04:58.389> though<00:04:58.660> take<00:04:58.960> some

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
previous design it does though take some

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.400 
previous design it does though take some
time<00:04:59.590> to<00:05:00.100> get<00:05:00.250> used<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.699> that<00:05:01.510> type<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:02.080> skill

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
time to get used to that type of skill

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.040 
time to get used to that type of skill
it's<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:03.039> feel<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.729> can<00:05:03.910> get<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.870> once

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
it's a feel that you can get and once

it's a feel that you can get and once
you<00:05:05.199> get<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:06.060> you'll<00:05:07.060> always<00:05:07.270> have<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.810> it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
you get it you'll always have it it

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.730 
you get it you'll always have it it
takes<00:05:08.229> it's<00:05:08.740> effortless<00:05:09.039> to<00:05:09.669> push<00:05:10.740> that

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
takes it's effortless to push that

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.060 
takes it's effortless to push that
cutter<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.550> make<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.150> small<00:05:13.539> chip<00:05:14.070> now

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
cutter and make that small chip now

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.730 
cutter and make that small chip now
using<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.090> diamond<00:05:16.330> there's<00:05:16.990> even<00:05:17.260> less<00:05:17.440> effort

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
using a diamond there's even less effort

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.670 
using a diamond there's even less effort
but<00:05:18.610> it's<00:05:18.729> a<00:05:18.789> different<00:05:19.180> look<00:05:19.419> not<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:19.990> bad<00:05:20.320> look

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
but it's a different look not a bad look

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.339 
but it's a different look not a bad look
not<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.400> better<00:05:21.700> look<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.780> different<00:05:23.169> look

some of these projects down here we're

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.540 
some of these projects down here we're
done<00:05:25.690> with<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.930> diamond<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:27.039> few<00:05:27.250> of<00:05:27.430> them

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
done with a diamond and a few of them

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.330 
done with a diamond and a few of them
were<00:05:27.700> done<00:05:27.910> with<00:05:28.510> this<00:05:28.720> Gish<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.740> cutter

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
were done with this Gish a cutter

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.659 
were done with this Gish a cutter
now<00:05:30.700> Ghia<00:05:31.000> Shea<00:05:31.300> cutter<00:05:31.660> is<00:05:31.930> really<00:05:32.830> just<00:05:33.550> a

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
now Ghia Shea cutter is really just a

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.180 
now Ghia Shea cutter is really just a
quarter<00:05:34.120> inch<00:05:34.300> tool<00:05:34.660> but<00:05:34.930> like<00:05:35.440> I<00:05:35.620> have<00:05:35.889> right

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.390 
this piece about every 10 degrees till I
got<00:06:43.510> over<00:06:43.720> to<00:06:43.750> the<00:06:43.900> side<00:06:44.230> went<00:06:44.890> back<00:06:45.100> to<00:06:45.280> the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
got over to the side went back to the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.000 
got over to the side went back to the
center<00:06:45.790> then<00:06:46.450> it<00:06:46.600> did<00:06:47.080> it<00:06:47.200> to<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.440> opposite

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
center then it did it to the opposite

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.390 
center then it did it to the opposite
side<00:06:48.310> so<00:06:49.000> you<00:06:49.360> can<00:06:49.540> modify<00:06:49.930> it<00:06:50.140> by<00:06:50.410> going<00:06:50.620> 10

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
side so you can modify it by going 10

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.940 
side so you can modify it by going 10
degrees<00:06:51.760> in<00:06:51.790> the<00:06:52.090> middle<00:06:52.420> 20<00:06:53.410> on<00:06:53.530> the<00:06:53.680> sides

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
degrees in the middle 20 on the sides

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.420 
degrees in the middle 20 on the sides
you<00:06:54.340> can<00:06:54.850> do<00:06:55.030> with<00:06:55.210> it<00:06:55.360> and<00:06:55.510> play<00:06:55.750> with<00:06:55.780> it<00:06:55.990> is

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
you can do with it and play with it is

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.130 
you can do with it and play with it is
as<00:06:57.430> much<00:06:57.730> as<00:06:57.790> you<00:06:58.090> want<00:06:58.300> and<00:06:58.480> it's<00:06:58.600> all<00:06:58.780> easy

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
as much as you want and it's all easy

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
because it's all done right here with

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.120 
because it's all done right here with
the<00:07:02.320> d-10

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
the d-10

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.970 
the d-10
now<00:07:03.910> you<00:07:03.970> can<00:07:04.210> do<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.390> in<00:07:04.600> different<00:07:04.780> ways<00:07:05.200> but

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:05.980 
now you can do it in different ways but

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.190 
now you can do it in different ways but
the<00:07:06.130> detent<00:07:06.580> works<00:07:06.820> really<00:07:07.060> well<00:07:07.330> on<00:07:07.630> this

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
the detent works really well on this

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.620 
the detent works really well on this
straight<00:07:08.560> line<00:07:08.760> modification<00:07:09.760> from<00:07:10.270> window

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
straight line modification from window

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.420 
straight line modification from window
way<00:07:11.340> so<00:07:12.340> if<00:07:12.640> you<00:07:12.850> ever<00:07:13.000> have<00:07:13.180> a<00:07:13.240> chance<00:07:13.510> to<00:07:13.720> try
