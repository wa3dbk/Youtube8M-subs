I guess there's a there's a like a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
I guess there's a there's a like a
there's<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:52.280> mirror<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> sink<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's like a mirror with the sink and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
there's like a mirror with the sink and
then<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> bathroom<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:56.070> good

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
