just<00:01:22.409> talking<00:01:22.770> nonsense<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.909> not

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
just talking nonsense now it's not

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
just talking nonsense now it's not
terrible<00:01:24.630> though<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.350> bad<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.500> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
terrible though it's not as bad as I

thought it would be and I think maybe

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
thought it would be and I think maybe
