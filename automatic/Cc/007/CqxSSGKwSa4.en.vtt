00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:08.878
 In previous episodes ... 

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:11.130
 I got a call from the Blizzard guys. 

00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.625
 They offered to create motorcycles for World of Warcraft. 

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.505
 One for the Alliance, the other for the Horde. 

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:20.515
 The players themselves will then choose which one will appear in the game. 

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:25.545
 A motorcycle with more votes will be added to World of Warcraft. 

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:31.010
 We may have to send the cat under the tail of half a day's work. 

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:38.236
 The mechanics were eliminated by one person, and we decided to somehow cheer them up. 

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:41.708
 It turned out cool. The competitive spirit quickly awoke in us. 

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:43.995
 What a monkey is evil. 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.522
 Count up, I killed a raccoon. 

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:49.986
 Damn Pete to and fro for two minutes. 

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.777
 Well, yes, and you until the very end in the corner snapped. 

00:00:57.388 --> 00:00:59.512
 These things help relieve stress. 

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:02.072
 and create a more pleasant atmosphere. 

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:08.453
 The deadlines are very tight, and I thought maybe you would like ... 

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:10.353
 ... personally take a look at the choppers ... 

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:12.381
 Let's ride horses! 

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.899
 When customers come, we want them to receive a holistic perception. 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.612
 We are thinking about fixing the steering wheel. Maybe in the form of a sword ... 

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:20.934
 Otpad 

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:23.006
 In the best sense. 

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.918
 Very interesting to see how they use 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.418
 typical for the Horde elements. 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.594
 If this is only a part, then what will be in finished form? 

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:36.069
 We are already approaching the final. 

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.027
 Install the front fender on this chopper. 

00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:43.830
 Not. I will not do it. 

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.868
 This seems to be the last detail. It's time to start the engines! 

00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:54.282
 Oh yeah. 

00:01:57.923 --> 00:01:59.074
 We are satisfied! 

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:02.744
 The Alliance Chopper is sleek, elegant. 

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.017
 This is an elegant but formidable weapon. 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.563
 Bike Horde as a whole looks very aggressive. 

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:15.277
 It would be cool to sit on this chopper 

00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:17.177
 and set off to wreak havoc on Azeroth. 

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:20.306
 I am very proud of them. Real Azeri choppers. 

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.042
 This is a matter of honor. 

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:24.065
 It's time to finish this story.
