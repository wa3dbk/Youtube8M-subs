00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.099
 hi how are you I hope you are super 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.440
 well welcome to my channel I'm with 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 you like vid and tomÃ¡s and it's about 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.529
 some new policies that are going to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 highlight the brand 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.660
 colors and good I thought 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 very beautiful and are a very good 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.480
 price and good I want to try them all 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.310
 with six colors and here I have them all 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.539
 I'm going to show you one by one that I'm going to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.539
 start with this game 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.250
 As you could see, it's fine 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.730
 nice is like spring-summer total and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.730
 completely 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.970
 and it's the tone are finished without seeing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 completely being 31 mate the only 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.330
 that is a little less brightness is the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.150
 yellow they have below that of applicator and 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.870
 a mirror what is not also u2 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.290
 They are super pretty their palettes I bought them 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 in the stores to free plate has as 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.650
 12 months the store arrived but I 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.650
 just last Friday I went 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 or if they are super pigmented but 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 we want them less recharged already 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.790
 you know only a very little product already 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.630
 blur very well any kind of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.289
 shadow can be adapted to the greens 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.870
 is a medium is a green pistachio and a 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.920
 lime green 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.880
 clarito 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.880
 cake type 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.700
 they are precious to little no and good as 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.980
 they could see are five tones and the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.900
 Machito is here in the corner that the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.030
 second floor was super neutral 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.910
 beautiful and this talk is called music 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.580
 city â€‹â€‹is ideal for school work 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.660
 for impressive eyes in shades 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.750
 neutral 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.780
 one can mostly well-made 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 but when the tones are neutral that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 it's like you throw away using a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.470
 tone of light much stronger as 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.530
 you can see this that I bring is tiradito 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.260
 but it's very powerful so already as in 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.080
 strong tones is actually clarito 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.959
 with the exception that it is very strong 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.959
 all in our need to 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.959
 extract it 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.640
 and they are very nice even though this 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.590
 thorough is the illuminator 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.300
 but they are all very beautiful, very beautiful 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.820
 like a mole brown half purple 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.710
 and these are the typical brown 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.460
 hysteria is clear as for the 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.880
 eyelid mobile and the illuminator that exists 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.880
 from between 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.150
 I say goodbye with this beautiful is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.910
 definitely to do what is 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.760
 night is venice of this purple this 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.590
 They are duller but they are strong is 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.650
 to say is not so loud the purple one is 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.319
 like a donkey translations the difference 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.220
 and it is very precious that 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:16.390
 I'm going to put some switches of these 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.390
 at the first time 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.270
 that is to the first you 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.470
 I fancy myself to make some eyes 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.470
 awesome in purple a hand 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.470
 precious 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.960
 and they are also neutral media but 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.280
 good if you like to play with color 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.230
 but you do not dare to use all of our 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.250
 minds this palette I recommend it for 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.990
 that's because you're going to put 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.470
 but it's going to be noticed that it's purple and this one 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.420
 which is with a color like that of the whole 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.459
 pizzi and beige 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.739
 and that I do have another purple but I do not know 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.330
 it seems to those who bring others if they 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.220
 they come until you have all you can do 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.290
 the gradients that come different 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.659
 we are delayed and 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.760
 well it 's true in the middle I have a 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.430
 thing is the core is very nice for 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.530
 winter also brings a rice and three 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.829
 so they eat those all with these two 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:23.519
 the sun not so very different and with the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.519
 Garita it also called standard 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.290
 a few more months 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.590
 it's always better makeup last 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.410
 I teach you this traitor to 21 margin is 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.419
 a type of purple as well as a very neutral 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.800
 as eggplant and eggplant the 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.620
 go through techniques and it's called difficult 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.770
 may 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.560
 but I'll leave you the names in the 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.190
 description box up by palette and 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.699
 the numbering they have has a green 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.460
 oliver stevic precious and a bucket 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.639
 similar to the one that has this palette but 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.560
 a little clearer as you can see 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.180
 buy more little things of the month girls 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.760
 I'm going to make the video here I did not want 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.919
 mix other brands and so for that 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.130
 was a review specifically of 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.520
 I liked these palettes a lot too 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.460
 I want to show you my enamel 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.030
 I have used super simple but 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.639
 good eye-catching food with lips and are 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.160
 these two tones of kane lake that also 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.960
 I'm going to put the names in the little box 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.320
 description in case you liked it 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.510
 personal to me I kill this tone moradito 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.950
 line when the jehovah asks you 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.040
 and if we do not have purple precious gum 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.440
 the truth the enamels of china I do not know 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.970
 are of my favorites I think they are from 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.970
 the ones that I have most of this brand 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.630

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.400
