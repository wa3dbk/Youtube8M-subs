00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
some activated carbon down in there a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.950 
some activated carbon down in there a
little<00:01:11.010> mesh<00:01:11.130> filter<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.790> will<00:01:12.450> filter<00:01:12.780> out

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
little mesh filter I will filter out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that that'll take care of their ammonia

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.600 
that that'll take care of their ammonia
and<00:01:19.619> everything<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.960> got<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.610> air

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and everything in it got me a little air

and everything in it got me a little air
induction<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.200> sure<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
induction on the side I'm not sure that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.749 
induction on the side I'm not sure that
little<00:01:25.799> bubble<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> work<00:01:26.460> supposed

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
little bubble is going to work supposed

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
little bubble is going to work supposed
to<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> able<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.210> 10<00:01:27.420> gallons<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.960> we'll

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
to be able to do 10 gallons but we'll

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.910 
to be able to do 10 gallons but we'll
see<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> works<00:01:30.200> basically<00:01:31.200> water<00:01:31.619> pumps

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
see how it works basically water pumps

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.789 
see how it works basically water pumps
up<00:01:32.040> into<00:01:32.220> there<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.579> falls<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.060> down

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
up into there and then falls back down

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.010 
up into there and then falls back down
keeping<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> water<00:01:35.009> circulated<00:01:35.810> area<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
keeping the water circulated area it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.490 
keeping the water circulated area it
infiltrated<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.720> probably<00:01:39.720> got<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.049> 60

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
infiltrated I probably got about 60

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.120 
infiltrated I probably got about 60
bucks<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.130> whole<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.520> rig<00:01:43.009> I'm<00:01:44.009> not

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
bucks in this whole little rig I'm not

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
bucks in this whole little rig I'm not
sure<00:01:44.310> exactly<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:44.970> well<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> work

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
sure exactly how well it's going to work

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
sure exactly how well it's going to work
because<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.439> haven't<00:01:46.740> tested<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.310> yet<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.909> if
