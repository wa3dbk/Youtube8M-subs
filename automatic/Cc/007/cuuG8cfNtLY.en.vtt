00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.079
 they don't know what's going on in this castle 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.960
 for Putin people start killing each 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 friend's slowly starting 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.710
 staying blanket 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.050

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.290
 more about this excitement but with this 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.820
 library library are located 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.740
 about 100 gates 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
 and further with piracy by the way 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.050
 we have no choice 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.050
 we have to go 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.050
 wait 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.200
 attack raise your threshold 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 Ambassador to Baku 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.280
 why we stopped 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.130
 I wanted to ask 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.810
 the total is in the remaining rattan 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.430
 I looked now 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.370
 and 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 yes there 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.770
 building 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.370
 Is there something wrong 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.230
 it is open but it is on the wrong side 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.360
 they were all closed 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 almost three and we will do km 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240
 Mr. Piotr has the door locked 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 what should we do 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.279
 one can understand that the loss is dreaming 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.279
 damn right 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 I'm after you 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.069
 and 310 years old that's it 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.759
 so are we generally going to go to 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.339
 library 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.709
 here she is 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.469
 and as we descend 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.689
 Leading Anna 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.859
 exactly 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.409
 not that 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.409
 it was sent effective 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.799
 maybe it was dangerous 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.579
 it seems we will have to break the veto mountain 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.579
 mid in order to find at least something all the locks 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.909
 rummaged through all these books Kiev Prime 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.909
 start writing on the lock 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.049
 Pauline 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.989
 oh it snowed 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.510
 I thought we should read these books. 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.479
 houses 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.279
 sales korea 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.359
 sit wailing 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.359
 it will be pleased and cozy pashkin 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:50.849
 you must also think how to close 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.009
 this world 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.149
 will have to think 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.209
 Okay, and showed the fireplace 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.349
 the exact same remains 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349
 same as from our ship 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.249
 so now radar know better about it 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.249
 the castle 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.169
 for something that is unthinkable 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:20.449
