00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.120
 how are your inclusion I bring you a 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.160
 new improvement that has come out recently 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.860
 in the artificial intelligence of the 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.590
 clippers I already know that this is heard very 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.140
 fucking strange since I can scripps 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.830
 you know they are not very smart 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.090
 let's say but this aggregate is in a 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.880
 small improvement in your intelligence 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.520
 artificial and it's something very fucked because 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 if by itself the clippers were very 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.650
 castro sos now imagine if they are 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.509
 making smarter dsg but good 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.190
 Today I 'm going to show you what it is but I think 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.960
 that right now I'm going to change the world 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.149
 since I do not want to explode anything here in 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.610
 this world we are going to change the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.100
 world I think we're going to put here not 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.010
 I remember that the world is this good 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.050
 yes I think that here is good and also in 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.079
 this world this is in a few 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.090
 tests since I plan that months 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.250
 series of fights demos so good 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.079
 let's put in this video a small 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.650
 as a goal it's not going to be very big 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.990
 we are not going to put 90 likes 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.430
 and this one returns the series of fights demos 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.130
 right now stress in all four tests 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.590
 over there and also here because it 's a 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.970
 little hard I'm not trying to do 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.010
 that those who fight between 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.990
 them and I've been struggling enough 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.880
 but I'm going to give if we get to the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.680
 90 likes then I'll see how I do it 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.450
 install a mode that is special for that 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.160
 the good fight monsters go I 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.380
 to go see all that later but 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.090
 you know the goal 90 the jce not us 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.310
 not so much in many videos we arrived 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.680
 to 90 lies, so let's see what 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.270
 but but going back to the subject we are going to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 prove what the new intelligence is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.840
 artificial clippers is not here 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.969
 we have where are we going to take out a clip 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.609
 and well you know when exploit 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.820
 clippers then well exploding without 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.649
 more but now yes this we invoke you 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.469
 we put some clippers for example that 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.119
 we expose two clips not this one I put on 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.579
 game 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.119
 survival was going to notice that when one 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.119
 explode 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.289
 well it did not work there since you can 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.610
 know you have to exploit one and the other 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.970
 we are not going to put this one 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 oh god knows stupid to see hold 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.500
 hold on, have patience from our test 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.570
 aiko of your fucking mother 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 or that I already know that a few of these 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.430
 eggs to put also let's put 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.220
 here a brother clip until it happens goes to 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.290
 explode one 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.880
 and I do not know if they noticed what happened to them like that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.740
 that you think you see I put a crime to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.860
 close to your little friend come closer 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.040
 You see, I put one on, wants to explode and the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.719
 other 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.330
 as for the other time it's going to explode 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:42.420
 he runs like crazy 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.060
 those of me are very funny again 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.170
 we will not put me there is not a lot of hate 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.210
 die ok back again this we go 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.860
 to put another clipper because then I do not know 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.480
 has appreciated quite well we are not going to 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.950
 put yourself in a nicer place here is 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.060
 ok it 's fine let's put a clip 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.780
 but that follow me to follow me 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.780
 we are putting the other 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.910
 my god the clips are evolved 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.740
 but they are evolving and do not fuck with me 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.310
 let's make them come together a little more 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.310
 no no no no 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.110
 oh god what happens is that when two 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.630
 explode when they begin to charge at 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.340
 At the same time there, I do not know anymore 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.990
 does not run one does not have to do 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.820
 is that one starts charging and the other 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.880
 still not charged they dwelt to see if 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.720
 now it works sometimes is this field 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.819
 is the other leaves running and now the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.459
 early morning whore 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.290
 ay was not well in ficod then good 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.849
 this is a simple improvement no, either 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.129
 it means that they are going to be super 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.900
 smart and it was going to be like a turn 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.749
 brain that will chase you and not or 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.340
 no but it's a simple improvement to see 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:54.260
 I want to try something else in the end we're going to 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.049
 get back in creative I want to 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.939
 test if this also works with the 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.120
 normal not like these as for example 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.799
 a zombie we are not going to test if it works 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.930
 with a zombie that I did not decide works 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.400
 with others there is either dying for 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.799
 inai students 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.520
 let's try let's put how many 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.920
 clippers I put on survivor 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.440
 although it seems that with the other modes there 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.940
 this works 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.220
 it looks like that with the other mice 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.380
 it does not work so it seems that 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.000
 only the clippers are the ones that 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.070
 they're making smarter I thought 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.170
 that they were also likely to run 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.540
 the other modes but it seems that 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.920
 only the clippers these are the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.620
 that are starting to become more 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.170
 looks smart tell me what they think about 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.220
 this like this small improvement will 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.870
 I would like more 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.730
 smart the clippers or if you 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.580
 He would like to stay like that 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.440
 stupid as they are right now because no 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.360
 I know I like how they are since then 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.460
 imagine if they were smarter and 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.770
 they fuck you a lot more than they fuck you 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.270
 right now but hey this ends 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.270
 this here so I hope there will be 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.540
 liked and see you until next time 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.540
 wow
