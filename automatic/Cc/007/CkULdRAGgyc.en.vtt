those growth tips right there are loaded
with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> flower<00:00:39.750> buds<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.950> like

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
with the flower buds and they look like

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.010 
with the flower buds and they look like
that<00:00:44.210> they<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> little

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that they come out with a little

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
that they come out with a little
cone-shaped<00:00:46.860> thing<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:48.000> there

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
cone-shaped thing like that right there

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
cone-shaped thing like that right there
and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.860> they<00:00:49.860> turn<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and then they turn into that the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.880 
and then they turn into that the
sensitive<00:00:52.800> plant<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.210> cool

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
sensitive plant is really really cool

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
sensitive plant is really really cool
when<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> touch<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.690> closes<00:00:58.289> up

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
when you touch it like this it closes up

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.069 
when you touch it like this it closes up
and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> felt<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.300> goes<00:01:00.510> downward

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and then it felt it like goes downward

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.289 
and then it felt it like goes downward
so<00:01:02.010> another<00:01:02.250> example<00:01:03.500> like<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
so another example like that and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.929 
so another example like that and
sometimes<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.630> leaf<00:01:07.250> will<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.640> trigger

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
sometimes a leaf will actually trigger

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.260 
sometimes a leaf will actually trigger
another<00:01:09.479> leaf<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.990> move<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.470> well<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.060> only

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
another leaf to move as well so not only

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.679 
another leaf to move as well so not only
can<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.990> touch<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.939> like<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.479> touch

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
can you just touch one like if you touch

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.410 
can you just touch one like if you touch
it<00:01:15.960> it'll<00:01:16.920> slowly<00:01:17.430> trigger<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> don't

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it it'll slowly trigger them I don't

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
it it'll slowly trigger them I don't
know<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.689> saw<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.409> yes<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
know if you saw that but yes see I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.359 
know if you saw that but yes see I
touched<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.780> maybe<00:01:21.960> five<00:01:22.320> seconds<00:01:22.830> ago<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
touched it maybe five seconds ago and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
touched it maybe five seconds ago and
then<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.820> moved<00:01:24.090> down<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:25.020> five<00:01:25.259> seconds

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
then it moved down about five seconds

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.760 
then it moved down about five seconds
later<00:01:26.240> wow<00:01:27.240> those<00:01:27.540> leaves<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.140> closed<00:01:28.530> up

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
