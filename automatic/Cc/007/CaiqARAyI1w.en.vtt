00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
but it was one that fell and died so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.080 
but it was one that fell and died so
we're<00:02:22.980> planting<00:02:23.220> two<00:02:23.400> more<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.670> those<00:02:23.820> and

we're planting two more of those and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.750 
we're planting two more of those and
then<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> mr.<00:02:25.860> stripey<00:02:26.310> which<00:02:26.610> I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
then this is a mr. stripey which I

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.490 
then this is a mr. stripey which I
haven't<00:02:27.060> grown<00:02:27.150> before<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.350> is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
haven't grown before and then this is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.170 
haven't grown before and then this is
the<00:02:28.530> solar<00:02:28.920> fire<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.550> which<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.760> supposedly

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.490 
the solar fire one which is supposedly
really<00:02:30.480> good<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> heat<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.230> we'll<00:02:31.350> see

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
really good with the heat so we'll see

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.270 
really good with the heat so we'll see
we'll<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.040> what's<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.460> with<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.940> got<00:02:33.930> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
these are called cross country so I grew

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.860 
these are called cross country so I grew
those<00:03:25.650> from<00:03:25.890> seed<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.120> square<00:03:27.660> foot

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
those from seed and the square foot

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.229 
those from seed and the square foot
method<00:03:28.200> says<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.590> plant<00:03:28.800> 2<00:03:28.980> /<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.489> so

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
method says you can plant 2 / and so

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.120 
method says you can plant 2 / and so

100<00:03:46.470> i<00:03:46.530> think<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.800> suite<00:03:46.980> 100<00:03:47.430> am<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.720> my

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
100 i think the suite 100 am I in my

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.000 
100 i think the suite 100 am I in my
book<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> little<00:03:49.500> bit<00:03:49.620> better<00:03:49.709> than<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
book is a little bit better than the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.260 
book is a little bit better than the
cherry<00:03:50.220> tomato<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.730> little<00:03:51.060> bit<00:03:51.150> more

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
cherry tomato the little bit more

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.240 
cherry tomato the little bit more
sweetness<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> lot<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:52.800> just

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
sweetness and I like it a lot but just

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.150 
sweetness and I like it a lot but just
to<00:03:53.310> kind<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.580> give<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.850> some<00:03:54.030> contrast<00:03:55.160> thrown

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
to kind of give it some contrast thrown

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.090 
to kind of give it some contrast thrown
a<00:03:56.190> yellow<00:03:56.630> yellow<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.810> tomato<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.920> there<00:03:58.950> as

a yellow yellow a tomato in there as

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.790 
a yellow yellow a tomato in there as

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
well so so that's pretty much that's

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.770 
well so so that's pretty much that's
pretty<00:04:02.010> much<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.160> i<00:04:02.370> got<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> flower<00:04:03.360> on<00:04:03.540> these

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
hopefully they'll grow a little bit

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.290 
hopefully they'll grow a little bit
stronger<00:04:08.250> before<00:04:08.489> they<00:04:08.700> try<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:08.940> grow<00:04:09.120> any

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300

actually<00:05:31.050> when<00:05:31.170> i<00:05:31.200> posted<00:05:31.650> my<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:31.830> didn't

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
actually when i posted my I didn't

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.380 
actually when i posted my I didn't
planned<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.610> but<00:05:32.670> that<00:05:32.790> was<00:05:32.880> when<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.000> posted<00:05:33.300> my

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
planned it but that was when I posted my

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.900 
planned it but that was when I posted my
first<00:05:33.510> video<00:05:33.840> I<00:05:34.020> think<00:05:34.260> last<00:05:34.830> year<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.400> so

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
first video I think last year so so

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.970 
first video I think last year so so
we'll<00:05:36.030> see<00:05:36.180> how<00:05:36.210> this<00:05:36.360> year<00:05:36.810> compares<00:05:37.290> but<00:05:37.560> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
we'll see how this year compares but the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.830 
we'll see how this year compares but the
bed<00:05:38.130> stuff<00:05:38.460> definitely<00:05:39.330> grows<00:05:39.450> better<00:05:39.660> the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
bed stuff definitely grows better the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.450 
bed stuff definitely grows better the
upside<00:05:40.080> down<00:05:40.230> stuff<00:05:40.440> definitely<00:05:40.590> works<00:05:40.920> but

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
upside down stuff definitely works but

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.280 
upside down stuff definitely works but
