00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.429
 yes and there I get head shot first 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:13.019
 I really wanted to get this one first 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 shot try a kill thing and 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.750
 that is exactly what will happen now and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.960
 of course I take full weight then I am 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960
 an idiot 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 Of course I do not have any 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 idea how I a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 we have to use should I have 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.710
 no enemy comes now i believe it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.760
 has just been seen in the opponent 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.870
 Shit how do I find the knife knife 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.739
 used 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 hello , maybe I had a look 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.469
 should 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.670
 dictate the adversary 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.670
 okay, better 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:59.329
 First off because the alcohol is the knife me 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.960
 have found it 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:07.250
 so now there is hardly more 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.200
 that's when the fish fall I like this room 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.729
 Here I have already said so 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.409
 big enemy where I just heard something 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:26.320
 but that someone and of course I am 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:28.490
 well i'm good the music clearly 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 otherwise I am actually theoretical 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.460
 seen not once died 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.440
 is on this one time I'm just there 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.740
 that was also a dream now 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.960
 a bit much 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:46.899
 I could not do anything about it that way 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.899
 where are you now her sacks na 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.580

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.030
 I eliminated all boxers 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.620

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.500
 about the same number of dead 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.770

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.630
 another enemy 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.770
 I advise against it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.160
