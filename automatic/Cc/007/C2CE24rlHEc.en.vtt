00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.830
 very good to all people how is it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.230
 tito yes no box or if I'm a failure 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.970
 we continue with the skulls here we have 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.130
 the first one right in this stick here and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.320
 I already say cinema mode and we can not see it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.230
 but we're 100% sure that we have it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.820
 there we go with the next one that the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.730
 we have right here on the roof 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.589
 we shot the corner to pick it up and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 well the next thing we're going to have to 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.910
 to do is to come to us right here to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.150
 prestidigitation all to front where 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.829
 we have an electrocuted and good not 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.479
 electrocute as you know this only 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 it works like this we have removed the poster already 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.409
 that you have it in step 2 we throw everything 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.330
 to go forward in after light mode 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.430
 where we will have opened a new 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.900
 so well let's go back here 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.460
 and here we have the hole and right in the 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.170
 floor there will be a spoon that the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.149
 we will shoot until they are a laugh 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.939
 there you have the laughter and that means that 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.740
 we will have done it correctly and well 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.540
 once this is done we come to where 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.610
 titan to pick up another of the skulls 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.380
 that we have it there in the lamppost this is 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 the most fucked of all to catch already what 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.729
 I say good to me it cost me a couple of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.190
 attempts but usually cost more the truth 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.520
 and well, a little chiripa saved me 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.039
 he prepared me to throw it and Pima 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.530
 there is that we have picked it up sounds the 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.689
 giggle of I do not know who the fuck is but they're 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.310
 a laugh for the good and I recommend 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.990
 catch it with the gondola that is pretty 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.350
 easier once we are uploaded in 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.840
 she 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 and well finally the last thing we have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 to do is come to us to the cafeteria 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 Here I show you the way from press 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.150
 fingering we continue here we throw ourselves 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.549
 and here we have the cafeteria and what 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.470
 let's do it's going to be sparking 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.720
 the new spoon is worth it has left us 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 right on top of that table and so good 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.080
 sorry to give the sparks we have to 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 throw the tomahawk to pick it up like 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.860
 what we have done with the skulls or with 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.500
 the poster we throw tomahawks for 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 pick it up and you see that I think there 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.580
 a failure with the first but good after 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.220
 some attempt because the zombies 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.110
 fucking ourselves the truth not collect 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.120
 It is necessary to have the spoon of the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.239
 everything completes the golden spoon is that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.100
 that kills but good is recommended and not 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.730
 we are sure if it is mandatory for 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.560
 get the isstey but the truth that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.150
 we did it mainly to ensure 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.519
 no no and well I recommend that you 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.830
 do to ensure that the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.930
 easter and that this was our our 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.670
 procedure and well we what 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.890
 we did like that so as I say tomahawk 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.239
 there and we pick it up without any 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.640
 problem here you have the good try 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.440
 there we have it and well this has been the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.130
 today's step and see you in the next 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.610
