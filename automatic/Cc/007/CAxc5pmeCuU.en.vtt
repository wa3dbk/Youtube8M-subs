00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
of jewelry starting with models to molds

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.339 
of jewelry starting with models to molds
to<00:00:06.600> waxes<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.649> production<00:00:08.340> casting<00:00:09.260> here<00:00:10.260> are

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
to waxes to production casting here are

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.890 
to waxes to production casting here are
some<00:00:10.440> examples<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:12.059> models<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.780> be

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
some examples of the models that will be

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.550 
some examples of the models that will be
working<00:00:13.230> with<00:00:13.440> clay<00:00:13.830> models<00:00:14.309> made<00:00:15.120> by<00:00:15.560> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
working with clay models made by the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:31.730 
working with clay models made by the
designer<00:00:21.260> will<00:00:22.260> become<00:00:26.990> molds<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:30.500> then<00:00:31.500> when

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
designer will become molds and then when

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.440 
designer will become molds and then when
the<00:00:32.000> rubber<00:00:33.000> molds<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.630> cut<00:00:36.020> then<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.620> have

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
the rubber molds are cut then we have

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:49.630 
the rubber molds are cut then we have
waxes<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:43.730> when<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> waxes<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.300> finished

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:00.060 

we'll<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.670> production<00:00:51.149> cast<00:00:51.510> pieces

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.660 

make<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.100> nice<00:01:01.370> place<00:01:01.879> for<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:03.040> blacks<00:01:04.040> or<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
metal to flow using your wax pin then we

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.060 
metal to flow using your wax pin then we
will<00:01:21.040> fix<00:01:22.040> this<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.909> mold<00:01:23.119> frame<00:01:24.070> just

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
will fix this to the mold frame just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:35.219 
will fix this to the mold frame just
