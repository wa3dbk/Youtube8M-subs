00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.250
 today I present you a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.719
 classic the Chinese lady we saw 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 all full of different forms 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.170
 agree to a site that is a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.580
 as usual with a little game of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
 trip that will bend in the middle of 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.590
 indoor pawns and small pawns 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 like this okay it's a game we 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.570
 can play from 5 years old with a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130
 strategy rather that will evolve 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 as and when but against a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.329
 moving that is simple okay the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 goal of the game 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.410
 if I'm red here I'll try to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 take the place of blue sky okay 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.560
 before the blue sky will bring 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 their 10 pawns in my first triangle 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.940
 which takes the place of the one opposite to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.010
 win for moving 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 it's simple we play a single client at the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.550
 times and one hole at a time in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.950
 following the links I'm not entitled 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.960
 to go here director agree to this hole 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.250
 both a little pawn by a small 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.500
 lead to try to go faster 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 possible in France to go faster 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.700
 we have the right to jump over 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.899
 pawns or opposing pawns to go the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.579
 more possible ie that there the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.149
 red leather here would have the right to do 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:11.249
 this website clac agree ok without eating 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.420
 the opponent right now never the 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:12.929
 only thing is to go faster 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.240
 possible 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.729
 opposite if you arrive in a triangle 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.850
 before me had won we could have 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.189
 if we had this or the red 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.950
 starting being here you could have done 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.689
 what are you attacks 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.070
 make small flea jumps for them 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.079
 possible rain in phase so you 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.460
 will try to build your own 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.079
 bridge to try to go faster 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.850
 possible and if you see that 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.890
 the opponent regularly goes through a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.750
 place either you 're going stuck in 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.070
 making new pawn in the middle so it 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.720
 will not be able to do any more chip breaks 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.850
 either you shove one of your little pieces 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.990
 and so they can not reuse 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.840
 the same simple passages so that's 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.679
 the simple rule to play for 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.929
 to start 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.869
 pado okay let's start like this 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.849
 to raise the level of play gradually to 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.159
 measure we are going to have several 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.959
 possibilities ie we go if we 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.380
 always plays that person against one 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.509
 no one now I'm going 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.610
 take these two colors there against you 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.560
 these two colors the magic but ya plus 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.269
 15 years old still complicates you 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.500
 go take his three colors there and 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.900
 I 'm going to take his three colors 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.250
 okay we can complicate again 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.329
 that is to say that I will take 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.790
 three colors that are here 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.590
 against your three colors here then there 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.269
 do not hesitate to note everything it's really 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.870
 for the bitter gamers one of the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.630
 Chinese lady 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.030
 and note all the colors of 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.299
 start and where to land 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.180
 exactly agree if we are three 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.940
 players two possibilities be precisely 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.310
 we remove three pawns one you 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.560
 take off altogether and so every player 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.049
 must land but in a hole in a 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 triangle without pawns in front of agreement 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.800
 with a territory 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.629
 finally empty okay let's take two 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.159
 colors each no but if you take 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.989
 two colors each there are people 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.780
 everywhere just has a little bit more 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.720
 peace of mind if we are four we will 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.030
 eliminate two colors here are 5 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.319
 the youngest of the five or the one who plays 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.480
 less well or the one who is not 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.549
 accustomed will play precisely without pawns in 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.440
 face okay so we 'll have 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.810
 each colors to 6 we will take a 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.670
 color each one so we can raise one 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.370
 little bit the level of play and then 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.500
 especially we can vary the number of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.560
 players from 2 to 6 players and it was 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.120
 rather pretty enough a little two 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.680
 small precisions that is to say that we 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.480
 could raise the level of play for 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.700
 accelerate especially when we are two 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.109
 players 1 but even to 6 if you have 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.519
 the usual if everyone is used to 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.079
 to play like that is to say that we will 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.940
 to be able to play with symmetry 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.739
 that is to say that you will be able 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.050
 example there I give you an example on 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.800
 could be 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.410
 precisely here then there the red player 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.060
 could jump by red tulle here in 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.680
 respecting symmetry ie seen 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.480
 that there is a free hole here cum left 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.640
 a hole the mauritian island there is someone on 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.930
 will not be able to pass and land here and 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.970
 come out particles this one earth 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.330
 we have what we could do that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.760
 chord of agreement imagine how are you 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.370
 speed up the game so let's admit that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.860
 this one is was just one more 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.440
 little bit further this time it's 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.930
 to say he was there okay 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.880
 1 there are two free holes here if they are 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.920
 free I leave too much free there and 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.420
 I was successful and I do not eat 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.060
 that one I jump this one precisely 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.190
 that is to say as these clac clac in 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.730
 just one shot imagine how it's going 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.230
 greatly accelerated the game that's very 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.880
 nice if you do not have to start 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.380
 like that but very quickly you 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.610
 can play with symmetry a 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.130
 last small precision 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.340
 in all cases we are entitled 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.470
 to go into the triangle on if there is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.790
 empty holes to move and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.990
 to leave but we have not far from 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.300
 stop in a drama of triangles 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.490
 who who is not the one to reach 20 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.140
 neither his nor any of those one reaches 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.150
 okay that's when we just 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.360
 can try to make trips 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.520
 with swings pawns passing in 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.770
 the triangles 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.220
 sides but without ever stopping 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.590
 here are 2 to 6 players from 5 years 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.789
 but it's really enormously 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.870
 easy makes little flea jumps 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.199
 go faster 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.199
 in front
