things on it and but we'll have a look

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.619 
things on it and but we'll have a look
underneath<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.879> body<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.180> have<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.329> look<00:00:44.510> at

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
underneath the body and have a look at

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.799 
underneath the body and have a look at
what<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:45.199> made<00:00:45.289> up<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:46.210> okay<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.239> underneath

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
what it's made up of okay so underneath

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.240 
what it's made up of okay so underneath
the<00:00:47.930> canopy<00:00:48.109> you<00:00:48.320> will<00:00:48.559> see<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.980> there's<00:00:49.190> a

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
the canopy you will see that there's a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.860 
the canopy you will see that there's a
like<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.699> dust-covered<00:00:50.030> dirt<00:00:50.449> cover<00:00:50.690> this

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
like a dust-covered dirt cover this

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.869 
like a dust-covered dirt cover this
protects<00:00:51.350> or<00:00:51.890> adds<00:00:52.160> protection<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.789> the

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
protects or adds protection to the

protects or adds protection to the
electronics<00:00:53.329> underneath<00:00:53.629> I'll<00:00:54.620> just<00:00:54.739> tear

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
electronics underneath I'll just tear

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.160 
electronics underneath I'll just tear
that<00:00:54.949> off<00:00:55.070> as<00:00:55.250> well<00:00:58.690> here<00:00:59.690> we<00:00:59.750> can<00:00:59.870> see<00:01:00.019> how

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that off as well here we can see how

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.380 
that off as well here we can see how
it's<00:01:00.320> made<00:01:00.469> up<00:01:00.649> it's<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.160> looking<00:01:01.429> in<00:01:01.579> getting

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
it's made up it's a looking in getting

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.300 
it's made up it's a looking in getting

drive<00:01:22.100> system<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.850> very<00:01:23.060> fast<00:01:23.270> lots<00:01:23.600> of

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
drive system so very fast lots of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.260 
drive system so very fast lots of
traction<00:01:24.130> really<00:01:25.130> good<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.340> drive<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.060> at<00:01:26.180> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
traction really good to drive so at the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.520 
traction really good to drive so at the
back<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.570> vehicle<00:01:26.660> here<00:01:27.050> you'll<00:01:27.200> see<00:01:27.380> that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
back of the vehicle here you'll see that

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.290 
back of the vehicle here you'll see that
there's<00:01:27.710> sort<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.010> like<00:01:28.070> three<00:01:28.580> cutouts<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:29.210> a

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
there's sort of like three cutouts and a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.020 
there's sort of like three cutouts and a
strap<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:29.810> we'll<00:01:30.020> take<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.290> strap<00:01:30.530> off<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
strap so we'll take this strap off and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.580 
strap so we'll take this strap off and
there's<00:01:32.270> one<00:01:32.390> on<00:01:32.510> each<00:01:32.600> side<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.020> car<00:01:33.230> so

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
there's one on each side of the car so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.140 
there's one on each side of the car so
this<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.800> actually<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.190> battery<00:01:34.490> bag<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.970> it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
this is actually the battery bag and it

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.060 
this is actually the battery bag and it
uses<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.480> saddle<00:01:36.140> pack<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.500> two<00:01:36.560> separate

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
uses a saddle pack so two separate

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.000 
uses a saddle pack so two separate
batteries<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.970> wired<00:01:38.780> up<00:01:38.900> in<00:01:39.050> series<00:01:39.410> and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
batteries and wired up in series and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.910 
batteries and wired up in series and
that<00:01:40.340> simply<00:01:40.670> sits<00:01:40.910> into<00:01:41.060> there<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.800> that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
that simply sits into there and that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.500 
that simply sits into there and that
plugs<00:01:43.130> into<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.550> tamiya<00:01:43.970> connector<00:01:44.030> on<00:01:44.420> the

plugs into the tamiya connector on the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.420 
plugs into the tamiya connector on the
front<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:46.010> we<00:01:46.100> are<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.370> is

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
front of it so here we are this is

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.740 
front of it so here we are this is
everything<00:01:46.670> included<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.360> box<00:01:47.540> with<00:01:47.720> the
