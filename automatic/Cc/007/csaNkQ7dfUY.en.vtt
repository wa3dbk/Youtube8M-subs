want to show you how to go about
creating<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.690> custom<00:00:07.200> resolution<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:08.099> do

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
creating a custom resolution to do

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.270 
creating a custom resolution to do
something<00:00:08.880> called<00:00:09.090> down<00:00:09.389> sembly<00:00:10.130> for<00:00:11.130> those

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
something called down sembly for those

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.459 
something called down sembly for those
of<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.519> who<00:00:11.700> aren't<00:00:12.000> tech<00:00:12.389> savvy<00:00:12.690> basically

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
of you who aren't tech savvy basically

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.070 
of you who aren't tech savvy basically
down<00:00:14.130> sampling<00:00:14.639> allows<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.450> run<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> game

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
down sampling allows you to run a game

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.890 
down sampling allows you to run a game
at<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> higher<00:00:16.619> resolution<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.900> basically

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
at a higher resolution and basically

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.700 
at a higher resolution and basically
display<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.680> your<00:00:20.460> screen<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.590> make<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
display it to your screen and make it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.310 
display it to your screen and make it
look<00:00:22.800> prettier<00:00:23.660> for<00:00:24.660> those<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> who<00:00:25.170> are

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
look prettier for those of you who are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.529 
look prettier for those of you who are
tech<00:00:25.560> savvy<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.130> don't<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.359> go

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
tech savvy I don't think I need to go

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.970 
tech savvy I don't think I need to go
into<00:00:27.720> full<00:00:27.960> detail<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.560> pretty<00:00:28.710> sure<00:00:28.890> you

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
into full detail and pretty sure you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.609 
into full detail and pretty sure you
already<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.310> why<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> TLDR<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> is

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
already know why but the TLDR of it is

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.150 
already know why but the TLDR of it is
less<00:00:32.579> aliasing<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.960> screen<00:00:34.410> space<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
less aliasing and more screen space to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.119 
less aliasing and more screen space to
do<00:00:35.390> post-processing<00:00:36.390> effects<00:00:36.890> which<00:00:37.890> makes

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
do post-processing effects which makes

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.350 
do post-processing effects which makes
the<00:00:38.280> games<00:00:38.460> look<00:00:38.760> very<00:00:39.540> nice<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.430> don't

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the games look very nice so I don't

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.700 
the games look very nice so I don't
expect<00:00:42.629> many<00:00:42.930> people<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.440> through<00:00:43.620> this

it's<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.350> obsolete

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's this is going to be an obsolete

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
it's this is going to be an obsolete
method<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.489> both<00:01:05.670> methods<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.390> their<00:01:06.600> perks

and they both have their downsides so
again<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
again this is going to be just the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.520 
again this is going to be just the
custom<00:01:12.000> resolution<00:01:12.510> method<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> dsr

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
custom resolution method not the dsr

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
custom resolution method not the dsr
method<00:01:13.920> which<00:01:14.700> I'll<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:14.939> over<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.180> another

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
method which I'll go over in another

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.380 
method which I'll go over in another
video<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.490> started<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.299> to

and it's going to keep them at these
settings<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:52.350> settings

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769

go<00:02:53.190> higher<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.180> increases<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.019> pixel<00:02:55.380> clock

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
go higher and increases to pixel clock

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.840 
go higher and increases to pixel clock
and<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.250> can't<00:02:56.580> really<00:02:56.760> exceed<00:02:57.239> 164<00:02:58.200> Hertz

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
and you can't really exceed 164 Hertz

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.100 
and you can't really exceed 164 Hertz
but<00:02:59.850> again<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.330> this<00:03:00.420> case<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:00.989> really

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
but again in this case you don't really

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.620 
but again in this case you don't really
need<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.320> know<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:02.450> really<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.600> a

if you want to go over 1440p there is

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.640 
if you want to go over 1440p there is
really<00:03:58.970> only<00:03:59.180> two<00:03:59.660> sets<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.020> numbers<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.590> you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
really only two sets of numbers that you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.200 
really only two sets of numbers that you
probably<00:04:01.520> need<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.940> remember<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:04.210> pretty

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
probably need to remember this is pretty

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.660 
probably need to remember this is pretty
much<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.810> standard<00:04:06.470> number<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.340> I've<00:04:07.460> used

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
much a standard number that I've used

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.330 
much a standard number that I've used
across<00:04:08.050> four<00:04:09.050> or<00:04:09.200> five<00:04:09.440> different<00:04:09.680> types<00:04:10.100> of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
across four or five different types of

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.480 
across four or five different types of
panels<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.140> it's<00:04:12.140> worked<00:04:12.620> every<00:04:12.770> single<00:04:13.310> time

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
panels and it's worked every single time

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.580 
panels and it's worked every single time
so<00:04:14.030> these<00:04:14.660> are<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.870> numbers<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.260> like<00:04:15.440> to

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
so these are the numbers that I like to

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.670 
so these are the numbers that I like to
go<00:04:15.710> by<00:04:15.890> if<00:04:16.790> they<00:04:17.630> don't<00:04:17.810> work<00:04:17.900> for<00:04:18.170> yours

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
go by if they don't work for yours

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.880 
go by if they don't work for yours
then<00:04:19.209> if<00:04:20.209> you're<00:04:20.840> tech-savvy<00:04:21.260> then<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.739> can

you're not in tech savvy then I will

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.550 
you're not in tech savvy then I will
just<00:04:37.070> leave<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.280> at<00:04:37.370> 1440p<00:04:38.200> download<00:04:39.200> sampling

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
just leave it at 1440p download sampling

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.550 
just leave it at 1440p download sampling
from<00:04:39.710> 1440p<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.700> still<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.150> pretty<00:04:41.600> good<00:04:41.690> boost

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
from 1440p is still a pretty good boost

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.050 
from 1440p is still a pretty good boost
in<00:04:42.830> quality<00:04:43.280> especially<00:04:43.520> if<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.820> got<00:04:43.940> the

horsepower for it so moving on if you

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
want to go to 4k for example then this

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.660 
want to go to 4k for example then this
counts<00:04:50.660> for<00:04:50.780> any<00:04:50.930> resolution<00:04:51.470> above<00:04:51.710> 1440p

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.860 
counts for any resolution above 1440p
again<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.210> keep<00:04:53.420> that<00:04:53.600> in<00:04:53.690> mind<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:58.720> type<00:04:59.720> in

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
again so keep that in mind you type in

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.660 
again so keep that in mind you type in
4k<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:01.300> what<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.420> want<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.750> do<00:05:03.310> close<00:05:04.310> fraps

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
4k and what you want to do close fraps

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.240 
4k and what you want to do close fraps
there<00:05:04.910> it's<00:05:05.090> kind<00:05:05.330> of<00:05:05.390> getting<00:05:05.540> in<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.780> way

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
there it's kind of getting in the way

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.470 
there it's kind of getting in the way
it's<00:05:07.250> changed<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.760> total<00:05:08.060> pixels<00:05:08.480> to<00:05:09.010> 20/20

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
it's changed the total pixels to 20/20

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.760 
it's changed the total pixels to 20/20
around<00:05:11.480> there<00:05:11.690> you<00:05:12.350> can<00:05:12.470> go<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.590> little<00:05:12.650> bit

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
around there you can go a little bit

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.000 
around there you can go a little bit
higher<00:05:13.010> but<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.310> generally<00:05:13.970> do<00:05:14.240> 20<00:05:14.630> 20<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.050> 10

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
higher but I generally do 20 20 and 10

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.010 
higher but I generally do 20 20 and 10
90<00:05:16.430> now<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:16.730> reason<00:05:17.090> why<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.240> want<00:05:17.540> to<00:05:17.600> go<00:05:17.690> 20

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
90 now the reason why you want to go 20

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.560 
90 now the reason why you want to go 20
20<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:18.320> 10<00:05:18.530> 90<00:05:18.890> is<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.070> if<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:19.310> leave<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.790> too

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
20 and 10 90 is that if you leave it too

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.790 
20 and 10 90 is that if you leave it too
low<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.370> too<00:05:22.810> low<00:05:23.810> it's<00:05:24.020> just<00:05:24.230> like<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.530> few

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
low and too low it's just like a few

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.850 
low and too low it's just like a few
pixels<00:05:25.100> above<00:05:25.460> your<00:05:26.150> native<00:05:26.930> resolution<00:05:27.560> you

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
pixels above your native resolution you

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.590 
pixels above your native resolution you
have<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.430> stay<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.640> few<00:05:28.910> pixels<00:05:29.180> above<00:05:29.360> that

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
have to stay a few pixels above that

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.990 
have to stay a few pixels above that
otherwise<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.080> won't<00:05:30.260> work<00:05:32.170> this<00:05:33.170> lowers<00:05:33.590> your

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
otherwise it won't work this lowers your

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.640 
otherwise it won't work this lowers your
your<00:05:35.000> pixel<00:05:35.270> clock<00:05:35.420> and<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:36.110> makes<00:05:36.380> it

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
your pixel clock and that makes it

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.650 
your pixel clock and that makes it
compatible<00:05:37.220> with<00:05:38.770> your<00:05:39.770> display<00:05:40.390> so<00:05:41.390> again

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
compatible with your display so again

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.820 
compatible with your display so again
these<00:05:41.780> are<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.990> only<00:05:42.170> two<00:05:42.380> numbers<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.740> you

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
these are the only two numbers that you

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.740 
these are the only two numbers that you
need<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.070> change<00:05:43.330> just<00:05:44.330> change<00:05:44.510> your<00:05:44.600> from

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
need to change just change your from

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.000 
need to change just change your from
2200<00:05:45.170> to<00:05:45.470> 2020<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:47.590> forget<00:05:48.590> what<00:05:48.710> this<00:05:48.830> one

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
2200 to 2020 and I forget what this one

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.420 
2200 to 2020 and I forget what this one
was<00:05:49.190> just<00:05:49.400> changed<00:05:49.880> that<00:05:49.940> to<00:05:50.150> 1090<00:05:50.660> and<00:05:50.870> test

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.520 

and<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:57.060> can<00:05:57.240> see<00:05:57.449> that<00:05:57.630> obviously<00:05:58.289> it's<00:05:58.410> kind

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
and I can see that obviously it's kind

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.529 
and I can see that obviously it's kind
of<00:05:58.680> skewed<00:05:58.919> on<00:05:59.069> my<00:05:59.880> recording<00:06:00.300> software

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
of skewed on my recording software

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.420 
of skewed on my recording software
because<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.169> haven't<00:06:01.319> resized<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:02.009> but<00:06:02.190> you'll

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
because I haven't resized it but you'll

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.350 
because I haven't resized it but you'll
get<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.330> idea<00:06:03.360> once<00:06:03.930> you<00:06:04.080> see<00:06:04.259> it<00:06:04.349> yourself

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
get the idea once you see it yourself

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.210 
get the idea once you see it yourself
and<00:06:06.360> that's<00:06:07.199> pretty<00:06:07.380> much<00:06:07.500> all<00:06:07.710> there<00:06:07.860> is<00:06:07.919> to

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
and that's pretty much all there is to

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.409 
and that's pretty much all there is to
it<00:06:09.289> now<00:06:10.289> there<00:06:10.590> is<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> couple<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.520> downsides<00:06:11.759> to

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
it now there is a couple of downsides to

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.260 
it now there is a couple of downsides to
down<00:06:12.690> sampling<00:06:13.169> in<00:06:13.380> general<00:06:14.030> first<00:06:15.030> and

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
down sampling in general first and

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.969 
down sampling in general first and
foremost<00:06:15.660> isn't<00:06:15.930> that<00:06:16.020> not<00:06:16.199> all<00:06:16.470> games<00:06:16.770> are

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
foremost isn't that not all games are

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.520 
foremost isn't that not all games are
really<00:06:17.069> designed<00:06:17.550> for<00:06:17.880> higher<00:06:18.780> resolutions

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
really designed for higher resolutions

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.140 
really designed for higher resolutions
if<00:06:19.710> you<00:06:19.800> want<00:06:19.979> to<00:06:20.069> go<00:06:20.130> to<00:06:20.190> 4k<00:06:20.669> if<00:06:20.819> you've<00:06:20.940> got

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
if you want to go to 4k if you've got

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.950 
if you want to go to 4k if you've got
the<00:06:21.330> GPU<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:22.500> GPU<00:06:22.860> horsepower<00:06:23.310> for<00:06:23.610> that<00:06:23.960> you

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
the GPU the GPU horsepower for that you

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.629 
the GPU the GPU horsepower for that you
can<00:06:25.110> definitely<00:06:25.259> do<00:06:25.530> it<00:06:25.560> but<00:06:26.130> some<00:06:26.460> games

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
can definitely do it but some games

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.060 
can definitely do it but some games
don't<00:06:27.000> have<00:06:27.180> proper<00:06:27.570> UI<00:06:27.720> scaling<00:06:28.139> and<00:06:28.500> when

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 
in in some regards again it's it's

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.580 
in in some regards again it's it's

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:10.590
