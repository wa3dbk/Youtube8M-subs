00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.930
 hey people i want it sunny again 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.360
 You see, I have it here now 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.360
 brought my long fins and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.730
 possible stop just explain what 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.910
 puts it flowed the one in training 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.970
 what can you teach and what you can do with it 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 you should just buy at the fins 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.369
 eighth and let's start at times 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730
 So what sets and flows in training 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.470
 on 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210
 there you can divide as a bit 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 between grad in the beginner or 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 non-swimmer area I have myself 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.910
 Already at the university experienced that almost the same 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 when people from different sports 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 come to do the next debt 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600
 to have 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.210
 they are often in the jump joint 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 relatively immobile and it helps 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 The fin simply at the impact 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.280
 training in the movement training around there 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 just to develop a feeling 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 how the stabbing motion in the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.049
 Ankle looks like that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.869
 feels at all because of the big one 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.310
 surface of the fin just becomes the foot 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.619
 always moving in the direction and stuff 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.350
 you can just his movement there completely 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.650
 improve quickly 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 intensify the feeling and then 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.240
 even without a fins a better one 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 develop a better impact 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 The second effect is that just by 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.950
 This large area can be just one 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.240
 transfer much greater power to the water 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.400
 with the same movement and thereby lets 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.110
 Of course it is easier to get high 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.030
 generate speeds that is for 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.439
 One motivation was always easy 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.070
 is faster in the water than 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.020
 other 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.759
 That's why I always see myself too 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.649
 many are always free 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.700
 athletes generally go with them 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.619
 Float because they are easy 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.490
 Clear are clearer because I too 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.229
 make and but nothing is allowed 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.270
 fool 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.040
 through these fins you get 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.969
 Of course, an increase in power in the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.190
 Legs and some people are then off 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.940
 and once when they have flowed on 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.250
 will be with you 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.020
 I always fight so busy just when 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.710
 she just with the one with the fins 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.470
 begin 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.680
 Therefore, when buying on a few things 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.120
 You should always pay attention to that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.640
 Look that it follows with 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.790
 actually a consequence fin is this 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 almost soft here everywhere elastic 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.870
 may recognize the diver's fins 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.920
 the plastic just everywhere plastic 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.030
 have pulled through 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.850
 that makes the movement more difficult and more difficult 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.190
 causes much easier cramps 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.770
 because it's just not a soft liquid 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.140
 movement can become more, but that 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.850
 whole just stepped out of power and 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.560
 is ticked off and that is actually 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.050
 not what you can achieve in swimming 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.030
 you want a meat a soft one 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.190
 create fluid motion and it works 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.650
 just finish with one line and buy 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.110
 is there any of these things white wonder is de 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.700
 with the coupon but with the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.410
 discount code swim faster 10 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.780
 you get then still ten percent 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.610
 discount it is well worth it for you and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.709
 there is not any more 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.239
 Not with the product I have that is 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.190
 even an older floss you see is yes 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.920
 already done a lot it already 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.820
 over ten years old this is called 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.900
 things are always complete 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.020
 summer in the sun outside of 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.239
 any weather, if so from all 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.100
 weather was that was the thing already 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.640
 exposed and therefore the purchase 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.010
 worth it you can do a lot with it 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.540
 and have a look at the base 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.730
 many other useful products 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.040
 I will all my utensils after and 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.930
 to imagine what is important to what 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.019
 I have to pay attention 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.970
 and that was it up to one 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.850
 Fin will soon be a video 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.500
 give a comparison short floss short 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.920
 fins and land fins 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.239
 that 's just the difference and yes 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.709
 as far as you are hard at work 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.370
 next video and see you soon 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.370
 again ciao
