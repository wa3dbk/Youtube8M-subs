come we didn't box the entire frame a
lot<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> us<00:00:26.130> has<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> triangulation<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
lot of us has to do a triangulation and

I<00:00:28.050> learned<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> lot<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> triangulation

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I learned a lot of the triangulation

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.240 
I learned a lot of the triangulation
tips<00:00:30.119> from<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> other<00:00:31.439> show<00:00:31.740> which<00:00:32.009> I'll

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970 
explain in a minute but from this point
to<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.149> been<00:00:36.690> boxed<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.770> back

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to here it's been boxed from here back

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.030 
to here it's been boxed from here back
is<00:00:38.340> where<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.540> original<00:00:39.989> yoke<00:00:40.260> went<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
is where the original yoke went and I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030 
is where the original yoke went and I
have<00:00:41.280> mounts<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:42.989> leaf<00:00:43.200> spring<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
have mounts for my leaf spring so if I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
have mounts for my leaf spring so if I
box<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.239> ever<00:00:45.360> needed<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> change

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
box that in if I ever needed to change

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.190 
box that in if I ever needed to change
that<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.559> I'd<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:47.010> screwed<00:00:48.050> then<00:00:49.050> it's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that out I'd be screwed then it's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.490 
that out I'd be screwed then it's
connected<00:00:49.680> 10<00:00:49.890> inches<00:00:50.190> back<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:52.320> new

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
connected 10 inches back to the the new

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
connected 10 inches back to the the new
motor<00:00:52.739> mount<00:00:53.039> which<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.789> put<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.500> see

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
motor mount which we put in you can see

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439 
motor mount which we put in you can see
over<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:55.890> joint<00:00:56.399> i<00:00:56.579> put<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.969> vertical

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
over here joint i put in vertical

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
over here joint i put in vertical
supports<00:00:57.960> behind<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.840> actual<00:01:01.340> surface

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
supports behind it so the actual surface

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.020 
supports behind it so the actual surface
area<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> only<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:05.030> that's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
area is only from here to here that's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
area is only from here to here that's
not<00:01:06.270> boxed<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.869> everything<00:01:07.320> else<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
not boxed and everything else is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
not boxed and everything else is
triangulated<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.840> why<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> didn't<00:01:10.380> box

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
triangulated so that's why I didn't box

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
triangulated so that's why I didn't box
it<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.400> only<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.820> didn't<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it in not only that I didn't have a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
it in not only that I didn't have a
whole<00:01:12.840> bunch<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.200> metal<00:01:13.350> disparate<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.130> plus

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
whole bunch of metal disparate and plus

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
whole bunch of metal disparate and plus
I<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.880> been<00:01:15.000> screwing<00:01:15.390> myself<00:01:15.600> by

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I would have been screwing myself by

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
I would have been screwing myself by
covering<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.430> why<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
covering it all up so that's why I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
covering it all up so that's why I
didn't<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.270> here's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.200> update
