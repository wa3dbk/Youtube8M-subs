submariner i think is the perfect choice
now<00:04:17.430> whether<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.849> go<00:04:18.000> ceramic<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:18.840> or<00:04:19.590> pre

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.430 
now whether you go ceramic or or pre
ceramic<00:04:20.700> doesn't<00:04:21.389> really<00:04:21.630> matter<00:04:21.989> but<00:04:22.289> I
