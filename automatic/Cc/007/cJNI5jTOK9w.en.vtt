for<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.720> demonstration<00:00:27.989> and<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:29.250> going

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
for this demonstration and we're going

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
for this demonstration and we're going

to hit control 6 or command 6 on a Mac

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
to hit control 6 or command 6 on a Mac
to<00:00:32.279> bring<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.820> lens<00:00:33.120> correction<00:00:33.600> panel<00:00:33.930> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
to bring up our lens correction panel on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
to bring up our lens correction panel on
the<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.350> side<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> expand<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:35.970> least

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the right side or to expand it at least

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
the right side or to expand it at least
and<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.410> over<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.680> first<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.130> two

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and let's go over the first the two

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
and let's go over the first the two
options<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.720> either<00:00:39.840> make

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
options that we have we can either make

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
options that we have we can either make
lens<00:00:40.320> corrections<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:41.010> profile<00:00:41.610> or<00:00:41.850> manually

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
lens corrections by profile or manually

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
lens corrections by profile or manually
now<00:00:42.990> what<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> profile<00:00:43.530> means<00:00:43.740> is<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.890> it's

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
now what a profile means is that it's

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220 
now what a profile means is that it's
going<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.310> automatically<00:00:44.790> detect<00:00:45.230> which

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
going to automatically detect which

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290 
going to automatically detect which
camera<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.130> lens<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.580> we<00:00:47.670> used<00:00:48.030> when

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
camera and which lens that we used when

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
camera and which lens that we used when
we<00:00:48.360> shot<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.720> image<00:00:48.900> from<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.290> metadata<00:00:49.740> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
we shot this image from the metadata and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
we shot this image from the metadata and
then<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> basically<00:00:51.030> correct<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
then it's going to basically correct the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
then it's going to basically correct the
distortion<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> lensman<00:00:53.640> getting<00:00:53.970> all

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
distortion and the lensman getting all

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.510 
distortion and the lensman getting all
on<00:00:54.300> its<00:00:54.450> own<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.380> we<00:00:55.470> click<00:00:55.560> enable<00:00:56.130> profile

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
on its own so if we click enable profile

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040 
on its own so if we click enable profile
corrections<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.270> automatically<00:00:57.690> detects

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
corrections it automatically detects

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.430 
corrections it automatically detects
that<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.380> shot<00:00:58.560> this<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:58.860> cannon<00:00:59.310> with<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.440> 24

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that we shot this on a cannon with a 24

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
that we shot this on a cannon with a 24
to<00:01:01.530> 70<00:01:01.860> lens<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.150> use<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to 70 lens and it's going to use this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.130 
to 70 lens and it's going to use this
adobe<00:01:03.890> 2470<00:01:04.890> profile<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:06.000> correct<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
adobe 2470 profile to correct all of the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.569 
adobe 2470 profile to correct all of the
distortion<00:01:07.710> everything<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.070> image<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
distortion everything on image and

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.580 
distortion everything on image and
actually<00:01:09.150> does<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> pretty<00:01:09.390> decent<00:01:09.869> job<00:01:09.900> too<00:01:10.350> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
actually does a pretty decent job too so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
actually does a pretty decent job too so
if<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.829> look<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> edges<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.909> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
if we look at the edges we can see that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.399 
if we look at the edges we can see that
it's<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> bending<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> flattening<00:01:13.320> out

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's kind of bending and flattening out

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.809 
it's kind of bending and flattening out
the<00:01:13.470> horizon<00:01:13.890> line<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.009> bit<00:01:14.280> it's

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:14.819 
the horizon line a bit it's

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.309 
the horizon line a bit it's
straightening<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.539> poles<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.079> left

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
straightening up these poles on the left

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.230 
straightening up these poles on the left
side<00:01:16.469> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> image<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.670> bad<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.149> it's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
side of the image it's not bad and it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.609 
side of the image it's not bad and it's
also<00:01:18.329> correcting<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.079> vignette<00:01:19.409> as

this massive list of lenses that it has

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
this massive list of lenses that it has
for<00:01:38.039> every<00:01:38.249> single<00:01:38.549> basically<00:01:38.759> counter<00:01:39.659> maker

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
for every single basically counter maker

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.379 
of here and let's go to the other option
for<00:01:47.189> making<00:01:47.399> lens<00:01:47.549> Corrections<00:01:47.969> which<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
for making lens Corrections which is to

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.239 
for making lens Corrections which is to
do<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> manually<00:01:49.109> so<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:49.889> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.039> turn<00:01:50.219> off

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
do it manually so I'm going to turn off

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.190 
do it manually so I'm going to turn off
the<00:01:50.549> enable<00:01:50.969> profile<00:01:51.299> Corrections<00:01:51.869> we're

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the enable profile Corrections we're

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
the enable profile Corrections we're
going<00:01:52.289> to<00:01:52.409> switch<00:01:52.590> back<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> manual<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> now

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
going to switch back to manual and now

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.419 
going to switch back to manual and now
we<00:01:54.179> have<00:01:54.359> basically<00:01:54.779> and<00:01:55.170> manual<00:01:55.889> controls

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
we have basically and manual controls

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.309 
we have basically and manual controls
for<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> different<00:01:57.479> adjustments<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
for all of the different adjustments to

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.469 
for all of the different adjustments to
transform<00:01:58.889> and<00:01:59.100> correct<00:01:59.819> distortion<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.329> our

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
transform and correct distortion on our

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.539 
transform and correct distortion on our
lens<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.499> have<00:02:01.619> distortion<00:02:02.100> adjustment

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
lens so we have distortion adjustment

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.859 
lens so we have distortion adjustment
where<00:02:02.639> we<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.789> drag<00:02:02.999> the<00:02:03.209> left<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.749> right

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
where we can drag the left and the right

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.589 
where we can drag the left and the right
we<00:02:04.709> have<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> vertical<00:02:05.399> adjustment<00:02:05.729> for

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
we have a vertical adjustment for

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.540 
we have a vertical adjustment for
correcting<00:02:06.959> vertical<00:02:07.349> distortion<00:02:07.799> for

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
correcting vertical distortion for

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
correcting vertical distortion for
correcting<00:02:09.030> horizontal<00:02:09.630> distortion<00:02:10.110> for

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
correcting horizontal distortion for

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.020 
correcting horizontal distortion for
correcting<00:02:10.890> rotations<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.880> even

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
correcting rotations so we can even

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.600 
correcting rotations so we can even
rotate<00:02:12.150> our<00:02:12.450> image<00:02:12.800> we<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:13.920> correct<00:02:14.099> for

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
rotate our image we can correct for

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.880 
rotate our image we can correct for
scale<00:02:15.150> which<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.200> basically<00:02:16.440> going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.650> shrink

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
scale which is basically going to shrink

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.010 
scale which is basically going to shrink
down<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.190> image<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.610> whatever<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.780> on

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
down the image and whatever you see on

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.480 
down the image and whatever you see on
this<00:02:19.140> gray<00:02:19.470> side<00:02:19.710> remember<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.190> talked<00:02:20.370> about

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
this gray side remember we talked about

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.070 
this gray side remember we talked about
basically<00:02:20.880> when<00:02:21.210> during<00:02:21.540> your<00:02:21.690> cropping<00:02:21.930> tool

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
basically when during your cropping tool

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.070 
basically when during your cropping tool
we<00:02:22.410> are<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.770> your

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
we are in your

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.900 
we are in your
up<00:02:23.140> overlay<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.430> an<00:02:24.520> option<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
up overlay you have an option to

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.480 
up overlay you have an option to
constrain<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.780> warp<00:02:26.050> if<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.890> select<00:02:27.100> this

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
constrain to warp if you select this

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.580 
constrain to warp if you select this
then<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.030> automatically<00:02:28.480> crops<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:29.020> on<00:02:29.350> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
then it automatically crops in on the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.650 
then it automatically crops in on the
area<00:02:29.710> where<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.220> image<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.360> basically

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
area where the image is so basically

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.450 
area where the image is so basically
that<00:02:31.780> gray<00:02:32.080> area<00:02:32.110> on<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.800> edges<00:02:33.130> they'll<00:02:33.310> get

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
that gray area on the edges they'll get

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.040 
that gray area on the edges they'll get
cropped<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:33.850> automatically<00:02:34.450> by<00:02:34.690> selecting

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
cropped out automatically by selecting

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.990 
cropped out automatically by selecting
this<00:02:35.110> constraint<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.620> warp<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.610> exact

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
this constraint of warp it's the exact

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.610 
this constraint of warp it's the exact
same<00:02:37.030> option<00:02:37.660> down<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:38.170> when<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.470> have

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
same option down here when you have

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.590 
same option down here when you have
constrained<00:02:39.100> crop<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.030> turn<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
constrained crop so you can turn on and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.810 
constrained crop so you can turn on and
off<00:02:40.720> from<00:02:40.990> either<00:02:41.170> place<00:02:41.440> by<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> way<00:02:42.550> if<00:02:42.700> we

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
off from either place by the way if we

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.190 
off from either place by the way if we
can<00:02:42.970> if<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.210> don't<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.720> constrained

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
can if we don't have that constrained

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.290 
can if we don't have that constrained
crop<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.490> we<00:02:45.580> make<00:02:45.730> adjustments

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
crop on and then we make adjustments

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.730 
crop on and then we make adjustments
here<00:02:46.510> then<00:02:46.810> basically<00:02:46.990> when<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.350> print<00:02:47.560> this

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
here then basically when we print this

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.650 
here then basically when we print this
image<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.460> have<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.970> great<00:02:49.240> border

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
image we will have this great border

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.170 
image we will have this great border
wherever<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.410> shows<00:02:50.590> up<00:02:50.800> on<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.070> preview<00:02:51.520> so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
wherever it shows up on this preview so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.700 
wherever it shows up on this preview so
if<00:02:52.330> for<00:02:52.480> example<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.810> adjust<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.200> distortion

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
if for example we adjust the distortion

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.290 
if for example we adjust the distortion
not<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.250> how<00:02:54.760> much<00:02:54.880> you'd<00:02:55.060> want<00:02:55.210> to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
not that this is how much you'd want to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.550 
not that this is how much you'd want to
go<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:55.570> if<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.750> go<00:02:55.870> up<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.200> point<00:02:56.350> where

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
go but if you go up to the point where

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.110 
go but if you go up to the point where
you<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.770> see<00:02:57.010> these<00:02:57.160> gray<00:02:57.460> edges<00:02:57.730> at<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.910> top

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
you can see these gray edges at the top

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.570 
you can see these gray edges at the top
and<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.360> bottom<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:59.410> need<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.830> constrain<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
and the bottom you need to constrain the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.340 
and the bottom you need to constrain the
crop<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.300> basically<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.930> don't<00:03:02.140> see

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
crop so that basically you don't see

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.370 
crop so that basically you don't see
those<00:03:02.470> areas<00:03:02.920> when<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.520> export<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> image

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
those areas when you export the image

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.510 
those areas when you export the image
alright<00:03:05.380> guys<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.680> let's<00:03:05.770> reset<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.340> i'm

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
alright guys so let's reset this i'm

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.010 
alright guys so let's reset this i'm
going<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.700> hold<00:03:06.790> down<00:03:06.910> alt<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.420> hit<00:03:07.660> reset

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
going to hold down alt and hit reset

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.780 
going to hold down alt and hit reset
transform<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:08.890> goes<00:03:09.040> back<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.400> how<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.670> was

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
transform so it goes back to how it was

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.210 
transform so it goes back to how it was
originally<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:11.170> option<00:03:11.800> on<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.950> Mac<00:03:12.070> by

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
originally that's option on the Mac by

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.460 
originally that's option on the Mac by
the<00:03:12.280> way<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.640> let's<00:03:13.630> go<00:03:13.750> down<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.930> lens

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the way and let's go down to lens

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.900 
the way and let's go down to lens
vignetting<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:15.340> there's<00:03:15.550> two<00:03:15.730> different

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
vignetting now there's two different

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.390 
vignetting now there's two different
types<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.420> lens<00:03:16.690> vignette<00:03:17.050> adjustments<00:03:17.650> one

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
types of lens vignette adjustments one

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.640 
types of lens vignette adjustments one
is<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.670> basically<00:03:19.420> an<00:03:19.600> effect<00:03:19.990> which<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.380> post

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
is a basically an effect which is a post

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.490 
is a basically an effect which is a post
crop<00:03:20.890> vignette<00:03:21.310> one<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.600> lens<00:03:22.990> correction

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
crop vignette one is a lens correction

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.130 
crop vignette one is a lens correction
effect<00:03:23.800> which<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.280> what<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.670> see<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.150> now

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
effect which is what you see here now

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.259 
effect which is what you see here now
for<00:03:26.500> artistic<00:03:26.830> purposes<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.489> actually<00:03:28.000> use

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
for artistic purposes we actually use

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.030 
for artistic purposes we actually use
the<00:03:28.630> lens<00:03:28.810> been<00:03:28.989> getting<00:03:29.260> effect<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.739> lens

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
the lens been getting effect in the lens

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.160 
the lens been getting effect in the lens
Corrections<00:03:30.580> more<00:03:31.300> than<00:03:31.450> anything<00:03:31.630> else<00:03:31.930> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
Corrections more than anything else and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.110 
Corrections more than anything else and
the<00:03:32.320> reason<00:03:32.590> why<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.739> because<00:03:32.860> this<00:03:33.790> vignette

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the reason why is because this vignette

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.420 
the reason why is because this vignette
effect<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.630> very<00:03:34.690> subtle<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:36.070> very<00:03:36.250> nice

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
effect is very subtle and it's very nice

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.740 
effect is very subtle and it's very nice
and<00:03:36.640> it's<00:03:36.760> just<00:03:36.970> designed<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.480> actually

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and it's just designed to actually

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.240 
and it's just designed to actually
correct<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.320> vignette<00:03:38.560> that's<00:03:38.830> natural<00:03:39.190> in

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
correct the vignette that's natural in

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.520 
correct the vignette that's natural in
your<00:03:39.340> lens<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.570> does<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.959> brightens

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
your lens so all it does is brightens

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.800 
your lens so all it does is brightens
and<00:03:41.739> darkens<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.400> edge<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.760> an<00:03:42.910> image<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.480> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and darkens the edge of an image and the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.360 
and darkens the edge of an image and the
amount<00:03:44.080> just<00:03:44.260> controls<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> strength<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.280> if

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
amount just controls the strength so if

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.890 
amount just controls the strength so if
I<00:03:45.459> go<00:03:45.489> higher<00:03:45.880> it's<00:03:46.180> going<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.360> brighten<00:03:46.750> and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
I go higher it's going to brighten and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.690 
I go higher it's going to brighten and
if<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.050> go<00:03:47.170> lower<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.739> darken<00:03:47.920> if<00:03:48.250> I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
if I go lower it's going to darken if I

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.340 
if I go lower it's going to darken if I
pull<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.090> midpoint<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.690> left<00:03:49.959> it's<00:03:50.200> going

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
pull the midpoint to the left it's going

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.320 
pull the midpoint to the left it's going
to<00:03:50.410> pull<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.860> basically<00:03:51.580> pull<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.970> center

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
to pull that basically pull the center

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.790 
to pull that basically pull the center
of<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.600> vignette<00:03:52.840> effect<00:03:53.019> all<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.590> way<00:03:53.680> into

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
of the vignette effect all the way into

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.740 
of the vignette effect all the way into
the<00:03:53.950> middle<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.310> image<00:03:54.610> whereas<00:03:55.570> if<00:03:55.660> I

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
the middle of the image whereas if I

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.970 
the middle of the image whereas if I
pull<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.230> other<00:03:56.380> side<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.830> only

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
pull it to the other side it only

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.790 
pull it to the other side it only
affects<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.610> edges<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.870> works<00:03:59.290> not<00:03:59.620> only

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
affects the edges so it works not only

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.740 
affects the edges so it works not only
for<00:04:00.100> correcting<00:04:00.700> natural<00:04:01.209> vignetting<00:04:01.600> but

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
for correcting natural vignetting but

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.449 
for correcting natural vignetting but
for<00:04:01.900> also<00:04:02.019> creating<00:04:02.530> artistic<00:04:03.070> lensman

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
for also creating artistic lensman

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.310 
for also creating artistic lensman
getting<00:04:03.670> effects<00:04:04.000> new<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.660> Lightroom<00:04:04.930> 4<00:04:05.140> we

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
getting effects new to Lightroom 4 we

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.870 
getting effects new to Lightroom 4 we
have<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> option<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.920> correct<00:04:06.250> d<00:04:06.400> fringing

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
have the option to correct d fringing

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.160 
have the option to correct d fringing
and<00:04:07.030> basically<00:04:07.570> what<00:04:07.690> it's<00:04:07.810> going<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> do<00:04:08.080> is

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
and basically what it's going to do is

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.540 
and basically what it's going to do is
it<00:04:08.260> gives<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> two<00:04:08.650> options<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:09.190> correct<00:04:09.459> d

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
it gives you two options to correct d

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.100 
it gives you two options to correct d
fringing<00:04:09.940> along<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.269> highlight<00:04:10.630> h's<00:04:10.930> or

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
fringing along the highlight h's or

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.440 
fringing along the highlight h's or
along<00:04:11.560> all<00:04:11.769> edges<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:12.730> let's<00:04:12.910> selecting<00:04:13.360> one

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
along all edges so let's selecting one

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.610 
along all edges so let's selecting one
of<00:04:13.480> these<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:13.780> going<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> automatically<00:04:14.380> d

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
of these is going to automatically d

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.229 
of these is going to automatically d

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
fringing before was kind of those dark

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.150 
fringing before was kind of those dark
black<00:04:19.720> areas<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.169> you<00:04:20.260> get<00:04:20.500> along<00:04:20.769> highlight

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
black areas that you get along highlight

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.430 
black areas that you get along highlight
edges<00:04:21.519> so<00:04:22.210> it's<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.390> really<00:04:22.570> nice<00:04:22.780> kind<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.229> tool

clarity<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.960> an<00:04:29.050> image<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.650> get<00:04:29.800> that

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
clarity to an image and you get that

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.040 
clarity to an image and you get that
fringe<00:04:30.250> look<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.210> we<00:04:31.330> have<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:31.630> kind<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:31.870> lens

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
fringe look so we have that kind of lens

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.719 
fringe look so we have that kind of lens
correction<00:04:32.410> as<00:04:32.500> well<00:04:32.710> in<00:04:32.979> our<00:04:33.460> lens

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
