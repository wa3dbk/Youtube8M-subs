dripping over the overflow so that it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.710 
dripping over the overflow so that it
goes<00:02:42.510> from<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.489> sump<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.700> make<00:02:45.299> sure<00:02:45.510> that

goes from the sump and make sure that
there's<00:02:45.900> no<00:02:46.079> leaks<00:02:46.850> check<00:02:47.850> once<00:02:48.750> checked

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the pump okay all right so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.300 
the pump okay all right so
you<00:02:56.600> think<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.020> you<00:02:57.170> check<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.709> null<00:02:57.890> for

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
you think that you check the null for

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.120 
you think that you check the null for
leaks<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.850> whatever<00:02:59.260> so<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.319> went<00:03:00.709> ahead<00:03:00.800> and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
leaks and whatever so you went ahead and

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
not so fast in both because we need to

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.250 
not so fast in both because we need to
our<00:03:05.780> first<00:03:06.080> try<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:07.569> just<00:03:08.569> plug<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.080> main

in<00:03:43.910> there<00:03:44.060> with<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.300> aviation<00:03:44.900> we're<00:03:45.440> going

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
in there with the aviation we're going

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.830 
in there with the aviation we're going
to<00:03:45.590> put<00:03:45.769> them<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:45.980> bags<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:47.480> reason<00:03:47.750> why

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
to put them in bags and the reason why

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.090 
to put them in bags and the reason why
we<00:03:47.989> want<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.200> put<00:03:48.350> them<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.500> back<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.950> because

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
we want to put them in back is because

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.830 
we want to put them in back is because
still<00:03:49.700> there<00:03:49.910> is<00:03:50.030> going<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.269> be<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:50.390> tempered

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
still there is going to be a tempered

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.080 
still there is going to be a tempered
temperature<00:03:51.560> differential<00:03:52.220> unless<00:03:52.940> you're

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
temperature differential unless you're

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.170 
temperature differential unless you're
really<00:03:53.330> really<00:03:53.600> good<00:03:54.730> time<00:03:55.730> then<00:03:55.910> what<00:03:56.030> we're

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
really really good time then what we're

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.610 
really really good time then what we're
going<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.360> do<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.630> float<00:03:56.840> them<00:03:57.019> just<00:03:57.319> as<00:03:57.470> if

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
going to do is float them just as if

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.740 
going to do is float them just as if
they<00:03:57.769> just<00:03:57.800> came<00:03:58.130> from<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.459> store<00:03:58.730> into<00:03:59.630> the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
they just came from a store into the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.420 
they just came from a store into the
main<00:03:59.930> tank<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.700> voila<00:04:01.700> should<00:04:02.630> be<00:04:02.780> about<00:04:02.989> them

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.440

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.219 
the move is finally done we release the

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.179 
the move is finally done we release the

now<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.639> few<00:04:20.669> hours<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.570> water<00:04:21.780> will

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
now but in a few hours the water will

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.469 
now but in a few hours the water will
clear<00:04:22.289> up<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:23.190> temperature<00:04:23.580> will<00:04:23.970> start<00:04:24.300> rise

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
clear up the temperature will start rise

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.740 
clear up the temperature will start rise
into<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.350> normal<00:04:26.330> point<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:29.750> everything

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
into the normal point and everything

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.600 
into the normal point and everything
should<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:30.990> fine<00:04:31.130> again<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.280> know<00:04:32.400> it's

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
should be fine again you know it's

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.510 
should be fine again you know it's
pretty<00:04:33.270> dirty<00:04:33.419> on<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.780> outside<00:04:34.110> or<00:04:34.259> whatever

that piles up onto the substrate and on
the<00:04:39.449> rock<00:04:39.660> work<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.229> let<00:04:41.099> it<00:04:41.130> be<00:04:41.250> for<00:04:41.639> right<00:04:41.820> now

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
the rock work so let it be for right now

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.140 
the rock work so let it be for right now
you<00:04:42.570> know<00:04:42.690> let<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.080> fish<00:04:43.669> get<00:04:44.669> okay<00:04:44.970> with

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
you know let the fish get okay with

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.969 
you know let the fish get okay with
their<00:04:45.300> environment<00:04:45.539> again<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.320> then<00:04:46.500> up<00:04:46.949> here

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
their environment again and then up here

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.939 
their environment again and then up here
a<00:04:47.370> day<00:04:48.000> or<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.270> come<00:04:49.139> back<00:04:49.320> with<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.560> turkey

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
work and of the substrate as much as you

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.230 
work and of the substrate as much as you
have<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.419> when<00:04:57.599> you<00:04:57.720> do<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.699> be<00:04:59.699> careful<00:05:00.090> not

much as you can suspend it back into the
water<00:05:07.770> like<00:05:08.580> this<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.210> you<00:05:09.360> can<00:05:09.599> actually
