00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 listen we have we are in the party of 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.090
 the point of noon descended the valley 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.120
 white is meant to us that the axÃ© 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.009
 the best in winter there this phase is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.980
 it was to go through the pass of 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.960
 swallows so a big first 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.550
 day so December of the white year 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.510
 and then back up the eze pass 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 swallows we hesitated to learn from 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.699
 chutes and finally we climbed 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.190
 right in the cerac is not happening 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.769
 too bad in fact 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 then we dress voice that is at the foot 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:45.140
 of the base beyond the phase is so 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 it was the first day then 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.549
 then the base the next day 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.080
 so it's rather mist with only 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:01:01.650
 a slab length then cdc 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.250
 mixed ingredients same ktm 5 has not yielded 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.270
 his classics and then that brings us to the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.790
 turn of the face is enough 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 characteristic so this phase is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 worried who is really wild and can 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.910
 Browse 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.060
 that's really what motivated us 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.600
 which this last niche of various 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.370
 we said this is really the opportunity 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.930
 to go to visit a little bit 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.700
 this phase is is so we fixed 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.920
 three lengths this second day 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:38.310
 in it's done 1-1 by gold of 300 net 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.970
 its six sides ba3 and length the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.770
 length of the 3c a big you to pass 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:50.190
 so that's it we've been busy the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.900
 second day we finally managed the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.900
 third day actually we go out 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.200
 the third day of this famous big 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.760
 wall so there I saw these pictures myself 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.800
 some things the morning after 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.300
 yeah that's it compared to 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.190
 say the big advantage over the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.810
 north face of the big jorasses it is 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.750
 really it's 2h30 3h of sun 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.350
 allow to leave the said broken voice 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.070
 quite easily 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.690
 and then especially especially monks 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.060
 had a pair of slippers 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.120
 made us move a little bit 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.960
 faster so that's it happens it's not 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.850
 badly huh it's not bad and so the output 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.130
 then once we got out these 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.820
 difficulties we have two hundred 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.950
 fifty matt climbed into dumiste not 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.070
 not really hard we are relatively 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 rotten we'll say so do you when 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.260
 even to his gaffes and then that we 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.570
 brings on the edge of the cutter and the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.580
 soon enough we end up at the top of 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.600
 the tip to good and level 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.430
 equipment you will find some 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.380
 so material can very little 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 of equipment so that's a way that has 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.480
 was opened in 1983 by two guides two 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.870
 brothers fabio and cristiano of them is there 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.849
 we will say that for the time he had 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.890
 still very well engaged we found 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.040
 I believe an old frese stuck in a 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.480
 crack but overall they left 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.110
 they left it clean and its 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.700
 pure lines and well engaged and its 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.090
 obvious nights inserting to be there 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.480
 clear sanitation 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.230
 a nice to be there with 2.2 you from you 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.769
 aline spent concludes go I mean 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 to reveal hyper obvious what and so 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.310
 you will find no one 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.260
 historical on this path priori the not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.230
 everything and you repeat way pretty little 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.910
 of history sees the fact that this is the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.160
 first winter we are in 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.730
 huge boxes sure after we try to 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.440
 to find even if it had been repeated 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.230
 even in the summer for the moment we have not 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.569
 too much info have any matter of any 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.569
 way what is sure is that that's it 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.370
 deserves it deserves to be put to the 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.739
 taste of the day this phase is and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.720
 especially this way but rather in 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.870
 winter then you think seen the base and the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.419
 exit yeah well let's say that after summer 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.510
 there is a little hesitated this pedestal by the way 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.090
 by the colossus at the edge of the swallows 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.840
 and then joined the vire but that's 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.450
 true that in winter in winter I think 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.760
 it's a bit more breadth in that 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.990
 from the bottom like that it's a hit 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.220
 it makes a voice of 800 m so it's 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.630
 still nice what 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.010
 it's in this phase and how much 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.300
 other channels are found all my 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.849
 lease to the classic 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.970
 gervasutti then there are two ways that 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.680
 were opened 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.000
 I do not know exactly how many 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.470
 but but 2nd what is certain is that 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.990
 is that my opinion still of the place 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.680
 to do something but that's where 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.509
 it is the most beautiful what it is there low 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.210
 yes in my opinion it is one of the most beautiful 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.759
 because the line the line the obvious 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.710
 before the end of May some photos that 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.479
 show that they spent there and the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.340
 diesel it's beautiful a it's clear 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.620
 it's really not pulled by the 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.199
 hair these two very beautiful lines you 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.469
 were a little bit busy anyway 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.560
 necessarily when we speak for we were 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.520
 left on four bivouac 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.039
 because we thought we were going back to 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.960
 boccalatte and finally we managed to 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.000
 go down in a trench from the top of the 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.789
 walcker tip down let's remember 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.800
 finally heaven we had enough conditions 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:42.020
 pretty good since it within his reach well 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.000
 we heard that no one did when 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.190
 even three bivouacs so with gear 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.940
 artificially inevitably enough 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.180
 quickly with bags and at 30 30 35 kg 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.460
 per person necessarily but hey it's a 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.009
 little price for winter in this 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.569
 in this kind of place and just for 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.789
 finish a small dot on the mast such as 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.160
 we took technical level 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.860
 material we had 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.340
 had two fresnes play games 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.110
 complete with a lot of little aliens 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.300
 and about twenty hospitals 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.380
 so we have a lot of pitons 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.000
 in the second length of at 3 1 3 where 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.890
 the aca in python I think I think 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.090
 that you do not have so it is absolutely necessary 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.090
 pythons
