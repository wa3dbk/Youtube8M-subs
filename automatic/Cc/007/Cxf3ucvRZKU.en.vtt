I'm going to show you now how to finish
this<00:00:06.740> project<00:00:07.149> by<00:00:08.149> using<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:08.840> grafting

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
this project by using the grafting

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.820 
this project by using the grafting
method<00:00:10.309> so<00:00:11.180> we're<00:00:11.389> going<00:00:11.570> to<00:00:11.840> make<00:00:12.139> all<00:00:12.620> the

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
method so we're going to make all the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.690 
method so we're going to make all the
stitches<00:00:13.340> onto<00:00:14.330> two<00:00:15.080> needles<00:00:15.469> an<00:00:15.800> even<00:00:16.369> number

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
stitches onto two needles an even number

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.330 
stitches onto two needles an even number
amount<00:00:16.970> we<00:00:17.840> started<00:00:18.259> with<00:00:18.470> twenty<00:00:19.099> stitches

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
amount we started with twenty stitches

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.939 
amount we started with twenty stitches
so<00:00:19.880> 1<00:00:19.910> 2<00:00:20.570> 3<00:00:20.600> 4<00:00:21.020> 5<00:00:21.710> 6<00:00:22.100> on<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:22.699> needle<00:00:23.439> we<00:00:24.439> need<00:00:24.619> 4

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 on this needle we need 4

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:35.799 
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 on this needle we need 4
more<00:00:26.560> 7<00:00:27.760> 8<00:00:29.710> 9<00:00:31.239> 10<00:00:32.890> so<00:00:33.890> these<00:00:34.129> other<00:00:34.370> ones<00:00:34.809> will

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
more 7 8 9 10 so these other ones will

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.610 
more 7 8 9 10 so these other ones will
go<00:00:36.020> on<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:38.059> back<00:00:38.210> needle<00:00:38.510> which<00:00:39.290> is<00:00:39.440> down

once again here's how I finished mine I
made<00:02:20.959> an<00:02:21.080> i-cord<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.430> make<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:22.940> long

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
made an i-cord you can make that as long

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.640 
made an i-cord you can make that as long
as<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.450> want<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.989> don't<00:02:24.110> know<00:02:24.290> how<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.470> do
