00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
it kind of makes like a scale pattern

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.139 
it kind of makes like a scale pattern
like<00:00:44.379> a<00:00:44.409> dragon<00:00:45.070> scales<00:00:45.429> or<00:00:45.760> something<00:00:46.059> like

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:30.090 

it's<00:00:53.200> kind<00:00:53.410> of<00:00:53.500> any<00:00:53.650> little<00:00:54.100> thing

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240 

hey<00:01:31.119> got<00:01:32.119> trucks<00:01:32.479> in<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.750> background<00:01:33.260> they're

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
hey got trucks in the background they're

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.800 
hey got trucks in the background they're
building<00:01:34.580> some<00:01:34.760> houses<00:01:35.150> on<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.420> other<00:01:35.570> side

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810

pouring<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.119> pads<00:01:41.330> today<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.190> we've<00:01:43.190> got<00:01:43.369> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
pouring the pads today so we've got the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.510 
pouring the pads today so we've got the
trucks<00:01:43.820> of

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
trucks of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.620

cement trucks in the neighborhood

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.350 
cement trucks in the neighborhood
they<00:01:49.049> keep<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.860> circles

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:11.120
