00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.620
 Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight, featuring, Ziggs, the Hexplosives Expert. 

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:20.684
 Ziggs is a ranged wizard, adept at long range bombing, area damage, and battlefield control. 

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:27.360
 His passive is Short Fuse. In a few seconds, your next basic attack will deal extra damage. 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.566
 Short Fuse appears faster every time Ziggs uses his skills. 

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:38.207
 Bouncing Bomb launches a bomb that explodes if it lands on an enemy, taking damage from nearby enemies. 

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:46.247
 However, if the bomb does not fall on an enemy, instead it clears, exploding when hitting an enemy or its third quique. 

00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:49.993
 Note that the throw distance determines the speed of the pump. 

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:55.952
 As its main source of damage, Pego Bouncing Bomb at level 1 and maximize at level 9. 

00:00:55.952 --> 00:01:02.984
 Satchel Charge casts an explosive charge on the ground that explodes after a short time or when Ziggs reactivates the ability. 

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:07.603
 When Satchel Charge explodes, it takes damage and pushes all nearby enemies back. 

00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:12.080
 Ziggs can use Satchel Charge to launch away without receiving damage. 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.317
 Since it's a utility spell, take a Satchel Charge point at level 4 and maximize last. 

00:01:17.317 --> 00:01:23.370
 Hexplosive Minefield spreads a number of mines in an area, each exploding on the enemy that walk on them. 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:32.178
 Enemies hit by a mine receive damage and slow for a short time. Enemies that activate multiple mines receive reduced damage after the first one. 

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:37.485
 As you have strong area damage, get Hexplosives Minefield early and maximize at level 13. 

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:45.630
 Its ultimate is Mega Inferno Bomb, in which an area explodes on the map, causing a lot of damage on all the enemies that are in that region. 

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:51.200
 Mega Inferno Bomb has an incredible range and shows a warning to enemies before they fall. 

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:56.170
 Like all ultimatums, get Mega Inferno Bomb at levels 6, 11, and 16. 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.440
 When on the lane, try bouncing Bouncing Bomb with Short Fuse to hinder your opponent. 

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:06.930
 As Gragas approaches, I can tear up much of his life with a quick combo, giving me control of the lane. 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.060
 As soon as you learn Hexplosive Minefield, you can do even more. Causes damage to Gragas until he gets low. 

00:02:13.063 --> 00:02:18.300
 I play Hexplosives Minefield behind him, giving him no chance to escape, and giving me the first blood. 

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:22.610
 With enough power ability you can knock down enemy champions alone with full life. 

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:28.690
 When Gragas close to Hexplosive Minefield, Bouncing Bomb and Short Fuse causes significant amounts of damage. 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:35.200
 As he runs, Satchel Charge pushes him to me. I end up with him with Mega Inferno Bomb, to make sure he was not going to survive. 

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:40.000
 When he tries to come back, I hit a Short Fuse. If he ran, Bouncing Bomb would kill. 

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:43.570
 As a magician, you must get extra mana with the Ancient Golem buff. 

00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:49.050
 The easiest way to do this is to jump through the wall with Satchel Charge, then hit a Short Fuse and Bouncing Bomb. 

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:56.880
 Defeat Hexplosive Minefield only after the small monsters are dead. Take the golem to the mines and finish with Bouncing Bomb if necessary. 

00:02:56.883 --> 00:03:02.990
 If used properly, Satchel Charge is an excellent escape tool. Here I am surprised by Gangplank and Gragas. 

00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:10.390
 I know I need to escape to my tower, so I put a Satchel Charge in front of Gragas, use Flash on top of it, and burst for my safety. 

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:14.750
 Gragas almost caught me with Explosive Cask, but Shen saves me with Stand United. 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.220
 Use Mega Inferno Bomb to help your comrades, but hold it until your enemies are in control. 

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:24.750
 I see Shen going to the Malphite. As soon as he uses Shadow Dash, I play the Mega Inferno Bomb. 

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:29.230
 It causes so much damage that until the Malphite tries to run, Shen takes to kill with Vorpal Blade. 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.260
 Teamfights with Ziggs requires a lot of tactics. Perceiving two close enemies, start with Mega Inferno Bomb for great damage, then Bouncing Bomb and Short Fuse. 

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:41.630
 As a result, we get Malphite and Gangplank runs. 

00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:48.460
 When they regroup, I brake their main entrance with Hexplosives Minefield and run as I see Gragas cross the wall. 

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:53.460
 Start at Gangplank and try to run through the spells, finally escaping through the wall with Satchel Charge. 

00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:58.600
 Thanks to Ziggs' tricks, I almost do not go out alive and I still take two kills for my team. 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.320
 In Dominion, make use of Ziggs' long range. When I pick up the Windmill at the beginning of the game, I'm behind and play my skills on the enemy team. 

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:10.390
 Stop your catches constantly and try to catch the spot yourself. 

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:13.830
 Every time the enemies group together, play some more skills. 

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:17.950
 Once you get the point, look for weak enemies to see if you can catch some kill. 

00:04:17.948 --> 00:04:23.360
 I try to follow Karthus, finally killing him with Flash, Ignite, and a Bouncing Bomb from afar. 

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:27.970
 Meanwhile, we've weakened Lux ​​enough for Ezreal to win the second kill. 

00:04:27.972 --> 00:04:31.250
 Ziggs is exceptional when capturing points for the same reason. 

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:38.800
 Attacking the Windmill once more, Coloco Hexplosive Minefield in the center of the point, taking out heavy damage from Karthus and limiting his mobility. 

00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:45.630
 I turn around at the point, hit Short Fuse and Bouncing Bomb to catch the kill, allowing us to capture the point as soon as your passive ends. 

00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:53.760
 For runes, I suggest Magic Penetration Marks, Ability Power per level Seals, Ability Power per level Glyphs, and Quintessences of Fixed Ability Power. 

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:57.460
 This build is geared to extra damage on all Ziggs abilities. 

00:04:57.457 --> 00:05:07.070
 For Masteries, try 21/0/9, picking up all ability ability and increase Magic Offense damage, plus mana regeneration and Neutral buff duration in Utility. 

00:05:07.068 --> 00:05:14.420
 From summoner spells, Ignite and Flash will help cause even more damage and give certainty for kills or escape from tight situations. 

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:20.200
 In Classic, start with Doran's Ring and maybe add a few more to cover the need for mana regeneration. 

00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:30.060
 Sorcerer's Shoes and Rabbadon's Deathcap will do you more damage. Put other valuable items in your build, such as Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Void Staff, Will of the Ancients, and Zhonya's Hourglass. 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.860
 In Dominion, its build is similar. Start with Prospector's Ring, Boots of Speed, and two Health Potions. 

00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:39.720
 Sorcerer's Shoes and Rabbadon's Deathcap are still great items of damage. 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 You'll need cooldown reduction, so get Morello's Evil Tome before investing in Void Staff, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, and Will of the Ancients. 

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:56.470
