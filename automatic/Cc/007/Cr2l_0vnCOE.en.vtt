the weather and the handling and the
like<00:02:05.109> and<00:02:05.889> the<00:02:06.429> circuit<00:02:06.939> layout<00:02:07.659> right<00:02:08.229> which

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
like and the circuit layout right which

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.580 
like and the circuit layout right which
they<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:09.009> got<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:10.210> is<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.869> bodes<00:02:11.230> very

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
they have got this is this bodes very

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.340 
they have got this is this bodes very
well<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.489> fence

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
well for a fence

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.480 
well for a fence
you<00:02:14.350> have<00:02:14.470> actually<00:02:14.770> certain<00:02:15.070> previous

you have actually certain previous
videos<00:02:15.910> how<00:02:16.270> proud<00:02:16.630> codemasters<00:02:17.560> were<00:02:17.770> of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
videos how proud codemasters were of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.680 
videos how proud codemasters were of
their<00:02:18.340> handling<00:02:18.850> also<00:02:19.270> their<00:02:19.450> weather

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the circuit it's different depending on

hood<00:02:50.740> was<00:02:50.980> saying<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.490> video<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:52.120> know

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
hood was saying in the video you know

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.560 
hood was saying in the video you know
that<00:02:53.280> he<00:02:54.280> would<00:02:54.400> rather<00:02:54.640> play<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> game<00:02:55.360> like

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
that he would rather play a game like

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.200 
that he would rather play a game like
that<00:02:55.870> where<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.740> have<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> full<00:02:57.910> syn

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
that where you can have a full syn

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.840 
that where you can have a full syn
experience<00:02:58.810> rather<00:02:59.080> than<00:02:59.320> just<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.700> know

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
experience rather than just you know

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.550 
experience rather than just you know
going<00:03:01.210> backwards<00:03:01.780> or<00:03:01.990> doing<00:03:02.230> some<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.530> that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
going backwards or doing some of that

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.900 
going backwards or doing some of that
where<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.860> can<00:03:02.980> actually<00:03:03.100> opinion<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.760> can

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
where you can actually opinion you can

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.760 
where you can actually opinion you can
race<00:03:04.090> Monica<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.720> dry<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.960> can<00:03:05.170> make<00:03:05.470> rest

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
race Monica on the dry you can make rest

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.520

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.780 
series of six yep and we're halfway
there<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.470> when<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.950> think<00:03:45.130> about<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.490> guys

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
there and when you think about it guys

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.990 
there and when you think about it guys
is<00:03:46.240> only<00:03:46.510> three<00:03:47.410> or<00:03:47.560> three<00:03:48.130> or<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.459> months<00:03:48.490> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
is only three or three or so months to
