these a zombie Chow will start spawning
panda<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.190> eating<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
panda you don't want to be eating that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.990 
panda you don't want to be eating that
you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.180> probably<00:00:39.420> burn<00:00:39.899> him<00:00:40.079> through<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
you can probably burn him through that

pretty<00:00:42.000> easily<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.719> uh<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.890> makes<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
pretty easily but uh this just makes it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.330 
pretty easily but uh this just makes it
more<00:00:44.340> simplistic<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.570> seven<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.469> burn<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
more simplistic on seven to out burn the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
more simplistic on seven to out burn the
heal<00:00:47.730> he<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.270> doesn't<00:00:48.539> heal<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
heal he just doesn't heal at all in the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.150 
heal he just doesn't heal at all in the
age<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> dice<00:00:51.260> one<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> key<00:00:52.590> things<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
age of dice one of the key things you to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.830 
age of dice one of the key things you to
make<00:00:53.280> sure<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> keep

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
platform um I actually kind of this is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.999 
platform um I actually kind of this is
actually<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.320> time<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> ever<00:01:43.740> even

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
actually the first time I ever even

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
tried just do this solo I just record it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.830 
tried just do this solo I just record it
for<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> walls<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> know<00:01:48.600> I'm

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
for the walls and it's like you know I'm

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
for the walls and it's like you know I'm
not<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.350> despite<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> again<00:01:50.070> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
not going to do this despite it again so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.880 
not going to do this despite it again so
I'm<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.759> uses<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> tutorial<00:01:52.170> yura

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I'm just uses for the tutorial yura

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
I'm just uses for the tutorial yura
poland<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.700> same<00:01:53.850> platform<00:01:54.060> because

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
poland with the same platform because

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.460 
poland with the same platform because
you<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> kill<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> same<00:01:55.409> time

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you have to kill it at the same time

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
you have to kill it at the same time
it's<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.009> easier<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.490> they're<00:01:56.640> together<00:01:56.820> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it's just easier if they're together so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's just easier if they're together so
you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.869> them<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.040> kill<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
you can see them so just kill one and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
you can see them so just kill one and
then<00:01:59.700> kill<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> other<00:02:00.320> you'll<00:02:01.320> take<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> lot<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
then kill the other you'll take a lot of

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.929 
then kill the other you'll take a lot of
lightning<00:02:02.009> damage<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
lightning damage just because of the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.880 
lightning damage just because of the
mechanic<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.420> fight<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.469> there's<00:02:04.649> no<00:02:04.710> way

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
mechanic of the fight and there's no way

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.999 
mechanic of the fight and there's no way
to<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.189> mitigate<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:07.799> constantly

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to really mitigate that just constantly

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.880
