00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510 

when<00:00:00.570> planting<00:00:01.050> asparagus<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:02.040> want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.370> have

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
when planting asparagus you want to have

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.130 
when planting asparagus you want to have
a<00:00:02.550> very<00:00:02.850> sandy<00:00:03.270> loom<00:00:04.040> for<00:00:05.040> your<00:00:05.310> soil<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.140> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
a very sandy loom for your soil and the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.870 
a very sandy loom for your soil and the
reason<00:00:07.440> why<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:08.130> doesn't<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.610> very<00:00:08.760> well

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
reason why is it doesn't do very well

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.749 
reason why is it doesn't do very well
with<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.389> lot<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.870> heavy<00:00:10.860> soil<00:00:11.250> because<00:00:11.610> it

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
with a lot of heavy soil because it

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.730 
with a lot of heavy soil because it
causes<00:00:12.170> crown<00:00:13.170> rot<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.920> root<00:00:14.880> rot<00:00:15.680> now<00:00:16.680> I

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
causes crown rot and root rot now I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040 
causes crown rot and root rot now I
planted<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.279> asparagus<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.510> furrows

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
planted my asparagus and these furrows

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.880 
planted my asparagus and these furrows
and<00:00:19.320> they're<00:00:19.920> high<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.199> then<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.769> an

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and they're high up and then I have an

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.320 
and they're high up and then I have an
area<00:00:23.220> down<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.850> drops<00:00:24.210> off<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:26.330> don't

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
area down here that drops off so I don't

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.349 
area down here that drops off so I don't
have<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> lot<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.900> water<00:00:28.230> inside<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:29.939> plant

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
have a lot of water inside of my plant

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
have a lot of water inside of my plant
to<00:00:30.810> cause<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.410> rot<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.489> raining<00:00:32.730> right

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to cause the rot and it's raining right

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.920 
to cause the rot and it's raining right
now<00:00:33.950> one<00:00:34.950> thing<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.399> asparagus<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.690> allows

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
now one thing about asparagus it allows

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.750 
now one thing about asparagus it allows
phosphorus<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.010> needs<00:00:38.219> nitrogen<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.649> the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
phosphorus and it needs nitrogen and the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.790 
phosphorus and it needs nitrogen and the
deeper<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.180> plant<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.899> asparagus<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
deeper you plant the asparagus the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.029 
deeper you plant the asparagus the
thicker<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.489> stock<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.140> shallower<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
thicker the stock and the shallower you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
thicker the stock and the shallower you
plat<00:00:47.309> asparagus<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.180> comes<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.140> thin<00:00:49.530> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
plat asparagus it comes out so thin that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.490 
plat asparagus it comes out so thin that
you<00:00:49.890> can't<00:00:50.190> even<00:00:51.000> sell<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> commercially<00:00:52.379> if

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you can't even sell it commercially if

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
you can't even sell it commercially if
you're<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:52.980> commercial<00:00:53.370> grower<00:00:54.620> so

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you're going to do commercial grower so

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
you're going to do commercial grower so
what<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:57.000> ahead<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
what I'm going to do is go ahead and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.010 
what I'm going to do is go ahead and
harvest<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:59.059> cook<00:01:00.059> them<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.420> want

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
harvest these and then cook them up want

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070 
harvest these and then cook them up want
to<00:01:01.109> plot<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.320> asparagus<00:01:02.120> crowns<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to plot your asparagus crowns with the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.580 
to plot your asparagus crowns with the
buds<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:05.549> six<00:01:06.000> inches<00:01:06.390> under<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> soil

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
buds up about six inches under the soil

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
buds up about six inches under the soil
so<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.100> six<00:01:08.310> inches<00:01:08.460> under<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> soil

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so it's about six inches under the soil

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640 
so it's about six inches under the soil
and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.170> sure<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.439> add

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and then you want to make sure you add

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.539 
and then you want to make sure you add
lime<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:12.420> add<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> lime<00:01:13.020> about<00:01:13.619> between

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
lime and you add the lime about between

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.710 
lime and you add the lime about between
ten<00:01:15.360> inches<00:01:16.070> under<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> top<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> soil<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
ten inches under the top of the soil so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
ten inches under the top of the soil so
that<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.470> roots<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> sweetened

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that the roots will have a sweetened

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
that the roots will have a sweetened
lime<00:01:21.390> soil<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> stand<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.340> ph

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
lime soil for the stand get your ph

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.920 
lime soil for the stand get your ph
meter<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.180> asparagus<00:01:25.110> likes<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> soil<00:01:25.830> between

roughly about two inches high and you're

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
roughly about two inches high and you're
going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.899> lay<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.649> crown<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.610> asparagus

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
going to lay your crown of asparagus

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.810 
going to lay your crown of asparagus
over<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.290> top<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.369> asparagus

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
over the top of here and your asparagus

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.450 
over the top of here and your asparagus
has<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:51.990> look<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> spider<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
has like all look like a spider and it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
has like all look like a spider and it
flares<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.390> that'll<00:01:54.840> sit<00:01:55.079> completely<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.680> top

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
flares out that'll sit completely on top

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
flares out that'll sit completely on top
of<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.479> well<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
of this well and then you're going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.679 
of this well and then you're going to
cover<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.280> few<00:01:59.520> inches<00:01:59.579> with<00:02:00.540> some

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
cover it up just a few inches with some

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.399 
cover it up just a few inches with some
soil<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:02.009> when<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> rains<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.750> rain<00:02:03.960> actually

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
soil but when it rains the rain actually

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.069 
soil but when it rains the rain actually
starts<00:02:04.740> filling<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.969> area<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> dirt

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
starts filling in the area as the dirt

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.919 
starts filling in the area as the dirt
drops<00:02:07.380> off<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> side<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.539> eventually<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.780> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
drops off the side and eventually as you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.650 
drops off the side and eventually as you
water<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.550> area<00:02:11.550> fills<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.480> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
water your area fills up like it is in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.040 
water your area fills up like it is in
my

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
my

my
right<00:02:13.350> now<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.850> illustration<00:02:15.420> right

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
right now in this illustration right

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.200 
right now in this illustration right
here<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.440> easily<00:02:16.650> how<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
here you can see easily how we have the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.690 
here you can see easily how we have the
crown<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.960> dirt<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.770> here<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.070> then

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
crown of the dirt going here and then

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.330 
crown of the dirt going here and then
the<00:02:21.300> crown<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.960> asparagus<00:02:22.590> sits<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.160> top

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the crown of the asparagus sits on top

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.420 
the crown of the asparagus sits on top
of<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.790> crown<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.560> then<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.980> go<00:02:26.130> ahead<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
of this crown and then you go ahead and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300 
of this crown and then you go ahead and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
put some dirt on top and then eventually

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.910 
put some dirt on top and then eventually
the<00:02:29.850> rain<00:02:30.090> fills<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.110> dirtiest<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.650> falls

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the rain fills in the dirtiest it falls

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.710 
the rain fills in the dirtiest it falls
down<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.520> cascades<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.120> top<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> existing

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.500 
down and cascades on top of the existing
asparagus<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.730> matter<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.030> weeks<00:02:36.120> its

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
asparagus and in a matter of weeks its

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.320 
asparagus and in a matter of weeks its
killed<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.050> also<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> therapist<00:02:38.700> goes<00:02:38.910> wild

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
killed in also a therapist goes wild

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.940 
killed in also a therapist goes wild
