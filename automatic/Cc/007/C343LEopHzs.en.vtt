00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.470
 truce residents of Donetsk finally

 that this war will last at least 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.750

 particular prisoner exchange each of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 the opposing sides seized in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 captured more than a thousand fighters

 Ukraine Peter Poroshenko believes 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.560
 the signed document is just the first step to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.560
 full truce and a fish 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.650
 we are ready to take important steps 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.990
 including decentralization of power 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.750
 decentralization of lugansk and donetsk

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 residents will be guaranteed 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:32.130
 use whatever language they are

 fulfillment of political demands 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.920
 the fact that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.200
 course to disconnect in some way 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.270
 finished no this measure is forced in order 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.820
 so that a single people stopped pouring 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.460
 blood status of the region for which were conducted 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.680

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.009
 accept armistice terms
