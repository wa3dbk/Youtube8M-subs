most<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:06.110> if<00:01:07.110> there's<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
most of the work if there's one of the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.830 
most of the work if there's one of the

ships that has been damaged more than
the<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.070> right

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the other as you can see this one right

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.280 
the other as you can see this one right
here<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:12.000> ahead<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.270> let<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> fort<00:01:12.810> continue

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
here go ahead and let the fort continue

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
here go ahead and let the fort continue
working<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.070> take<00:01:14.340> care<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> other

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
working on it and take care of the other
ships<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> fort's<00:01:15.900> attentions<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.860> be

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
ships so the fort's attentions will be

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
ships so the fort's attentions will be
focused<00:01:17.310> exclusively<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> ship<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
focused exclusively on the ship that you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.710 
focused exclusively on the ship that you
wanted<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> destroy<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.450> I'm

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
wanted to destroy so you can see I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.719 
wanted to destroy so you can see I'm
going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.320> focus<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> brick<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> has

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
going to focus on that brick that has

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
going to focus on that brick that has
not<00:01:24.000> yet<00:01:24.180> been<00:01:24.330> attacked<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> fort<00:01:25.770> can

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
not yet been attacked so the fort can

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
not yet been attacked so the fort can
work<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> isn't<00:01:26.729> already

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
work on the one that isn't already

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:52.840 
work on the one that isn't already
nearly<00:01:27.330> destroyed

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.830 

at<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:53.970> point<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.300> had<00:01:54.390> wandered<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.810> little

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
at this point I had wandered a little

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.710 
at this point I had wandered a little
bit<00:01:55.170> far<00:01:55.380> from<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.610> fort<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.210> had<00:01:57.450> allowed

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
bit far from the fort which had allowed

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.330 
bit far from the fort which had allowed
this<00:01:57.960> ship<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.440> escape<00:01:58.740> some<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> damage

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this ship to escape some of the damage

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.180 
this ship to escape some of the damage
from<00:01:59.370> it<00:01:59.780> what<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> needed<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.830> to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
from it what I needed to do was to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.969 
from it what I needed to do was to
approach<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.910> fort<00:02:03.150> again<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.860> would

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
approach the fort again so that it would

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
approach the fort again so that it would
do<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.640> work<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.030> me<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.300> could<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.570> the
