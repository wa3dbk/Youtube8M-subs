having the the fight for Mayweather as

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
having the the fight for Mayweather as
well<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.200> close<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.890> could<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> see

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
well a very close one I could you see

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
well a very close one I could you see
you<00:00:39.120> even<00:00:39.390> having<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> draw<00:00:40.079> there's<00:00:40.950> no<00:00:41.129> way

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you even having a draw there's no way

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.990 
you even having a draw there's no way
one<00:00:41.610> person<00:00:42.230> convincingly<00:00:43.230> won<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.739> fight<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
one person convincingly won this fight I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
one person convincingly won this fight I
think<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.719> George<00:00:45.960> had<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> won<00:00:46.590> 8-1<00:00:46.739> 18-1

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
think one George had it won 8-1 18-1

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.080 
think one George had it won 8-1 18-1
something<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.760> don't<00:00:50.760> agree<00:00:51.000> with

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
something that one I don't agree with

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.680 
something that one I don't agree with
that<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> was<00:00:51.750> BS<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:53.039> 117<00:00:53.910> won<00:00:54.270> 13-1

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that one that was BS the 117 won 13-1

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.010 
that one that was BS the 117 won 13-1
maybe<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.699> I<00:00:56.699> agree<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.570> bit<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.899> with

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
maybe I I agree a little bit more with

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
maybe I I agree a little bit more with
that<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.469> still<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> little

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
that one but still that was a little

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.900 
that one but still that was a little
wide<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.329> taste<00:01:00.570> maybe<00:01:00.780> 116<00:01:01.469> 114<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.640> at

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
wide for my taste maybe 116 114 but at

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.979 
wide for my taste maybe 116 114 but at
the<00:01:03.000> end<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> day<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> very<00:01:03.840> close

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the end of the day was a very close

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
the end of the day was a very close
fight<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.949> thought<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:06.060> half<00:01:06.270> half<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
fight I thought basically half half the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
fight I thought basically half half the
fight<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.530> close<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
fight was so close there were a lot of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
fight was so close there were a lot of
close<00:01:09.840> rounds<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> had<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.250> six

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
close rounds have like I had like six

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.149 
close rounds have like I had like six
rounds<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.659> were<00:01:12.720> close<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.350> i<00:01:13.560> could<00:01:14.010> see

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
rounds that were close that i could see

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
rounds that were close that i could see
you<00:01:14.250> giving<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.360> either<00:01:15.479> way<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.900> has

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you giving it going either way this has

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
you giving it going either way this has
decided<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> split<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.220> split<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.150> at

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
decided to split them split them at

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
decided to split them split them at
three<00:01:18.600> rounds<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.320> diner<00:01:19.530> three<00:01:19.830> runs<00:01:19.979> to

close fight man there are a lot of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.020 
close fight man there are a lot of
rounds<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.590> were<00:01:43.649> hard<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> score<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.520> at

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
rounds that were hard to score but at

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.330 
rounds that were hard to score but at
the<00:01:45.210> end<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> day<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:45.810> Maidana<00:01:46.680> did

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the end of the day I think Maidana did

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940 
the end of the day I think Maidana did
did<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> little<00:01:48.390> bit<00:01:48.509> more<00:01:48.720> than<00:01:48.990> Floyd<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
did a little bit more than Floyd and I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.230 
did a little bit more than Floyd and I
think<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.250> dad<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> should<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.850> gotten<00:01:51.060> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
think my dad I should have gotten this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.370 
think my dad I should have gotten this
is<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.780> decision<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.450> I'm

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
is the decision but it is what it is I'm

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
is the decision but it is what it is I'm
not<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.680> pissed<00:01:55.950> off<00:01:56.100> about<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.549> decision

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
not really pissed off about the decision

videos<00:04:08.050> talking<00:04:08.410> about<00:04:08.739> what<00:04:09.190> what<00:04:09.790> did<00:04:09.880> I

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
videos talking about what what did I

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.640 
videos talking about what what did I
think<00:04:10.150> about<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.420> fight<00:04:10.630> more<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> future

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
think about the fight more in the future

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.729 
think about the fight more in the future
but<00:04:12.549> that's<00:04:12.820> right<00:04:13.060> now<00:04:13.239> really<00:04:14.140> close<00:04:14.410> fight

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
but that's right now really close fight

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.370 
but that's right now really close fight
I<00:04:15.330> thought<00:04:16.330> Maidana<00:04:16.690> one<00:04:16.900> up<00:04:17.019> very<00:04:17.260> close

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
I thought Maidana one up very close

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.259 
I thought Maidana one up very close
fight<00:04:17.739> seven<00:04:18.100> rounds<00:04:18.310> 25<00:04:18.459> but<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.030> guess<00:04:19.150> I

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
fight seven rounds 25 but I guess I

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.000 
fight seven rounds 25 but I guess I
could<00:04:19.419> have<00:04:19.540> gone<00:04:19.630> either<00:04:19.690> way<00:04:19.900> depending<00:04:20.650> on

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
could have gone either way depending on

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.010 
could have gone either way depending on
who<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.220> favor<00:04:21.400> more<00:04:21.760> depending<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.300> who<00:04:22.810> you

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
who you favor more depending on who you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.409
