00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the same position with black to move and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
the same position with black to move and
this<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.469> how<00:00:34.680> he<00:00:34.739> does<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
a1 check King to b8 twin to a5 and we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.549 
a1 check King to b8 twin to a5 and we
have<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> same<00:00:44.370> position<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.539> black<00:00:46.110> to

I<00:00:47.149> guess<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.690> black<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
I guess so what can black do here is one

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
I guess so what can black do here is one
