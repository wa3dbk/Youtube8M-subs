00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.300 
install this thing well alright so the
clip<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.280> actually<00:04:05.060> too<00:04:05.299> shallow<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:06.140> go<00:04:07.099> where

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
clip is actually too shallow to go where

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.069 
clip is actually too shallow to go where
I<00:04:07.340> want<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.879> go<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.510> I'm<00:04:08.660> going<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.810> clip<00:04:08.989> it

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
I want it to go so I'm going to clip it

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.289 
I want it to go so I'm going to clip it
to<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.260> glass<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:10.310> tempered<00:04:10.730> glass<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.239> it

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
to the glass it's tempered glass so it

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.860 
to the glass it's tempered glass so it
should<00:04:11.480> hold<00:04:11.660> up<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:12.049> fine<00:04:13.630> but<00:04:14.630> I'm

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
should hold up just fine but I'm

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.870 
should hold up just fine but I'm
actually<00:04:15.079> going<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.609> stick<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.639> piece<00:04:16.820> of

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
actually going to stick a piece of

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.870 
actually going to stick a piece of
cardboard<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.220> like<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:21.490> so<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.520> way<00:04:22.760> it

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
cardboard in it like this so that way it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.969 
cardboard in it like this so that way it
doesn't<00:04:23.120> scratch<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.510> glass<00:04:23.630> there's<00:04:24.590> also<00:04:24.830> a

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
doesn't scratch the glass there's also a

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.529 
doesn't scratch the glass there's also a
rubber<00:04:25.250> pad<00:04:25.490> installed<00:04:25.940> on<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.120> top<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.450> the

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
rubber pad installed on the top of the

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.940 
rubber pad installed on the top of the
pad<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.990> don't<00:04:27.139> have<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.380> worry<00:04:27.590> about<00:04:27.710> it

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
pad so I don't have to worry about it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.520 
pad so I don't have to worry about it
scratching<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.400> top<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.820> desk<00:04:28.970> either

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:43.140 

righty-tighty<00:04:33.530> lefty-loosey

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.670 

all<00:04:44.150> right<00:04:44.419> that<00:04:44.630> should<00:04:44.750> actually<00:04:44.900> be<00:04:45.139> tight

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
all right that should actually be tight

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.680 
all right that should actually be tight
enough<00:04:45.940> all<00:04:46.940> right<00:04:47.060> well<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> don't<00:04:47.480> know<00:04:47.600> if

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
enough all right well I don't know if

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.300 
enough all right well I don't know if
this<00:04:47.810> product<00:04:48.169> comes<00:04:48.350> pretty<00:04:48.740> bent<00:04:48.980> or<00:04:49.160> what

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
this product comes pretty bent or what

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.890 
this product comes pretty bent or what
the<00:04:49.430> deal<00:04:49.610> is<00:04:49.669> but<00:04:50.270> if<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.510> look<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:53.570> kind<00:04:53.780> of

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
the deal is but if you look it kind of

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.909 
the deal is but if you look it kind of
bends<00:04:54.169> inwards<00:04:54.770> right<00:04:55.669> here<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.240> these<00:04:57.110> were

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
bends inwards right here and these were

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.450 
bends inwards right here and these were
actually<00:04:58.250> bent<00:04:58.490> out<00:04:59.530> so<00:05:00.530> what<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.680> had<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.950> do<00:05:01.130> is

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
actually bent out so what I had to do is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.670 
actually bent out so what I had to do is
I<00:05:02.300> had<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.540> physically<00:05:03.490> bend<00:05:04.490> everything<00:05:05.680> so

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
I had to physically bend everything so

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.550 
I had to physically bend everything so
that<00:05:06.950> this<00:05:07.100> part<00:05:07.430> would<00:05:07.550> clear<00:05:08.120> otherwise<00:05:08.990> the

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
that this part would clear otherwise the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.810 
that this part would clear otherwise the
boom<00:05:09.770> would<00:05:09.980> have<00:05:10.070> never<00:05:10.250> gotten<00:05:10.490> anywhere

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
boom would have never gotten anywhere

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.040 
boom would have never gotten anywhere
near<00:05:11.120> my<00:05:11.270> face<00:05:11.450> not<00:05:12.410> actually<00:05:12.830> installing<00:05:13.160> it

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
near my face not actually installing it

that before I started recording this
part<00:06:00.229> of<00:06:00.289> the<00:06:00.350> project<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:01.070> removed<00:06:01.850> my

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
part of the project I removed my

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.670 
part of the project I removed my
microphone<00:06:02.510> from<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:02.720> stand<00:06:04.720> and<00:06:05.720> proceeded

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
microphone from the stand and proceeded

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.629 
microphone from the stand and proceeded
to<00:06:07.330> hook<00:06:08.330> it<00:06:08.479> in<00:06:08.630> to<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.710> standard<00:06:10.310> threads

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
to hook it in to the standard threads

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.670 
to hook it in to the standard threads
for<00:06:11.180> any<00:06:11.419> sized<00:06:11.690> microphone

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.899 

after<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.710> finished<00:06:16.069> that<00:06:16.189> I<00:06:16.340> started<00:06:16.789> routing

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
after I finished that I started routing

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.429 
after I finished that I started routing
the<00:06:17.120> cable<00:06:17.419> from<00:06:17.509> the<00:06:17.599> microphone<00:06:18.050> back<00:06:18.229> so

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
the cable from the microphone back so

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.689 
the cable from the microphone back so
though<00:06:18.530> how<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.740> extra<00:06:19.099> cable<00:06:19.430> could<00:06:19.550> hide

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
though how the extra cable could hide

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.959 
though how the extra cable could hide
underneath<00:06:20.060> my<00:06:20.240> desk<00:06:21.310> well<00:06:22.310> due<00:06:22.550> to<00:06:22.580> technical
