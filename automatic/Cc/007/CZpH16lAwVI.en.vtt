it's<00:00:34.570> pretty<00:00:34.870> cool<00:00:35.110> I<00:00:35.170> reckon<00:00:35.620> it's<00:00:36.579> basically

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
it's pretty cool I reckon it's basically

a<00:00:37.510> Fender<00:00:37.870> hotrod<00:00:38.140> Deville<00:00:38.530> but<00:00:38.770> we've<00:00:39.250> had<00:00:39.340> a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
a Fender hotrod Deville but we've had a

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.180 
a Fender hotrod Deville but we've had a
few<00:00:39.579> changes<00:00:39.880> so<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.719> major<00:00:40.899> change<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.680> the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
few changes so the major change is the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.950 
few changes so the major change is the
drive<00:00:42.460> channel<00:00:42.880> has<00:00:43.120> been<00:00:43.329> given<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.719> flick

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750
