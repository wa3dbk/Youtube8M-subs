double rib or box stitch that I did in
my<00:00:15.900> other<00:00:16.350> video<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:19.340> you're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> start

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
my other video and you're going to start

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.920 
my other video and you're going to start
with<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.750> yarn<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:23.390> you're<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> do

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
with your yarn and you're going to do

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.640 
with your yarn and you're going to do
the<00:00:25.140> opposite<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.090> did<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.650> your

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the opposite of what you did on your

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.720 
the opposite of what you did on your
previous<00:00:29.900> box<00:00:30.900> stitch<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.099> instead<00:00:32.579> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
previous box stitch so instead of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.620 
previous box stitch so instead of
continuing<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:34.440> across<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.630> peg

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
continuing and going across to this peg

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750 
continuing and going across to this peg
I'm<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.469> across<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.129> two<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
I'm going to go across to the two the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.990 
I'm going to go across to the two the
one<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.300> directly<00:00:39.600> across<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
one right directly across from it and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.500 
one right directly across from it and
then<00:00:42.000> wrap<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.200> next<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.510> across

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
then wrap the one next to it and across

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
then wrap the one next to it and across
and<00:00:47.210> wrap<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:50.340> I'm

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and wrap and you can see that I'm

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610 
and wrap and you can see that I'm
wrapping<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> ones<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> here

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
wrapping the ones like this one here

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
wrapping the ones like this one here
that<00:00:52.739> does<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.340> yarn<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.910> between<00:00:54.539> this

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
that does not have yarn in between this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.639 
that does not have yarn in between this
one<00:00:54.899> does<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:58.410> one

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
one does so I don't want to do this one

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.100 
one does so I don't want to do this one
I'm<00:00:58.859> wrapping<00:00:59.219> where<00:00:59.430> there's<00:00:59.820> no<00:01:00.210> yarn<00:01:03.110> so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
I'm wrapping where there's no yarn so

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.190 
I'm wrapping where there's no yarn so
you<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.350> continue<00:01:04.710> wrapping<00:01:05.659> all<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.110> way

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you just continue wrapping all the way

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
you just continue wrapping all the way
across<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.170> across<00:01:10.560> around<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> one

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
across you go across around to the one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.679 
across you go across around to the one
right<00:01:12.570> next<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:14.189> straight<00:01:15.030> across<00:01:15.150> on

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
right next to it then straight across on

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.399 
right next to it then straight across on
the<00:01:16.500> other<00:01:16.530> side<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.650> wrap

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:32.609 

all<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.399> way<00:01:24.520> down<00:01:29.819> I<00:01:31.140> lost<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.259> piece<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.560> my

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
all the way down I lost a piece of my

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.609 
all the way down I lost a piece of my
yarn<00:01:32.829> there<00:01:33.569> it's<00:01:34.569> a<00:01:34.630> little<00:01:34.840> bit<00:01:34.990> more

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
yarn there it's a little bit more

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.260 
yarn there it's a little bit more
difficult<00:01:36.130> sometimes<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.640> do<00:01:36.819> it<00:01:36.880> with<00:01:37.000> two

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
difficult sometimes to do it with two

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.990 
difficult sometimes to do it with two
strands<00:01:38.049> of<00:01:38.170> yarn<00:01:38.319> but<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.679> I<00:01:38.979> prefer<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.789> do<00:01:39.909> it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
strands of yarn but I I prefer to do it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.399 
strands of yarn but I I prefer to do it
that<00:01:40.149> way<00:01:40.240> cuz<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.509> makes<00:01:40.539> it<00:01:40.929> much<00:01:41.079> thicker

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
that way cuz it makes it much thicker

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.679 
that way cuz it makes it much thicker
and<00:01:42.539> more<00:01:43.539> cuddly<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.560> now<00:01:47.770> you're<00:01:48.099> going<00:01:48.280> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and more cuddly so now you're going to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.440 
and more cuddly so now you're going to
see<00:01:49.689> when<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.530> look<00:01:50.709> down<00:01:51.179> you're<00:01:52.179> going<00:01:52.329> to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
see when you look down you're going to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.300 
see when you look down you're going to
see<00:01:52.719> here's<00:01:53.049> where<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.409> did<00:01:53.619> your<00:01:53.649> double<00:01:54.130> rib

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
see here's where you did your double rib

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.179 
see here's where you did your double rib
stitch<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.810> Bach<00:01:56.079> stitch<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.679> then<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.009> is

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
stitch or Bach stitch and then this is

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.899 
stitch or Bach stitch and then this is
your<00:01:57.369> new<00:01:57.610> row<00:01:57.849> and<00:01:58.119> it's<00:01:58.360> creating<00:01:59.909> where

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
your new row and it's creating where

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.249 
your new row and it's creating where
it's<00:02:01.060> closing<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.659> this<00:02:02.619> gap<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.579> have

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
it's closing up this gap that you have

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.339 
it's closing up this gap that you have
right<00:02:05.259> here<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:07.989> want<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.170> take

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
right here and then you want to take

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.770 
right here and then you want to take
your<00:02:08.530> hook<00:02:08.769> and<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.239> do<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.420> your

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
your hook and just like you do on your

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.729 
your hook and just like you do on your
other<00:02:10.959> rows<00:02:12.030> pull<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> bottom<00:02:13.480> loop<00:02:13.690> over<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
other rows pull the bottom loop over the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.860 
other rows pull the bottom loop over the
top<00:02:14.829> loop<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:16.150> want<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.359> do<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.569> all<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.750> way

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
top loop you want to do that all the way

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.119 
top loop you want to do that all the way
around<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.410> both<00:02:17.470> sides

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
around on both sides

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.339 
around on both sides
I<00:02:20.129> finished<00:02:21.239> pulling<00:02:22.239> my<00:02:22.329> stitches<00:02:22.780> over<00:02:22.959> top

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
I finished pulling my stitches over top

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.610 
I finished pulling my stitches over top
of<00:02:23.680> each<00:02:23.859> other<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.310> then<00:02:24.910> I'm<00:02:25.180> going<00:02:25.510> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
of each other and then I'm going to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.190 
of each other and then I'm going to
continue<00:02:26.620> doing<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.880> would<00:02:28.450> normally<00:02:28.870> be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
continue doing what would normally be

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.150 
continue doing what would normally be
the<00:02:29.230> regular<00:02:29.470> box<00:02:29.889> stitch<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.519> top<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.859> this<00:02:32.859> so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
the regular box stitch on top of this so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the regular box stitch on top of this so
I'm<00:02:33.310> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> follow<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.849> exact<00:02:34.120> same

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
I'm going to follow the exact same

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.640 
I'm going to follow the exact same
pattern<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.930> did<00:02:35.579> just<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.730> second<00:02:37.030> ago

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
pattern that I did just a second ago

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.229 
pattern that I did just a second ago

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
completed eight rows of the seconds

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.629 
completed eight rows of the seconds
second<00:03:30.459> part<00:03:30.819> of<00:03:30.940> these<00:03:31.120> honeycomb<00:03:32.049> effect

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
second part of these honeycomb effect

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.069 
second part of these honeycomb effect
again<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.789> first<00:03:33.970> part<00:03:34.090> was<00:03:34.570> where<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.930> just

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
again the first part was where you just

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.300 
again the first part was where you just
do<00:03:35.199> your<00:03:35.320> double<00:03:35.500> rib<00:03:35.739> stitch<00:03:35.979> in<00:03:36.130> one

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310

direction

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.660 
direction
and<00:03:37.209> then<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.409> second<00:03:38.799> part<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.159> that<00:03:39.220> you

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
and then the second part is that you

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.619 
and then the second part is that you
change<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.450> direction<00:03:40.599> of<00:03:41.049> your<00:03:42.480> double<00:03:43.480> rib

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
change the direction of your double rib

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.149 
change the direction of your double rib
stitch<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.409> can<00:03:44.560> see<00:03:44.799> what<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.099> is

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
stitch and you can see what this is

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.880 
stitch and you can see what this is
doing<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.840> here<00:03:46.840> there<00:03:46.989> was<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.110> gap<00:03:47.379> and<00:03:47.680> now

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
doing is here there was a gap and now

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.470 
doing is here there was a gap and now
you're<00:03:48.280> double<00:03:48.459> rib<00:03:48.730> stitches<00:03:49.090> above<00:03:49.209> your

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
you're double rib stitches above your

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.000 
you're double rib stitches above your
gap<00:03:49.659> so<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:50.950> creating<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:53.530> starting<00:03:53.920> to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
gap so it's creating it's starting to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.890 
gap so it's creating it's starting to
create<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.250> honeycomb<00:03:54.640> effect<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.569> now<00:03:55.720> what

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
create a honeycomb effect so now what

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.569 
create a honeycomb effect so now what
I'm<00:03:55.989> going<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.379> is<00:03:56.620> I'm<00:03:56.950> going<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.220> go<00:03:57.370> back

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.160 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back
to<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.000> original<00:03:58.420> direction<00:03:58.569> that<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.019> was

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
to the original direction that I was

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.940 
to the original direction that I was
doing<00:03:59.500> with<00:04:00.040> my<00:04:00.099> double<00:04:00.540> rib<00:04:01.540> stitch<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.650> again

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
doing with my double rib stitch so again

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.319 
doing with my double rib stitch so again
I'm<00:04:03.129> going<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.370> change<00:04:03.610> direction<00:04:03.879> of<00:04:04.390> my<00:04:05.349> yarn

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
I'm going to change direction of my yarn

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.119 
I'm going to change direction of my yarn
you<00:04:07.329> go<00:04:07.450> across<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.170> then<00:04:08.349> you<00:04:08.709> want<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:08.920> wrap

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
you go across and then you want to wrap

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.190 
you go across and then you want to wrap
right<00:04:10.000> here<00:04:10.209> where<00:04:10.329> there's<00:04:10.480> no<00:04:10.629> yarn

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
right here where there's no yarn

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.750 
right here where there's no yarn
you've<00:04:11.709> got<00:04:11.890> yarn<00:04:12.129> here<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.519> you<00:04:12.579> don't<00:04:12.640> want

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
you've got yarn here and you don't want

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
you've got yarn here and you don't want
to<00:04:12.879> trace<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.390> want<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.599> go<00:04:13.660> where

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
to trace that you want to go where

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.310 
to trace that you want to go where
there's<00:04:13.900> no<00:04:14.019> yarn<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.849> again<00:04:15.849> you<00:04:16.000> do<00:04:16.150> your

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
there's no yarn and again you do your

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.920 
there's no yarn and again you do your
your<00:04:17.320> box<00:04:17.590> stitch<00:04:17.769> or<00:04:18.160> your<00:04:18.570> double<00:04:19.570> rib

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
your box stitch or your double rib

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.620 
your box stitch or your double rib
stitch<00:04:21.240> and<00:04:22.860> then<00:04:24.030> you're<00:04:25.030> just<00:04:25.210> continue

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
stitch and then you're just continue

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.400 
stitch and then you're just continue
knitting<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:26.050> way<00:04:26.289> all<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.130> way<00:04:27.190> down<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
knitting this way all the way down and

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.710 
knitting this way all the way down and
then<00:04:29.410> what<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.949> get<00:04:30.449> after<00:04:31.590> several<00:04:32.590> rows

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
then what you get after several rows

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.060 
then what you get after several rows
this<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> sample<00:04:35.350> that<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.500> made<00:04:35.680> where<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:35.860> did

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
this is a sample that I made where I did

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.340 
this is a sample that I made where I did
five<00:04:36.280> rows<00:04:36.550> of<00:04:36.580> each<00:04:37.090> but<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.199> that

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
five rows of each but you can see that

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.159 
five rows of each but you can see that
you<00:04:38.410> get<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:38.740> looks<00:04:39.100> kind<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.550> a

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
you get it looks kind of like a

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.080 
you get it looks kind of like a
honeycomb<00:04:41.169> so<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.070> have<00:04:42.190> your<00:04:42.340> gap<00:04:42.490> your<00:04:42.880> ribs

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
honeycomb so you have your gap your ribs

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.870 
honeycomb so you have your gap your ribs
in<00:04:43.360> your<00:04:43.510> gap<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:45.280> makes<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.820> very

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
in your gap and this makes for a very

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.690 
in your gap and this makes for a very
stretchy<00:04:47.220> blanket<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.460> very<00:04:48.639> soft<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.520> that's

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
stretchy blanket and very soft so that's

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.990 
stretchy blanket and very soft so that's
how<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:51.880> do<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.270> honeycomb<00:04:52.720> effect
