00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.510
 Welcome to American Tuhao BBQ 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.560
 Today we are going to do T-bone steak. 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.440
 Is Man awesome? 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 Someone has to ask what is T-bone steak? 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.550
 Come to you 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.240
 This is actually a steak two in one. 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.250
 This piece is the front lumbar spine. He is called the New York lumbar spine. 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.080
 There is also a loin on this side. 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.380
 Man 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.960
 When you buy steak, you need bright red and rich marble patterns. 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.300
 You can discharge the cows on the grill. 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.280
 Did you hear that 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.600
 Nothing compares to the feeling of grilling steak on the grill 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.130
 What we have to do is to bake both sides. 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.480
 Each piece is about 4 to 5 minutes 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.740
 This helps lock the gravy 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.810
 Can you smell it? 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.440
 Man smells like a Guuud! 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.430
 If you like to eat three-point cooked or four-quarter cooked 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.570
 It’s almost ready to take it now. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.440
 Today we have to eat five minutes 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.720
 Come to show you how you won’t overcook 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.680
 Pick them up 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.870
 Put it on the opposite side of the charcoal fire 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.720
 Then cover the lid to control the flame 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 The rest of the time, the small fire slowly grilled steak 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 These are almost cooked 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.940
 Then heat it up on high heat. 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.340
 Can eat it 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.160
 Are you hungry? 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.900
 Oh man 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.040
 Nothing compares to T-bone steak 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.050
 Oh, oh 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.210
 Ok, cut it. 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.560
 Like I said, this is a five-pronged 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.660
 But the closer to the bone 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.360
 The closer to the quarter 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 Cut the anterior lumbar spine 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.870
 Oh, it’s tender 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.780
 Put a little salt and pepper 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.730
 Then just eat in front of you. 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.600
 Next time you look for a barbecue steak 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.910
 Let’s try the T-bone steak. 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.220
