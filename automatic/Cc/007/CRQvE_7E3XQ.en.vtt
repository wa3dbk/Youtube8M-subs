 Anime series intended for consoles

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.840
 you can already try thanks to the launch 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.680
 of its dismount the one that here you have 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 our impressions 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.469
 as it is saga already has us 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 accustomed we are again before a 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.440
 fighting game although with the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.420
 peculiarity that now the fighting 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.219
 they will be fought in groups something that makes 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.629
 the title is very oriented in this 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.629
 occasion towards the multiplayer side 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.540
 in this sense the game will offer us 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.490
 three main modalities being the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.800
 first of them the single player mode 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.510
 consisting this to exceed about 60 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.190
 missions that will recreate battles 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.260
 Inspired by the various arches 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.970
 plot of the anime itself and to 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.860
 we will have to form a team of 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.770
 Up to four characters taking us 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.630
 the direct control of one of them the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.130
 three remaining will be controlled by 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.960
 artificial intelligence and we 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.229
 they will lend their support fighting our 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.229
 side 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.760
 yes 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.680
 from there each of the missions 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.720
 of the game will move us to scenarios of 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.670
 quite open battle very much in style 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.350
 of the seen in the series could fall so 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.240
 that we can move with complete 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.040
 freedom in order to defeat 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.520
 the opponents that are proposed to us in 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.520
 each level 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.150
 for now the squad of fighters 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.130
 confirmed with the ones you play will be around 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.380
 the 70 characters if we consider 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.420
 that many of them will be present in 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.250
 its various transformations as per 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
 example in its normal or super state 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.510
 saiyan we must also mention that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.520
 everyone will be specialized in a 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.380
 particular style of fighting as if 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.270
 classes were treated which 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.090
 they call melee support 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.950
 interference and bursts in this way 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.630
 the melee characters are the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.550
 what more damage will they do with their kicks and 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.980
 punching in close combat while 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.170
 that the bursts are the most powerful in 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.690
 the somewhat longer distances throwing 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.520
 devastating rays of energy for its 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.590
 part of the support above all will help 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.540
 the rest of the team being able to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.030
 to recover the energy of an ally 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.770
 very even reanimate it and finally the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.750
 interference characters will do what 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.700
 opposite taking charge of paralyzing and 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.709
 hinder the enemies knowing 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.990
 also many wrestlers that are a 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.240
 mix of two different kinds as per 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.430
 example race of interference so 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.430
 the combinations are even wider 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.890
 with unity 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.870
 likewise another detail to mention is 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.820
 that as you play the characters 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.920
 they will go up in level and we will also go 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.020
 unlocking collectible cards that 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.280
 we will be able to equip fighters and 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.770
 this way get different 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.960
 bonuses associated with them as a 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.550
 increase in health a recovery more 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.320
 fast energy 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.540
 or do more damage in our attacks 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.640
 among other possibilities being also 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.709
 possible to buy objects with points 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.550
 that we go getting you rewards 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.550
 after each fight 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.650
 otherwise we tell ourselves that next to 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.360
 one player mode we have two others 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.250
 more modalities which undoubtedly 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.349
 they promise to become the principal 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.360
 attractiveness of the title in the case of a 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.580
 cooperative mode where we can play 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.500
 the missions via online forming a team 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.360
 together with three other users and the mode 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.280
 battle in which we will fight in a way 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.290
 competitive in confrontations up to 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.510
 other players while this one in turn 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.890
 divided into several more modalities with 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.890
 different rules to win 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.260
 already to be finalized in relation to the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.060
 gameplay keeps many of 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.220
 the identity signs seen in the 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.200
 previous titles of the saga although al 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.120
 now have up to 8 fighters in a 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.460
 same combat everything turns out something more 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.530
 Chaotic is also more fun 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.570
 making it even possible to perform 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.460
 joint attacks with other members of the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.740
 team to combine the skills 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.750
 of each one of them what added to the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.630
 use of the cards all the game of a 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.220
 very strategic touch however we have 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.870
 to say that from what we've seen in 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.120
 the demo the control of the characters 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.510
 seems to give us a whole all that 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.510
 should 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.960
 from his point of view 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.060
 visual we will not meet a priori with 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.430
 too many surprises had a marked 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.620
 look on the set and sitting down 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.600
 characters an aspect almost in taiwan of 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.520
 the cartoon series while 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.680
 that the scenarios are much more 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.050
 loose since these are very empty and 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.800
 they do not have just interaction or elements 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.800
 destructible 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.790
 to be able to have in our hands the 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.590
 full version of the game bring the 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.420
 your video analysis where we will give you 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.980
 know our final valuation no 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.170
 we will have to wait too long since 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.270
 dragon ball z for the love will come to 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.740
 the stores from this next 24 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.740
 January in all its versions 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500
 Y 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.030
 with this love 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.030
 the casting
