00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 eighth row i make 3 air loops 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.550
 expand the work and the beach ca 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.320
 and started as usual in the arch with 2 air 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:23.760
 loops knit 2 double crochet 2 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.390
 air loops 2 double crochet 8 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.390
 air loops 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.180
 I see in the arch of 8 air loops 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.180
 volume bar 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.530
 3 air loops in the arch of 3 air 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.700
 loops see 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.700
 volume bar 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:15.250
 3 air loops in the arch of 6 air 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.900
 I knit loops 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.900
 again a volumetric column 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 next I knit 7 air loops 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:58.730
 starting from the second loop I knit on medium 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:02:04.910
 6 hinged bollards without crochet 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.460
 further do 8 air loops 7 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.170
 air loops 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.170
 I see the park surround column 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.670
 3 air loops in the arch of 3 air 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.670
 loops again volumetric column 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.040
 3 air loops in the arch of 8 air 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.040
 loops again volumetric column 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.730
 8 air loops 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.480
 and as usual from 2 air loops 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:17.910
 I knit 2 columns without nakida 2 air 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:20.990
 loops and 2 double crochet and so on 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:26.880
 I got 8 rows 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:29.700
 9 row do 3 air loops and a plate 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.920
 expanding work in the arch of two 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.050
 air five loops as usual 2 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:45.440
 double crochet 2 air loops 2 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:45.440
 double crochet 8 air loops 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.560
 in the arch of 8 air loops that is 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.720
 it turns out in each of these arches I 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.900
 I knit on the volumetric column that is 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.420
 get 4 volumetric columns here it is 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.420
 first and between them 3 air loops 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.510
 3 air loops in the next arch again 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.510
 volume bar 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.919
 3 air loops in the next arch 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.919
 volume bar 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:50.119
 3 air loops and the last arch too 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.119
 volume bar 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.199
 further I knit 8 air loops 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:21.990
 and in the central 4 loop knit one by one 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:21.990
 single crochet 8 air loops and 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.110
 further mirror reflection see what 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.630
 here also we knit and here every arch 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.800
 I see on the volumetric column between them 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.800
 three air dive 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.360
 3 air loops in the next arch again 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.360
 same volumetric bar 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.070
 3 air loops and the last arch 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.070
 volume bar 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.849
 8 air loops 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:41.050
 and the last arch of 2 air loops 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:46.590
 as usual 2 double crochet 2 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.590
 air loops 2 double crochet poles and 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.699
 so it turned out we have 9 rows 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.699
 as we see we already have a bunch of grapes 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.699
 loom
