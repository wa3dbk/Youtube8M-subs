shadow<00:00:04.620> pallet<00:00:04.950> jack<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.580> guess<00:00:05.790> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
shadow pallet jack this is I guess a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.570 
shadow pallet jack this is I guess a
more<00:00:06.240> budget-friendly<00:00:07.010> bill<00:00:08.010> but<00:00:08.460> it

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
more budget-friendly bill but it

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
more budget-friendly bill but it
contains<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.240> lot<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> older<00:00:09.900> shuffling

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
contains a lot of the older shuffling

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.770 
contains a lot of the older shuffling
cards<00:00:12.590> so<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.799> contains<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.549> new<00:00:14.759> grade<00:00:15.420> 3

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
cards so it contains the new grade 3

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.779 
cards so it contains the new grade 3
which<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.350> course<00:00:16.379> tells<00:00:16.830> me<00:00:17.010> detain<00:00:17.369> I'm

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
which of course tells me detain I'm

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.210 
which of course tells me detain I'm
trying<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.590> would<00:00:19.710> play<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
trying to see how you would play this

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890 
trying to see how you would play this
card<00:00:20.490> because<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.210> those<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.660> very

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
card because it's one of those it's very

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920 
card because it's one of those it's very
much<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.880> it's<00:00:23.880> almost<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> murakumo

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
much like a it's almost like a murakumo

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.250 
much like a it's almost like a murakumo
type<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> Vanguard<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.580> sense<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
type of Vanguard in a sense that it is a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
type of Vanguard in a sense that it is a
defensive<00:00:28.800> type<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> card<00:00:29.550> instead<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> an

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
defensive type of card instead of an

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
defensive type of card instead of an
offensive<00:00:30.539> Vanguard<00:00:31.160> especially<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
offensive Vanguard especially in the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.470 
offensive Vanguard especially in the
late<00:00:32.399> game<00:00:32.579> because<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.090> its<00:00:33.239> limit

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
late game because that's when its limit

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
late game because that's when its limit
break<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> active<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.309> car<00:00:35.579> would

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
break is active I think this car would

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
break is active I think this car would
be<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> lot<00:00:36.000> better<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.540> didn't<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
be a lot better if it didn't have the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
be a lot better if it didn't have the
limit<00:00:37.440> break<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.040> able<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> use<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> at

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
limit break if it was able to use it at

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.170 
limit break if it was able to use it at
all<00:00:38.850> times<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.160> starter<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> still<00:00:41.910> full

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
all times so the starter is still full

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540 
all times so the starter is still full
down<00:00:42.590> we're<00:00:43.590> still<00:00:43.800> running<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> full<00:00:44.340> ride

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
down we're still running the full ride

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
down we're still running the full ride
chain<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> blaster<00:00:45.629> dark<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.829> only

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
chain with the blaster dark the only

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
chain with the blaster dark the only
difference<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.399> there's<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:47.789> longer<00:00:48.239> I'm

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
difference is that there's no longer I'm

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
difference is that there's no longer I'm
not<00:00:48.629> running<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> Phantom<00:00:49.500> placer<00:00:49.800> overlord

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
not running the Phantom placer overlord

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.779 
not running the Phantom placer overlord

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
in here so there's no cross ride I had

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.130 
in here so there's no cross ride I had
to<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.570> room<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.710 
effect so yeah do it on main phase which
is<00:04:44.110> really<00:04:44.410> bad<00:04:45.060> main<00:04:46.060> reason<00:04:46.360> why<00:04:46.420> he's<00:04:46.570> still

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720
