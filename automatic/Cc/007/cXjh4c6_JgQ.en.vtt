00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
Trees it's in the key of F major which

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.820 
Trees it's in the key of F major which
is<00:00:09.389> F<00:00:09.630> de<00:00:10.620> C<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.170> F

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:25.900 

the<00:00:16.640> intro<00:00:16.970> melody<00:00:17.150> starts<00:00:17.600> on<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:25.640> intro

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
the intro melody starts on a the intro

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.350 
the intro melody starts on a the intro
harmony<00:00:26.300> starts<00:00:26.600> on<00:00:26.720> F<00:00:30.490> then<00:00:31.490> goes<00:00:31.700> down<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.880> b5

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
harmony starts on F then goes down to b5

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:43.540 
harmony starts on F then goes down to b5
so<00:00:35.530> one<00:00:36.530> more<00:00:36.680> time<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.890> little<00:00:37.010> slower<00:00:42.340> down<00:00:43.340> to

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
so one more time a little slower down to

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.340 
so one more time a little slower down to
b-flat<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.440> then<00:00:49.129> jumps<00:00:49.519> up<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:50.350> these

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
b-flat and then jumps up to here these

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.959 
b-flat and then jumps up to here these
two<00:00:51.590> nodes<00:00:51.739> would<00:00:51.920> sit<00:00:52.129> which<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.430> DM<00:00:52.820> and

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
two nodes would sit which is a DM and

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.069 
two nodes would sit which is a DM and
b-flat<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:55.300> if<00:00:56.300> you've<00:00:56.449> heard<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.690> song<00:00:56.870> you

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
b-flat and if you've heard the song you

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.900 
b-flat and if you've heard the song you
would<00:00:57.170> recognize<00:00:57.469> where<00:00:57.859> that<00:00:58.010> goes<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:58.550> I'm

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
would recognize where that goes so I'm

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.220 
would recognize where that goes so I'm
gonna<00:00:59.059> play<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.359> one<00:00:59.480> more<00:00:59.600> time<00:00:59.750> so<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.050> pay

with<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.540> D<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.080> b-flat<00:01:36.490> now<00:01:37.490> I'm<00:01:37.580> gonna

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
with the D and the b-flat now I'm gonna

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.370 
with the D and the b-flat now I'm gonna
play<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:37.970> melody<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.540> little<00:01:38.810> slower<00:01:39.080> with

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
play that melody a little slower with

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.750 
play that melody a little slower with
our<00:01:39.500> harmonic<00:01:39.920> progression<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.550> left

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
our harmonic progression in the left

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.270 
our harmonic progression in the left
hand<00:01:40.970> which<00:01:41.180> goes<00:01:41.390> from<00:01:41.630> F<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:43.490> C<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.740> B<00:01:45.950> flat

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
hand which goes from F to C to B flat

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.490 
hand which goes from F to C to B flat
and<00:01:46.780> then<00:01:47.780> back<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.110> C<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:50.690> pay<00:01:51.020> attention<00:01:51.050> I'm

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
and then back to C so pay attention I'm

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.980 
and then back to C so pay attention I'm
gonna<00:01:51.650> I'm<00:01:51.890> gonna<00:01:51.980> or<00:01:52.370> try<00:01:52.520> try<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.760> stay<00:01:53.750> along

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
with it I'm gonna play it a little

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:19.530 
with it I'm gonna play it a little
slower<00:01:55.430> so

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.940 

and<00:02:20.540> then<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> would<00:02:21.349> repeat<00:02:21.709> what<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.890> just

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and then you would repeat what I just

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:39.240 
and then you would repeat what I just
played<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.489> more<00:02:22.610> time<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:23.360> more<00:02:23.480> time

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.550 

instead<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.370> jumping<00:02:40.549> up<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.480> these<00:02:42.349> two

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
instead of jumping up to the these two

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.110 
instead of jumping up to the these two
notes<00:02:42.739> here<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:44.120> actually<00:02:44.630> go<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:45.019> b-flat

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.009 

so<00:02:50.120> once<00:02:50.269> again<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.569> goes<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:50.810> this

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.910 

and<00:02:54.819> that<00:02:55.819> melody<00:02:56.180> leads<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:57.079> into<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.590> chorus

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
and that melody leads up into the chorus

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.680 
and that melody leads up into the chorus
line<00:02:58.010> now<00:02:58.819> I'm<00:02:59.030> going<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.299> show<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.540> how<00:02:59.660> to

harmonic progression the chorus line

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.620 
harmonic progression the chorus line
goes<00:03:07.640> from<00:03:07.819> an<00:03:07.910> F<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:09.130> an<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.620> b-flat<00:03:13.010> and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
goes from an F to an a to a b-flat and

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.170 
goes from an F to an a to a b-flat and
then<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> C<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.430> more<00:03:16.430> specifically<00:03:16.940> F

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
then to a C and more specifically F

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.960 
then to a C and more specifically F
major<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:19.340> another<00:03:19.609> F<00:03:19.790> major<00:03:20.000> chord<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> B

major to another F major chord to a B

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.590 
major to another F major chord to a B
flat<00:03:23.150> chord<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:24.819> then<00:03:25.819> to<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> C<00:03:26.209> major<00:03:26.420> chord

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
flat chord and then to a C major chord

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.849 
flat chord and then to a C major chord
or<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.889> 5/7<00:03:28.639> if<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.819> want<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.060> add<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.420> b-flat

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.319 

so<00:03:33.859> I'm<00:03:34.220> gonna<00:03:34.370> play<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.700> right<00:03:34.850> hand<00:03:34.910> a

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
so I'm gonna play the right hand a

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.629 
so I'm gonna play the right hand a
little<00:03:35.930> slower<00:03:36.260> with<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.680> left<00:03:36.859> hand<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
little slower with the left hand in a

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:57.100 
little slower with the left hand in a
simplified<00:03:37.970> way

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.390 

remember<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.170> goes<00:03:58.290> down<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.800> here<00:04:01.400> then

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
remember it goes down to the a here then

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:30.380 
remember it goes down to the a here then
I'll<00:04:02.550> repeat<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.700> obviously<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.300> goes

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
I'll repeat it so obviously it goes

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.760 
I'll repeat it so obviously it goes
right<00:04:30.570> back<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.960> beginning<00:04:31.260> from<00:04:31.530> there

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
right back to the beginning from there

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.830 
right back to the beginning from there
so<00:04:32.340> what<00:04:32.460> I'm<00:04:32.550> going<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.700> do<00:04:32.790> now<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.360> play<00:04:33.630> both

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
so what I'm going to do now is play both

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.170 
so what I'm going to do now is play both
hands<00:04:34.110> together<00:04:34.470> with<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.190> little<00:04:35.820> slower<00:04:36.030> than

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
hands together with a little slower than

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.700 
hands together with a little slower than
the<00:04:36.270> original<00:04:36.630> song<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.290> kind<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.560> pay

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
the original song so you can kind of pay

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.620 
the original song so you can kind of pay
attention<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.220> how<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.460> harmony<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
attention to how the harmony and the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.350 
attention to how the harmony and the
melody<00:04:40.080> goes<00:04:40.260> together<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:41.460> um<00:04:41.670> try<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.210> pay

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
melody goes together but um try to pay

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.520 
melody goes together but um try to pay
attention<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.840> what<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.110> right<00:04:43.230> hand<00:04:43.440> is

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
attention to what the right hand is

00:04:43.530 --> 00:06:06.590 
attention to what the right hand is
doing<00:04:43.680> with<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.250> left<00:04:44.430> hand

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.910 

so<00:06:07.600> this<00:06:07.750> piece<00:06:07.960> is<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.140> little<00:06:08.200> more<00:06:08.560> complex

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
so this piece is a little more complex

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.560 
so this piece is a little more complex
than<00:06:09.130> most<00:06:09.430> pieces<00:06:09.700> because<00:06:10.150> there's<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.390> lot

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
than most pieces because there's a lot

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.450 
than most pieces because there's a lot
of<00:06:10.720> syncopation<00:06:11.110> there's<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.950> lot<00:06:12.160> of<00:06:12.250> movement

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
of syncopation there's a lot of movement

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.280 
of syncopation there's a lot of movement
in<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:12.730> right<00:06:12.880> hand<00:06:13.090> there's<00:06:13.270> not<00:06:13.420> a<00:06:13.450> steady

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
in the right hand there's not a steady

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.320 
in the right hand there's not a steady
melody<00:06:14.800> that's<00:06:15.160> always<00:06:15.460> playing<00:06:15.850> that<00:06:15.970> that

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
melody that's always playing that that

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.110 
melody that's always playing that that
can<00:06:16.480> that<00:06:16.600> can<00:06:16.990> always<00:06:17.170> be<00:06:17.320> said<00:06:17.740> to<00:06:18.010> you<00:06:18.970> know
