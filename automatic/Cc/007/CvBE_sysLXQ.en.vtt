00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.009

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.960

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 Already in the hang out mitbekommt there have 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.699
 we can do that a bit 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.289

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.509

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.730
 we plan together with sepp from 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.860
 pete smith in eleven against eleven to play 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.840
 in pro club mode that means yes 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.420
 That's only possible there really 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.090
 eleven people and the fw people on the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.280
 other side so 22 in total each 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.510
 from a single person to a real one 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.610
 person to be controlled 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.060
 Yes and I think that will definitely 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.910
 really funny the whole takes place on 15 8 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.220
 this thursday at 19 o'clock 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.680
 we play at the ps3 in the pro club 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.240
 Mode as I said so if you have a ps3 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 has and no pro then make you 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.130
 rather now the days is still a yes 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.170
 a little more time and apply 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.600
 you can do this by following him 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 easy on facebook on our facebook 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.829
 page goes to the left in the description and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.380
 There we are giving away as a bi park 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.990
 gaming team six more places because 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.229
 We are five so once said 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.109
 mandant it painted and me plus the new one 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.390
 the course of this action is presented 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.420
 who will play there and at seb is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.310
 yes so he from the piz alone with that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.530
 speedteam view represents plus 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.909
 Of course, ten people of you still and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.770
 you can apply simply by 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.609
 you should open her under this post 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.149
 recognize every case 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.409
 The design is I think yes 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.689
 meaningful under this post easy 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.920
 as with the last projection the 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.280
 we have made a creative 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.719
 Application exactly why you contribute 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.429
 us in the team should be there 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.579
 or at sap in the team he becomes 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:58.990
 also share the banner on the pz 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.029
 page and link to both in the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.279
 description and then we search the 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.020
 Six most creative applications from and 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:07.840
 even the ten most creative and then 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.849
 is still a replacement gelooss that would be 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 three people are each still as 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.670
 replacement man available if 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.800
 somehow someone can not or if 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.340
 someone does not notice such reports 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.530
 stuff 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.379
 and yes, I think that will definitely 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.849
 really cool right action 220 people 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.230
 on a field I have never had it 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.550
 We did not do the others either 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.590
 It's sure to be happy 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.620
 total chaos but certainly correct 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.940
 funny yes and i am also the video what 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250
 then arise will be curious and so 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.560
 continue 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.390
 it will be absolutely funny, I think 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.930
 and the new one is the one we represent 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.549
 also before 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
 then i would say hello together that 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.080
 Peet with him for it can be natural 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.489
 a few of you are constantly covering because 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.110
 then of course also places available 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.670
 but I think we take that 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.140
 Do not be angry then we will count 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.390
 on the six people then with us 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.250
 and then the thing rocks and shows 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.519
 the same but the hammer hangs 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.860
 well, all right so thursday 15 eighth 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.840

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.700
