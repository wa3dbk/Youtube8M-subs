way now I don't really recommend plywood
for<00:01:13.860> animation<00:01:14.400> sets<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> cheaper

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
for animation sets but it's a cheaper

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.210 
for animation sets but it's a cheaper
wood<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> great<00:01:16.259> way<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> start<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:16.950> our

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
wood and a great way to start off our

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.090 
wood and a great way to start off our
first<00:01:17.460> animation<00:01:18.259> next<00:01:19.259> let's<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.950> our

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
first animation next let's take out our

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
first animation next let's take out our
heavy-duty<00:01:20.369> top<00:01:20.820> plates<00:01:21.119> they're<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> triangle

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
heavy-duty top plates they're a triangle

shape that comes with five screws and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
shape that comes with five screws and
will<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.030> used<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> grip<00:01:24.600> our<00:01:24.720> Parsons<00:01:25.200> legs<00:01:25.470> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
will be used to grip our Parsons legs we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
will be used to grip our Parsons legs we
want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> attach<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.970> plate<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> each<00:01:27.600> corner

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
want to attach one plate to each corner

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200 
want to attach one plate to each corner
on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> bottom<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> our<00:01:28.920> board<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.460> recommend

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
on the bottom of our board I recommend

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
on the bottom of our board I recommend
leaving<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.810> centimeter<00:01:31.380> between<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
leaving about a centimeter between the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.789 
leaving about a centimeter between the
edges<00:01:32.479> easiest<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> attach<00:01:34.079> these<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
edges easiest way to attach these is to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
edges easiest way to attach these is to
first<00:01:35.040> use<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> pencil<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> mark<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> center

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
first use the pencil to mark the center

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.200 
first use the pencil to mark the center
of<00:01:36.810> each<00:01:36.990> plate<00:01:37.320> hole<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.549> drill<00:01:38.790> bit<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
of each plate hole use your drill bit to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179 
of each plate hole use your drill bit to
start<00:01:39.540> off<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.930> hole<00:01:40.110> only<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.920> poking

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
start off your hole only really poking

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
start off your hole only really poking
the<00:01:41.460> surface<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> wood<00:01:42.270> next<00:01:43.079> bring<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the surface of the wood next bring the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
the surface of the wood next bring the
plate<00:01:44.040> back<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.579> use<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> screwdriver<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
plate back and use the screwdriver to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.139 
plate back and use the screwdriver to
start<00:01:45.960> inserting<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> screws<00:01:46.920> finish<00:01:47.700> off<00:01:47.909> by

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
start inserting the screws finish off by

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
start inserting the screws finish off by
using<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.630> phillips<00:01:48.869> drill<00:01:49.259> head<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
using your phillips drill head for a

using your phillips drill head for a
faster<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:50.520> secure<00:01:50.850> attachment<00:01:51.689> once

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
faster and more secure attachment once

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.410 
faster and more secure attachment once
you've<00:01:52.799> done<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.009> apply<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.820> other<00:01:54.060> plates

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you've done that apply the other plates

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.190 
you've done that apply the other plates
to<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> remaining<00:01:55.200> corners

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.440 

now<00:02:01.830> we're<00:02:02.040> ready<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.310> attach<00:02:02.759> our<00:02:02.939> Parsons

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
now we're ready to attach our Parsons
