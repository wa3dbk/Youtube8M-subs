00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.400
 this book is about communication 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.160
 the patient is now also a dentist 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 in dentistry it is establishing a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.859
 bio-psycho intervention model 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 that is, social care is no longer taken only by 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.960
 pathology of the patient but we take it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.840
 care of the person made of body 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.000
 emotions experienced personally in this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.860
 sense communication is a real e 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.870
 own moment of care 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.850
 when we talk to the patient there 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 we relate to the patient we are 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 already looking after the question that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.149
 we must ask ourselves is this we know 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 certainly when we make a mistake 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.350
 in implantology in endodontics and thanks 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
 to this awareness 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.090
 we can remedy it, but for how much 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 regards the communication we have the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.460
 communicative skills that there 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.770
 let us know if and where we have 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.719
 wrong when the relationship with the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.330
 patient took an unexpected path 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.850
 we know how to interpret the signs of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.490
 rejection tension that the patient 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.830
 constantly on his way with his body 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 we can talk to the patient in a way 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.299
 such as to decipher exactly what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.710
 mean his words 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.500
 this book analyzes all of them 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.479
 these themes are the body language of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.360
 contents that the patient tells us 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.100
 through his exposition and teaches 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.470
 to interpret them correctly and to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.229
 adequately answer the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.110
 communicative competence is not a theme 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 abstract of which to discuss but produces 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.630
 real and measurable results increase 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.970
 patient adherence to ours 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 therapies increases acceptance of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.130
 our quotes improves the climate on 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.140
 workplace decreases all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 phenomena of professional demotivation 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.909
 and therefore learn to communicate in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.350
 optimal way is really one 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.320
 essential competence for each 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.509
 There are many situations in dentists 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.060
 which the patient sends messages to 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.340
 rejection of tension and situations 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.099
 in which we send messages not 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.330
 positive for the patient to acquire this 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.730
 awareness is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.130
 determinant in the book through the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.470
 photographic simulations are put 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.020
 in evidence precisely these moments yes 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.660
 will see for example that it is wrong 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.270
 the habit of talking behind the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.000
 patient forcing him to turn around for 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 look at each other you will see that it is wrong 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.930
 talk about with the mask on your mouth 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.300
 with the gloves worn because these 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.400
 are barriers that arise between us and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.520
 he will see that it is much more functional 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.310
 and talk to the patient sitting in front of 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.170
 he at the same eye height and also 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.090
 when for example they enter the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.980
 report other people such as 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.740
 accompanying our 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.959
 orientation in space allow to 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.670
 their inclusion or exclusion and it 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.580
 we will see from photographic simulations 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.310
 in interpersonal communication between 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.830
 people are fundamental to the three channels 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.980
 that we use to transfer ours 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.060
 messages the verbal channel ie the things 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.430
 what we say 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 the paraverbale canal, that is, the way in 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.630
 which we use our voice for 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.700
 express these concepts and the channel 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.830
 non-verbal all the ways in which 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.700
 we use our body to send 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.400
 these messages 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.010
 in the book will be examined with great 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.470
 Pay attention to these channels and you will understand 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.360
 how to interpret the deep 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.340
 meaning of things that we patience 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.400
 he says and how to answer him adequately 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.920
 you will understand how to interpret from the tone 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.810
 of the voice an emotion a feeling e 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.150
 how to respond appropriately e 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.070
 above all you will understand how the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.470
 non-verbal language as ours 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.580
 body influences communication 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.600
 then every element of communication will be 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.180
 applied relationship don't or other 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.330
 patient with many examples is not 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.489
 possible not to communicate anything 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.860
 humans do communicate 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.900
 something then you might as well do it in 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.690
 effectively learn to communicate 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.340
 well because we'll see that in the relationship with 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.040
 the patient this aspect is 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.930
 decisive for sanctioning quality 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.850
 of our professional experience 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
 of our private life and for 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.820
 improve the perception by the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.450
 patient of dental performance 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.450
 good reading to all
