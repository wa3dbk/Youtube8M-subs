00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.840
 Tell me guys, what did I get with more life? 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 for you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:13.290
 and today I'm with an ex-gay man and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.289
 Welcome to our eighth episode at 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.900
 my eighth map episode and this one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.689
 staff is the focus on hell on nm that I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 I created here is based on youtube 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 I can even leave the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 link of his video in the description is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 so now you're going to have to put 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.030
 fire 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:43.440
 here in the wood on the bottom and you 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 run deep up there to survive 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.149
 let's put this into practice it will not 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.329
 count on you 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.710
 No, this is not going to change anything. 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.710
 I still know if it will 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 monk 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.430
 soon soon it will rise again 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.250
 it will fall under 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.820
 then she will fall to working eva 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 hence she is falling alone was kind of 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.600
 mt branch 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.550
 sister fell in mine is also because 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.910
 Of fire 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:45.330
 recording and playing there almost looking 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:51.990
 to the phase 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:57.800
 the priest was flooded in the face already 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.800
 Cardozo does not take his age 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.220
 A rule that I violated now does not 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.850
 can be stopped a long time ago now it 's 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.240
 because you could not move right 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.240
 when there 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.370
 it's breaking things 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 the guy breaking everything down 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.340
 oh yeah 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.040
 You come here but you have not fallen once. 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.040
 I know what I want no one standing 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.150
 ae 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.860
 the human being face 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.500
 Stopped and left the game. 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.800
 I 'm not going to another 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.040
 oh drop 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.010
 so that's it , this is what I'm talking about 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.060

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.190
 description and then you can battle for 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.200
 your law friends stay in hard longer 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.470
 can not stay still any way 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.610
 I think it's because I was not going to fall because 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.130
 was thin one on the other side and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.990

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.240
