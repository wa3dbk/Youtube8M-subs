00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 so the first step is to download the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.290
 that is the locomotive and the wagon that you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.380

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 I also have it on my computer so I do not 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.570

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.260
