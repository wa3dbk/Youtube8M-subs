of<00:00:07.740> all<00:00:07.859> software<00:00:08.370> research<00:00:08.700> how<00:00:09.300> can<00:00:09.599> 48

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
of all software research how can 48

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
of all software research how can 48
course<00:00:10.800> be<00:00:11.160> programmed<00:00:11.759> that's<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.389> real

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
course be programmed that's a real

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.480 
course be programmed that's a real
challenge<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.679> second<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.309> about

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
challenge and the second one is about

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
challenge and the second one is about
power<00:00:14.759> how<00:00:15.570> about<00:00:15.960> power<00:00:16.350> consumption<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
power how about power consumption and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950 
power how about power consumption and
the<00:00:17.250> power<00:00:17.460> envelope<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.330> thing<00:00:18.630> is

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the power envelope of this thing is

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.700 
the power envelope of this thing is
between<00:00:19.529> 25<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.359> 125<00:00:21.359> watts<00:00:21.810> 448<00:00:22.500> cores

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
between 25 and 125 watts 448 cores

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.120 
between 25 and 125 watts 448 cores
though<00:00:23.550> that's<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.630> too<00:00:24.930> bad<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:26.449> we<00:00:27.449> have

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
though that's not too bad and we have

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.720 
though that's not too bad and we have
several<00:00:29.750> demonstrations<00:00:30.949> we<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.309> for

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
several demonstrations we can for

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
several demonstrations we can for
example<00:00:32.820> start<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.630> individual<00:00:34.200> workload<00:00:34.620> on

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
example start an individual workload on

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.370 
example start an individual workload on
each<00:00:34.950> core<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.000> could<00:00:36.180> also<00:00:36.329> work<00:00:36.750> combined

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
each core or we could also work combined

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.280 
each core or we could also work combined
and<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.430> brings<00:00:38.579> us<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.270> demo<00:00:39.930> screen

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and that brings us to this demo screen

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.420 
and that brings us to this demo screen
here<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> left<00:00:43.590> hand<00:00:43.770> side<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
here so on the left hand side you can

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
here so on the left hand side you can
see<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.670> performance<00:00:44.910> meter<00:00:45.510> each<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.770> these

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
see a performance meter each of these

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.510 
see a performance meter each of these
needles<00:00:47.219> shows<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.090> current<00:00:49.520> processing

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
needles shows the current processing

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
needles shows the current processing
power<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.879> each<00:00:51.360> course<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.320> really

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
power of each course so we have really

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.459 
power of each course so we have really
48<00:00:53.190> course<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> left<00:00:54.719> hand<00:00:54.930> side<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
48 course and on the left hand side you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.099 
48 course and on the left hand side you
can<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.949> cluster<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.579> course<00:00:57.109> computing

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
can see a cluster of course computing

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.020 
can see a cluster of course computing
together<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.969> 12<00:01:00.660> cores<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.170> currently

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
together so these 12 cores are currently

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
together so these 12 cores are currently
calculating<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.480> workload<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
calculating one workload and as you can

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.550 
calculating one workload and as you can
see<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> only<00:01:06.600> consumes<00:01:07.170> half<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.400> this

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
see here that only consumes half of this

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.120 
see here that only consumes half of this
performance<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.450> done<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> here

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
performance and now it's done so here

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
performance and now it's done so here
you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.729> result<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.900> manner

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
you can see the result it's a manner

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
you can see the result it's a manner
broad<00:01:16.380> set<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.250> been<00:01:17.490> calculated<00:01:19.159> by<00:01:20.159> 12

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
broad set that has been calculated by 12

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
broad set that has been calculated by 12
or<00:01:20.840> respectively<00:01:21.840> 25<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.040> 24<00:01:23.729> course<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.900> all

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
or respectively 25 for 24 course so all

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
or respectively 25 for 24 course so all
these<00:01:25.770> cores<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.460> heavily<00:01:26.729> communicating

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
these cores are heavily communicating

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
these cores are heavily communicating
with<00:01:27.689> each<00:01:27.720> other<00:01:28.549> while<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:30.390> hand

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with each other while on the right hand

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
with each other while on the right hand
side<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.200> 12<00:01:31.530> course<00:01:31.829> where<00:01:32.130> each<00:01:32.400> core

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
side you have 12 course where each core

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.200 
side you have 12 course where each core
runs<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> each<00:01:33.810> individual<00:01:34.650> workload<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> as

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
runs and each individual workload and as

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
runs and each individual workload and as
you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> screen<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.100> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you can see here on the screen I can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.780 
you can see here on the screen I can
toggle<00:01:38.729> through<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:40.020> virtual<00:01:40.259> monitors<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
toggle through the virtual monitors so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.569 
toggle through the virtual monitors so
each<00:01:42.000> core<00:01:42.299> has<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> monitor<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.259> total<00:01:43.950> there

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
each core has a monitor in total there

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.330 
each core has a monitor in total there
are<00:01:44.640> 24<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.540> them<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
are 24 of them and if I go to the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.510 
are 24 of them and if I go to the
preview<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:51.049> 24

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
preview you can now see 24

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
preview you can now see 24
course<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.719> doing<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.170> combined

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
course that are doing the combined

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.240 
course that are doing the combined
workload<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.479> 24<00:01:57.479> single<00:01:58.409> workloads<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.070> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
workload and 24 single workloads so this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
workload and 24 single workloads so this
is<00:01:59.280> really<00:02:00.920> 48<00:02:01.920> course<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.579> action<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
is really 48 course in action and if I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.180 
is really 48 course in action and if I
for<00:02:04.380> example<00:02:04.850> go<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.479> core<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.740> shows<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
for example go to this core it shows the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:21.390 
for example go to this core it shows the
video<00:02:08.539> including<00:02:09.539> sound<00:02:10.009> so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.220 

so<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.209> gives<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.720> think<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.110> good

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
so this gives I think a good

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.170 
so this gives I think a good
understanding<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.189> means<00:02:24.280> when<00:02:24.610> 48

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
understanding of what it means when 48

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.329 
understanding of what it means when 48
course<00:02:25.480> are<00:02:26.519> integrated<00:02:27.519> on<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> single<00:02:28.180> die
