great kind of smokey sort of a little

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.390 
great kind of smokey sort of a little
bit<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.670> growly<00:00:48.570> sort<00:00:49.080> of<00:00:49.230> morning<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.890> call

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
bit of a growly sort of morning I call

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.610 
bit of a growly sort of morning I call
it<00:00:50.489> morning<00:00:50.699> voice<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.269> we<00:00:51.930> found<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it morning voice and we found that a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
it morning voice and we found that a
halo<00:00:52.949> inductor<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.420> part<00:00:54.659> of<00:00:54.720> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
halo inductor which is the part of the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.479 
halo inductor which is the part of the
circuit<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> gives<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.830> kind<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> magic

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
circuit that gives it it's kind of magic

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
circuit that gives it it's kind of magic
and<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.850> bell<00:00:57.269> like<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.780> little

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and a little bell like an little

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.979 
and a little bell like an little
overtone<00:00:58.860> saturation<00:00:59.610> Distortion<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
overtone saturation Distortion it's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
overtone saturation Distortion it's
called<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> halo<00:01:01.500> inductor<00:01:02.159> from<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> 60s

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
called the halo inductor from the 60s

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870 
called the halo inductor from the 60s
that<00:01:03.900> actually<00:01:04.620> is<00:01:05.100> held<00:01:05.430> together<00:01:05.550> with<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that actually is held together with a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
that actually is held together with a
little<00:01:05.909> Mack<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.570> metal<00:01:07.290> bracket<00:01:07.620> that<00:01:08.370> looks

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
little Mack a metal bracket that looks

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
little Mack a metal bracket that looks
like<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> halo<00:01:09.150> hence<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> name<00:01:09.750> halo<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.590> we

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
like a halo hence the name halo so we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
like a halo hence the name halo so we
manufacture<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.330> spec<00:01:12.690> but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
manufacture this right to the spec but

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.290 
manufacture this right to the spec but
we<00:01:13.470> also<00:01:13.620> do<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.220> little<00:01:14.729> something<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
we also do a little little something to

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.570 
we also do a little little something to
keep<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.690> little<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:16.020> physically<00:01:16.740> stable

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
keep it a little more physically stable

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.539 
keep it a little more physically stable
so<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> doesn't<00:01:18.540> pick<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.409> Rumble<00:01:20.370> in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so it doesn't pick up as much Rumble in

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
so it doesn't pick up as much Rumble in
stage<00:01:20.820> Rumble<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.329> kicking<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.259> preserve

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
stage Rumble and kicking so we preserve

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.940 
stage Rumble and kicking so we preserve
all<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> great<00:01:23.850> harmonic<00:01:24.479> town<00:01:24.689> yet<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:25.829> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
all the great harmonic town yet kind of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
all the great harmonic town yet kind of
less<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.149> fuzzy

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
less of the fuzzy

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
less of the fuzzy
nasty<00:01:28.380> stuff<00:01:39.799> I'll<00:01:40.799> put<00:01:40.979> an<00:01:41.070> overdrive<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.670> for

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
nasty stuff I'll put an overdrive on for

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.020 
nasty stuff I'll put an overdrive on for
now

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.910 

Joe<00:01:51.030> Bonamassa<00:01:51.240> likes<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> classic<00:01:52.410> bypass

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
Joe Bonamassa likes the classic bypass

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550 
Joe Bonamassa likes the classic bypass
everybody<00:01:53.670> raises<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.450> true-bypass<00:01:54.870> so<00:01:55.350> we

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
everybody raises about true-bypass so we

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.580 
everybody raises about true-bypass so we
have<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.830> switch<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.580> does<00:01:56.760> both

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
have a switch in here that does both

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.260 
have a switch in here that does both
classic<00:01:58.590> hardwire<00:01:59.280> which<00:01:59.670> connects<00:02:00.120> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
classic hardwire which connects the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
classic hardwire which connects the
guitar<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.900> circuit<00:02:01.230> at<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.470> times

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
guitar to the circuit at all times

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.820 
guitar to the circuit at all times
rounds<00:02:02.610> off<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.880> top<00:02:03.060> end<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> little<00:02:03.510> bit

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
rounds off the top end a little bit

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.370 
rounds off the top end a little bit
almost<00:02:04.830> impersonal<00:02:05.760> but<00:02:06.260> especially<00:02:07.260> if<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
almost impersonal but especially if you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.750 
almost impersonal but especially if you
have<00:02:07.470> great<00:02:07.710> ears<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.369> used<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
have great ears and you're used to

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.850 
have great ears and you're used to
something<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.630> there<00:02:09.930> when<00:02:10.260> it's<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.560> there

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
something it's there when it's not there

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
something it's there when it's not there
it<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.220> feels<00:02:11.610> different<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:12.960> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
it just feels different but if you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.230 
it just feels different but if you
really<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.470> true<00:02:13.650> bypass<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.210> a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
really want true bypass it's got a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450 
really want true bypass it's got a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
everything off the floor and now you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.220 
everything off the floor and now you
feel<00:03:28.030> like<00:03:28.180> you're<00:03:28.329> playing<00:03:28.629> from<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.959> small

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230

so<00:03:36.000> with<00:03:36.209> those<00:03:36.390> two<00:03:36.720> features<00:03:37.379> you<00:03:37.590> really

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
so with those two features you really

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.220 
so with those two features you really
can<00:03:37.980> get<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.129> wide<00:03:38.489> breadth<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.150> overdrive<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.170> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
