was<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.960> uncanny<00:00:52.500> his<00:00:53.039> resemblance<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
was just uncanny his resemblance to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
was just uncanny his resemblance to
LeBron<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> first<00:00:55.199> realized<00:00:55.469> who<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.579> this
