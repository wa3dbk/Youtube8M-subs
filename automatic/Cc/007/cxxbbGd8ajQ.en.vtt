that<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.740> two<00:01:38.070> levels<00:01:38.520> close

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that when you have two levels close

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
that when you have two levels close
together<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.689> choose<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> lower<00:01:40.590> level

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
together you choose the lower level

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.550 
together you choose the lower level
alright<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.060> again<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.780> stock<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> falling

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
alright so again if a stock is falling

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
alright so again if a stock is falling
and<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.490> performing<00:01:44.939> stocks<00:01:45.270> where

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and it's just performing stocks where

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.249 
and it's just performing stocks where
you're<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:45.810> longer<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.170> you're

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you're going to go longer if you're

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.170 
you're going to go longer if you're
shorting<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> choose<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> higher<00:01:47.189> level<00:01:47.640> but

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
shorting you choose the higher level but

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
shorting you choose the higher level but
if<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.540> looking<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> two<00:01:49.500> levels<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
if you're looking at two levels and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.310 
if you're looking at two levels and
again<00:01:50.369> notice<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.180> second<00:01:51.840> gap<00:01:52.020> field

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
again notice this a second gap field

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.859 
again notice this a second gap field
just<00:01:52.619> below<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.790> want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> choose<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.420> lower

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
just below you want to choose the lower

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
just below you want to choose the lower
of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> two<00:01:55.350> levels<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> entry<00:01:56.549> point

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
of the two levels for the entry point

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.300 
of the two levels for the entry point
this<00:01:57.600> generally<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> hit<00:01:58.680> I'd<00:01:58.920> say<00:01:59.280> about

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
this generally will be hit I'd say about

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
this generally will be hit I'd say about
seven<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> eight<00:01:59.969> times<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.479> 10<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.750> will

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
seven to eight times out of 10 you will

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
seven to eight times out of 10 you will
hit<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> second<00:02:01.590> level<00:02:01.770> especially<00:02:02.340> when

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
hit the second level especially when

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
hit the second level especially when
it's<00:02:02.850> early<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> day<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.380> give

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
it's early in the day and that will give

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's early in the day and that will give
you<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> best<00:02:05.040> long<00:02:05.640> opportunity<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you the best long opportunity at the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.070 
you the best long opportunity at the
best<00:02:07.439> entry<00:02:08.009> price<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.300> again<00:02:09.539> notice<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
best entry price so again notice this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.190 
best entry price so again notice this
again<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.590> gap<00:02:11.220> fill<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.540> 34

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
again a gap fill on the 34

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720 
again a gap fill on the 34
thurston<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.590> go<00:02:13.739> back<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.250> 30th

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
thurston if you go back to the 30th

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.750 
thurston if you go back to the 30th
right<00:02:15.000> here<00:02:15.330> another<00:02:16.170> gap<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.250> here<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.610> their

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
right here another gap so here was their

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
right here another gap so here was their
clothes<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> 30th<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> gap<00:02:19.019> up<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
clothes on the 30th and the gap up the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.290 
clothes on the 30th and the gap up the
next<00:02:19.500> day<00:02:19.590> here's<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.250> clothes<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> 31st

next day here's your clothes on the 31st

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.290 
next day here's your clothes on the 31st
and<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.870> gap<00:02:22.080> up<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.920> next<00:02:23.160> day<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.209> this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and the gap up the next day so in this

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.360 
and the gap up the next day so in this
situation<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.530> two<00:02:25.769> levels<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.280> are

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
situation you have two levels that are

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.430 
situation you have two levels that are
very<00:02:26.610> close<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.060> each<00:02:27.120> other<00:02:27.360> choose<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
very close to each other choose the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.500 
very close to each other choose the
lower<00:02:28.739> gap<00:02:29.160> fill<00:02:29.519> because<00:02:29.670> ultimately<00:02:30.120> what

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
lower gap fill because ultimately what

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
lower gap fill because ultimately what
you'll<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.930> you'll<00:02:30.959> stall<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:31.860> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you'll do is you'll stall here and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.550 
you'll do is you'll stall here and
you'll<00:02:32.459> pierce<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.120> first<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.660> tagging<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
you'll pierce the first one tagging the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
you'll pierce the first one tagging the
second<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.310> that's<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.760> reversal<00:02:36.300> point

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
second one and that's the reversal point

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.750 
second one and that's the reversal point
ok<00:02:37.620> guys<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.069> again<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.519> look<00:02:38.730> very

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
closely on the SP why it sold off right

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.589 
closely on the SP why it sold off right
into<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> 1030<00:02:43.379> time<00:02:43.650> frame<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.599> exactly

into the 1030 time frame and exactly
right<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.019> can<00:02:46.140> see<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> lower<00:02:46.590> level

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
right there you can see the lower level

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.610 
right there you can see the lower level
it<00:02:47.099> pierced<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.730> reversed<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.260> was<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620

skip and a jump up and then retrace to
the<00:02:53.459> first<00:02:53.700> line<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.239> then<00:02:54.599> up<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.930> away<00:02:55.140> we

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
the first line and then up and away we

addition you get a bottoming tail in
addition<00:04:32.580> as<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.880> third<00:04:33.210> factor<00:04:33.570> which<00:04:33.690> was

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
addition as a third factor which was

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.810 
addition as a third factor which was
also<00:04:34.110> on<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.290> spiders<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:35.070> was<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.340> 1030

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
also on the spiders it was the 1030

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.120 
also on the spiders it was the 1030

to<00:04:44.790> float<00:04:45.030> up<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.780> lot<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.020> members<00:04:46.290> also

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
to float up so a lot of members also

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.100 
to float up so a lot of members also
made<00:04:46.890> some<00:04:47.070> good<00:04:47.190> money<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.730> one<00:04:48.110> lastly

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
made some good money on this one lastly

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.990 
made some good money on this one lastly
we<00:04:49.260> can<00:04:49.380> take<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> look<00:04:49.710> at<00:04:49.800> JPM<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.460> because

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
we can take a look at JPM and because

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.220 
we can take a look at JPM and because
Goldman<00:04:51.360> bounced<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.720> could<00:04:51.840> generally

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
Goldman bounced you could generally

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.830 
Goldman bounced you could generally
assume<00:04:52.560> JPM<00:04:53.340> would<00:04:53.520> bounce<00:04:53.700> JPM<00:04:54.510> is<00:04:54.600> one<00:04:54.750> of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
assume JPM would bounce JPM is one of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.510 
assume JPM would bounce JPM is one of
the<00:04:54.900> traits<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.200> didn't<00:04:55.560> take<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.890> took<00:04:55.980> Goldman

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
the traits I didn't take I took Goldman

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.550 
the traits I didn't take I took Goldman
and<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:56.730> also<00:04:56.880> took<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.150> S&amp;P<00:04:57.540> 500<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.110> SP<00:04:58.410> why

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
and I also took the S&amp;P 500 the SP why

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.530 
and I also took the S&amp;P 500 the SP why
but<00:04:59.070> because<00:04:59.370> boldmann<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.060> JPM<00:05:00.420> are

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
but because boldmann and JPM are

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.880 
but because boldmann and JPM are
basically<00:05:00.870> both<00:05:01.050> financial<00:05:01.530> stocks<00:05:01.650> there's

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
basically both financial stocks there's

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.260 
basically both financial stocks there's
really<00:05:02.010> no<00:05:02.220> reason<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.580> play<00:05:02.700> both<00:05:02.940> of<00:05:03.000> them

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
really no reason to play both of them

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.660 
really no reason to play both of them
but<00:05:03.690> what<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.930> can<00:05:04.080> see<00:05:04.260> here<00:05:04.290> on<00:05:04.530> JPM<00:05:05.070> is<00:05:05.280> the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
but what you can see here on JPM is the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.340 
but what you can see here on JPM is the
same<00:05:05.910> factor<00:05:06.450> all<00:05:06.870> right<00:05:07.020> look<00:05:07.140> at<00:05:07.260> this

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
same factor all right look at this

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.380 
same factor all right look at this
bottoming<00:05:07.950> tail<00:05:08.160> right<00:05:08.430> here<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:08.940> then<00:05:09.300> you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
bottoming tail right here and then you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.300 
bottoming tail right here and then you
want<00:05:09.600> that<00:05:09.750> secondary<00:05:10.200> factor<00:05:10.740> by<00:05:10.890> zooming

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
want that secondary factor by zooming

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.460 
want that secondary factor by zooming
out<00:05:11.430> which<00:05:12.060> again<00:05:12.360> comes<00:05:12.750> into<00:05:13.050> this<00:05:13.200> little

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
out which again comes into this little

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.700 
out which again comes into this little
pivot<00:05:13.830> low<00:05:14.010> right<00:05:14.790> here<00:05:15.150> around<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.780> 5480

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
pivot low right here around the 5480

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.860 
pivot low right here around the 5480
level<00:05:17.190> take<00:05:17.730> that<00:05:17.910> trend<00:05:18.180> line<00:05:18.360> draw<00:05:18.570> right

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
level take that trend line draw right

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.320 
level take that trend line draw right
across<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.950> get<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.160> major<00:05:20.490> blow<00:05:21.120> right

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
across and you get a major blow right

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.660 
across and you get a major blow right
there<00:05:21.660> with<00:05:22.230> a<00:05:22.260> bottoming<00:05:22.770> tail<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:23.250> look<00:05:23.580> at

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
there with a bottoming tail and look at

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.890 
there with a bottoming tail and look at
the<00:05:23.760> move<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.240> upside<00:05:24.390> now<00:05:24.750> you're

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
the move to the upside now you're

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.180 
the move to the upside now you're
pulling<00:05:25.140> back<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.320> little<00:05:25.530> bit<00:05:25.680> but<00:05:25.800> again<00:05:26.010> as<00:05:26.160> a
