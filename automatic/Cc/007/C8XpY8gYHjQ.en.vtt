00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 in this video we will see how caviar the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.110
 our duvet cover then first 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:17.810
 what we place the most wine and also the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:20.039
 we tie duvet cover is 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.519
 probable rotary movement of the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.539
 arms let's find the two 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.460
 ok these extreme angles here once 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.489
 that we found them position us in 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 this way if we start to insert ourselves 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.520
 inside the duvet we take the corner of the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.350
 down jacket and we put it in our first one 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.219
 angle 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 ok so this way after what 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.440
 let's follow follow as I said follow 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.239
 the seam except at the top and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.899
 we continue to insert the duvet 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.770
 helping us with mini seam we continue 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.799
 to keep more wine and seam and teach 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.630
 until we reach each other 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.330
 the opposite corner wrote that more or less 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.210
 everything will have been entered now 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.950
 population 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.229
 so once it's the part 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.710
 superior was all that entered 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.750
 I take all the down and I turn it around 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.530
 also because this side will be what 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:37.509
 you will go to the head of the bed 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:43.920
 so I turn it over and fix it and then no 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.920
 big unroll and bring it up down 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:58.180
 don't go well you do it 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:02.020
 in the laterals make a good shot fall 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.869
 here it is more or less practically 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:12.630
 inserted assures the side 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:12.630
 underlying so and so 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:23.580
 that's it i finished the bed is 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.580
 done completely
