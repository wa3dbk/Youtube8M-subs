the Sharabi the powerful zero me
apparently<00:00:51.180> there's<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> reason<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:51.719> mega

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
apparently there's a reason why mega

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.389 
apparently there's a reason why mega
Rayquaza<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> mega<00:00:52.860> evolution<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
Rayquaza is a mega evolution not a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.160 
Rayquaza is a mega evolution not a
primal<00:00:53.760> reversion<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.480> apparently<00:00:55.020> it's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
primal reversion and apparently it's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.799 
primal reversion and apparently it's
explained<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> story<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.129> well<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.690> will

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809

also<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.289> evolve<00:00:58.710> through<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> different<00:00:59.370> way

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
also make evolve through a different way

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
also make evolve through a different way
than<00:00:59.670> normal<00:00:59.699> Pokemon<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> course<00:01:01.140> mega

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
than normal Pokemon and of course mega
