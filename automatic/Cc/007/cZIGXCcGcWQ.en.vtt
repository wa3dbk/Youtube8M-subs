00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.880
 of bureaucracy in relation to displacement 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.530
 marketing of ornamental trees 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.240
 the state is very expressive July is 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.149
 dedicates to the creation of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 parakeets are more than 100 animals 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.460

 practically six or seven 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.680
 years to meet most of the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.170
 cuiabá and my father my target audience are 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.440
 the stores that later pass on the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.810
 and is satisfactory 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.780
 gives a legal income that needs 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.489
 giving a good feedback is a very 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.190
 Pleasant I feel very good creating 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.140
 these animals because they do not give off 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.620
 much of your time you always have a 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.540
 series of other activities the calopsita is 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 one of the most sought after birds 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.860
 especially for those who have children in 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.140
 and the process of domestication for 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.959
 make it more docile quieter 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.750
 stuffed starts from the moment 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.269
 you will feed them starts this 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.489
 adaptation we will see is actually the 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.100
 process begins by feeding people 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.500
 withdraws from the mother of the line 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.760
 in this first phase until its twentieth 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.980
 more or less life day 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.170
 she is fed by the father by the mother with 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.110
 lines that we offer 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.100
 some balanced rations that the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.110
 people use 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.360
 after that first moment people 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.850
 assumes her creation as if you 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.010
 adopt if she as a child even this 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.680
 bird type is ideal for those who live 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.380
 in apartment and company search it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.930
 usually survive from eight to ten years 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.880
 care is simple enough to ensure 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.870
 a balanced diet based on 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.299
 seeds 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 the water should be filtered and the place where 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.370
 inhabits airy great care 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.620
 dedicated a domestic accident is 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.280
 that visit is very interactive to 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.690
 Sometimes you come home and she sees you. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.060
 it behaves similarly to the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.350
 the dog jumps out of the cage and 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.329
 walking behind you 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.970
 we have had cases where people 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.120
 that they used the person because they still 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.490
 ran after the person the person passed 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.260
 with the car on it 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.160
 So these are situations that we have to 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.160
 seek to care
