00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 um 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello guys and girls from youtube me 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.929
 I have a mini tutorial 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.599
 quickie of the mod lost month 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 xl for the version of minecraft 1.7 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.349
 point 10 and earlier of the mod and good 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 tell you that this is a mod that 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.189
 we will add a lot of variants 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 for our biomes as its name 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.150
 Exactly from minecraft 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 I think we're in 73 new improvements 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.949
 for our minecraft biomes this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 does not mean that there are 73 biomes but that 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.150
 there are 73 variants that are going to be added to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.129
 our minecraft biomes for example 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.190
 then trees colored trees more 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.839
 large plants etc etc. never 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.549
 will add anything that we did not have 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.680
 in minecraft but the truth is that it is 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.720
 quite pretty good because it gives that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 realistic tone to our worlds of 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.890
 Minecraft is worth separate if it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.010
 mixtures with sanders because the truth is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 that is a fantastic world good 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.439
 previously it is valid when you who 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.239
 you had a world you had to go here to 

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.640
 more options in the world and here the world 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.960
 because you had to change this because 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.630
 that you would like now 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.360
 now you can give it a default value and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.820
 to notice when we create a new world on 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.580
 world in question will have been generated with 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.800
 these variants, well, you are going to see that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
 going to pull for example as how are you doing 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.200
 happening to me some bond that another one is worth 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 because what it does is overwrite the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.490
 biomes that is worth as you can see me 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 is striking a considerable bond but 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.320
 well this once it's finished it's worth it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 new trees are being seen 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.390
 so on and so once you finish and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640
 it's not going to be badly needed and we're not going to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
 have these pulls of the principle of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 generation of the world you already know that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 you when you are going to generate world 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.500
 It is worth when you have reached the limit of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
 world generated then you stick these 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.840
 jerks is worth the truth is that I 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850
 is hitting quite a pull is worth now 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.229
 now now now now it's worth 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.539
 I want to get this tree to that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.270
 you see fixes has the truth is that 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.610
 has pretty pretty interesting things 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.910
 interesting, as you can see, but 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.080
 well really everything we will have if 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 you have installed in it and you are going to have it 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.190
 all the plants all the seeds 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.380
 all the leaves and so on and so on and a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.430
 couple of little things more than you're going to have 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.079
 here that already 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.620
 basically for simple fact of good 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.900
 Well, curiosity, for example, is not 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.560
 we have eustachian eustachian here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.840
 Welcome 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.719
 eustaquio let's make a warehouse of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.090
 eustachian would be such that this is worth 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.219
 it would be a ready eustachian warehouse 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.930
 so killer sheep like that of 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.609
 there and they move hosts I did not know that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.370
 they moved mica the mother who gave birth 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:50.790
 It's worth it so cool pretty cool already 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.560
 You see the ties that are striking me 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.109
 because he is trying to generate 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.459
 everyone possible this is something that 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.169
 At the beginning it will happen to you to arrive a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.629
 moment that stabilizes good because 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.889
 you know that there are always improvements of these 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.450
 mods and the truth is that in this version 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.879
 of the 17 10 since I've seen that there is a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.200
 little bit of pull but not good 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.750
 it's really cool 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.209
 pretty cool I recommend it and nothing 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280
 we go with the installation welcome in 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.469
 the installation of misplacement months xl for 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.150
 the version of minecraft 1.7 10 and 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.200

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.900
 good as we've seen in the video 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.390
 above is in a way that we 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.599
 adds a lot of biomes of the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.310

 for the correct installation of the mod 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.080
 you are going to have to need minecraft 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.540

 correctly step by step for the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.040
 installation of the 1 710 correct good 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.540
 once done this we are going to download 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.400

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.169
 and this is the version of the good way we 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.330
 we go to our minecraft folder and 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.180
 we make sure that we have our 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.530
 force installed correct well good and what 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.300
 explained many times so we're going to 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.830
 go a little faster and we're going to 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.800
 create the mods folder and this is where 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.690
 we will copy both the mod voucher and 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.539
 you want the no of the items and so on 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.740
 issue of character or story no longer 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.930
 you know what 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.210
 there are no characters there is nothing that can 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.729
 add this mod you're basically going to have 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.190
 that interface that we've seen so what 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.599
 only you will have to hit and put 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.759
 it will be the profile 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.440
 automatically fine is the profile of a 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.990
 record but I have this other profile of 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.520
 forum if you come out only the 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.099
 of your name then put here what 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.620
 that is worth and here below where he puts 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.440
 use version 17 10 if you download below the 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.560
 anything goes with this you will have the version 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.930
 de force installed that you had worth it 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.940
 we would give to save correct profile and 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.949
 selection we would make the wrong profile this is 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.720
 very important this part is worth you have 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.630
 to select the profile so that 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.789
 change to this here it's worth once done 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.099
 you give him to play and we check that 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.389
 we have the mod installed perfectly 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.860
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.360
