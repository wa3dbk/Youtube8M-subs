00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.430

 on it costs 7 euro 990 the good piece 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 and yes as I said the brand new star 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.480

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.379
 Music edition of the man with a pair of scissors 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.379
 to open the whole 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.160
 that's what we're all about 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 the same comes out no way off 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.080
 then we have the limited edition here 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.360
 pads card and of course a booster 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.799
 then we have the official one here 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.930
 sammler magazin what so far synonymous 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.509
 always exposed as a giant poster 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 At least the picture was at the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.100
 last time so and here it is 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.159
 again these giants yes i say now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.159
 Now look at the genealogical tree 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:38.189
 the force attack series 3 that suits everything 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 not at all on the picture so here 's 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.909
 again explanation to some cards 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.840
 take for example here obi wan kenobi 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.850
 101 101 card number 230 help more obi 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 wan kenobi you are my last one 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.490
 hope 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.920
 do not worry about the unbeatable value 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 from defending 101 at attacks 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 nobody against this idea 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.829
 he is the ultimate map of the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.799
 So be warned if you have a collection 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.129
 attacks, he will become more powerful than 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.869
 you imagine it even remotely 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.180
 can 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 yes, here you can do it too 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.610
 to make extra video about this whole 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.930
 There is a lot of cards in this 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.360
 collector magazine 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.090
 who is interested in me , I would too 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.470
 otherwise like a special video again 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.569
 Write to me the comments 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.569
 if you have an extra video on these 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.920
 Collector magazine I want to see there 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.629
 then make an extra video 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.500
 as I said, that writes in the 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.780
 comments would be of interest to me 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.370
 who cares so then there is 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.760
 the cover will be collected here 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.829
 here again the checklist 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.650
 with the cards that's a bit more stable 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.989
 paper and then here's that 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.120
 Spielfeld, too, is huge again 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.150
 I would say so big away half as big 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.109
 like the poster you can see almost everything 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.970
 So you have to go there 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.250
 difficult to read through exactly who 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.269
 So this star was actually playing 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.269
 wants to play 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.780
 as I said it I had to stop with times 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.370
 to deal with the rules of the game 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.799
 Then we have the collection folder here 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.760
 even that looks just alright so here 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.829
 even that kerner much behind again 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.389
 a bit of advertising to print me now 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:29.900
 at top sprinter rank two 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.340
 limited editions but here you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.810
 you are a great star wars fan and you are dreaming 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.549
 of it once for the dark side 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.019
 the power to fight then afterwards 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.699
 the first step with it despite 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.430
 print me even if the tops direct de 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.190
 you can create your own vortex card 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.000
 put 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.030
 I'm going to maybe another 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.129
 and look at the collection folder then 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.019
 I lay huge and we say 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.019
 Once you have to do it yourself 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.750
 push so to speak could hold so once 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.370
 this is it I think the same 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.579
 Appeal as always as well as at 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.699
 match attax or both types excel series 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.819
 it is always the same 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:17.419
 I would now have a collection folder 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.859
 so at least just pretend 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.820
 that one stops in front and behind 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.820
 other color line 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.970
 so 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.220
 Carefully do not push that in here 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.970
 something does not sec or breaks that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:44.520
 It would be annoying that is what it looks like 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.710
 very nice yes and now we still have 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.190
 here a booster and a limited 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.790
 pad namely luke skywalker with the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.650
 card number l1 limited edition and 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.860

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.260
 Laser cannon as often as it is the alliance 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.510
 pharma yes who would have thought that before 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.710
 luke skywalker for jedi was he 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.770
 stop simple boy defense 95 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.610
 attack strength 92 and then we have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.200

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.080

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.560
