00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
other people on stage but I tend to

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.500 
other people on stage but I tend to
approach<00:03:55.580> Allmusic<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.700> same<00:03:56.910> way<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.390> way<00:03:57.480> I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
approach Allmusic the same way the way I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.030 
approach Allmusic the same way the way I
look<00:03:57.720> at<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.959> there<00:03:58.110> are<00:03:58.200> 12<00:03:58.440> different<00:03:58.709> notes

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
look at it there are 12 different notes

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.970 
look at it there are 12 different notes
in<00:03:59.420> Western<00:04:00.420> music<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:01.709> should<00:04:01.890> learn

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
in Western music and so we should learn

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.560 
in Western music and so we should learn
to<00:04:02.040> play<00:04:02.280> them<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.760> as<00:04:03.060> many<00:04:03.090> different<00:04:03.390> ways

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
to play them in as many different ways

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.479 
to play them in as many different ways
as<00:04:03.840> possible<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.500> try<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.739> keep<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.100> simple

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
as possible so I try to keep it simple

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.800 
as possible so I try to keep it simple
and<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.790> makes<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.120> lot<00:04:06.239> easier<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.720> more

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
and that makes it a lot easier and more

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:26.990 
and that makes it a lot easier and more
fun<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.140> play

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
