00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.630
 Good staff here is a good option for 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 Who likes a good fishery? 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.599
 there is a four-meter boat and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 half length 1 meter and twenty 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.789
 five wide in the middle 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.150
 here is the engine mount 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.769
 a boat that can put a motor up to 15 hp 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 then there is this bank is a type bank 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.690
 that this case 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:42.890
 this overturned boat will not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:57.949
 sink in any way . 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:57.949
 none on electric that allows you 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.220
 can row quietly down 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.740
 that allow you to both use 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.439
 motor as in the tail or in the rowing here 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 we have to live with you to put 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:30.840
 feet on which the movement of the boat 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.770
 Water 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.470
 the boat in the water and he in height has more 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.299
 or less half 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.899
 you can however live the same fish 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:54.229
 that will not bother you inside the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:02:11.099
 boat or even spoiling the object 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:13.050
 put the cell phone can not look 4 not 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.860
 means to be four people to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.380
 load it 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.290
 two people just enough take one 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.360
 here in this front hand grip in the case of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.440
 right side another backside 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.450
 left 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.160
 and remember it is celebrated boat do not want 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.900
 because it is a very light one boat 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.270
 boat that weighs around 70 kilos 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.510
 two people take you wherever you want 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.900
 hit the carriage of it as much as you do 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.420
 transporting alencar retained within or around 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.840
 of a van on top of the truck with the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.450
 charge would be and 45 meters or even 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.890
 on top of an expensive rack the popular it 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.320
 go quietly 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.630
 due to its weight is just put it 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.570
 tied up and face down so you 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.280
 take him wherever you want any 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:02.670
 car there the whole little boat made of fiber 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.640
 and with great price including much more in 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.310
 account than aluminum boats 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.070
 in the case of the wooden boat becomes well 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.739
 cheaper than this fiber boat is just 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.450
 has one but not one third of the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.220
 durability of this boat 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.310
 This is what I can give you here. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.959
 around 5 years warranty 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 because I know it manufactures more than ten 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.730
 years these boats and a very good boat 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 that has no way of giving problem 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.489
 fiber for many people seems to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.709
 she is fragile she knows and box of water and 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.410
 other other parts made in 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.370
 fiber and think that the same boat 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.970
 weak and fragile but I do not have 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.670
 certainty that you can quietly quoted 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.470
 hit something on a stone and it will not 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.959
 to break you break a boat itself 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.470
 only if you knock down and even if the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.590
 finish of the height of 34 meters there 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.480
 comes to break and even damage 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.190
 break 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.920
 even if you have to break it a lot 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.290
 easy to repair differently from the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.230
 wooden or aluminum boat 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.829
 let's suppose that it ends up causing a 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.019
 accident was to start until 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.709
 even a piece of the boat's bottom 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.840
 boat 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.690
 so even if you pull a piece of the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.729
 bone down here and filled with water 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.729
 the other parts other compartments 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.570
 walking the same way will not have 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.560
 danger of sinking the drowning 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.580
 onwards 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.320
 so it's there the boat leaves your 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.510
 comment below 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.190
 if you need to know the price there 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.300
 some other information 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.300
 we'll be passing
