00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
accidentally shot something down here to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.690 
accidentally shot something down here to
the<00:01:47.909> south<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.479> nest<00:01:49.079> number<00:01:49.530> three<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.280> shoot

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the south is nest number three so shoot

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
the south is nest number three so shoot
that<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.290> over<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that one there and then just over to the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
that one there and then just over to the
northeast<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.790> no<00:01:54.119> look<00:01:54.540> away

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
northeast not that one no look away
nothing<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.680> see<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:55.860> keep<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.340> around

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
nothing to see here keep going around

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550 
nothing to see here keep going around
there<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.810> go

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
there we go

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.240 
there we go
there<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.280> nest<00:01:59.759> number<00:02:00.420> four<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.140> blue<00:02:01.710> room<00:02:01.920> so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
there is nest number four a blue room so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.190 
there is nest number four a blue room so
you've<00:02:02.369> got<00:02:02.520> three<00:02:02.759> nests<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.899> point

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you've got three nests from that point

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.249 
you've got three nests from that point
there<00:02:04.619> we're<00:02:05.340> gonna<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.610> snag<00:02:06.060> nest<00:02:06.600> number

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
there we're gonna go snag nest number

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
there we're gonna go snag nest number
five<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.950> didn't<00:02:08.280> really<00:02:08.489> work<00:02:08.759> out

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
five now and I didn't really work out

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.279 
five now and I didn't really work out
what<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> thing<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.720> guessing<00:02:10.020> it'll<00:02:10.140> be

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
what that thing is I'm guessing it'll be

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.530 
what that thing is I'm guessing it'll be
part<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:11.039> mission

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
part of a mission

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.599 
part of a mission
later<00:02:12.439> Butthead<00:02:13.189> down<00:02:13.489> south<00:02:13.879> here<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:16.010> you

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
later Butthead down south here and you

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.209 
later Butthead down south here and you
will<00:02:16.760> find<00:02:16.819> nest<00:02:17.629> number<00:02:18.260> 5<00:02:18.620> first<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.129> all

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
will find nest number 5 first of all

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.610 
will find nest number 5 first of all
though<00:02:19.340> we're<00:02:19.519> gonna<00:02:19.609> get<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.599> claptrap<00:02:20.989> one

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
though we're gonna get the claptrap one

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.160 
though we're gonna get the claptrap one
and<00:02:22.579> that<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.909> off<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.090> air<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.659> southwest

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
and that is off the air to the southwest

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.809 
and that is off the air to the southwest
I'm<00:02:24.349> gonna<00:02:24.500> grab<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.739> boat<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.459> because<00:02:25.700> it's

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
I'm gonna grab a boat just because it's

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.309 
I'm gonna grab a boat just because it's

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
gonna make traveling a bit quicker in

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.539 
gonna make traveling a bit quicker in
the<00:02:27.469> future<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.040> obviously<00:02:28.310> I've<00:02:28.400> got<00:02:28.519> a

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
the future and obviously I've got a

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.789 
the future and obviously I've got a

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
to head west from the boat pickup and

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.319 
to head west from the boat pickup and
you'll<00:02:33.620> find<00:02:34.129> some<00:02:34.370> stumps<00:02:34.760> which<00:02:35.000> won't<00:02:35.180> let

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
you'll find some stumps which won't let

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.520 
you'll find some stumps which won't let
you<00:02:35.390> take<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.629> boat<00:02:35.750> any<00:02:35.930> further<00:02:36.079> head<00:02:36.349> down

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
you take the boat any further head down

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.399 
you take the boat any further head down
here<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.920> might<00:02:37.099> find<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:38.109> scallion<00:02:39.109> or<00:02:39.230> two

it's<00:02:58.819> a<00:02:58.909> shame<00:02:59.120> claptrap<00:02:59.659> doesn't<00:02:59.989> chime<00:03:00.260> in

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
it's a shame claptrap doesn't chime in

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.250 
it's a shame claptrap doesn't chime in
with<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.560> comment<00:03:00.829> but<00:03:01.189> what<00:03:01.430> can<00:03:01.609> you<00:03:01.700> do

kind of still not liking the hop about
much<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:18.889> still<00:03:18.949> quicker<00:03:19.250> than<00:03:19.400> walking

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
much but it's still quicker than walking
