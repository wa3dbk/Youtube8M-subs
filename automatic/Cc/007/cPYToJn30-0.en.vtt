00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.019
 Hello everyone, I am able to read more the suspect to give the Petrobras fish 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.060
 symphonic 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.140
 I'm here today this Sunday. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.419
 what could be one of the concerts like any other 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.529
 but there's something special 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.529
 People today start a project that is the sider. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 I know it's the koff fable 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.490
 is offered by the symphonic doing precisely the opposite movement what 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.940
 we see today in the concert hall 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 until the moment to encourage with the youth 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.450
 on the one hand a de facto thing of the person because the sea 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 then park 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700
 iturbe our right 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.790
 the fact of the person using the cell phone in the concert hall brings the climbers 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.600
 will say 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.730
 5 say that the repair is good to make a disclosure of the repair 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 but it was always a very suppressed thing instead of the advent of the cell phone we come 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 doing momentum meeting we found 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.210
 dci first leaves conciliator we will present 3 with seven brandenburg 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.440
 it stands to reason that the code vants a correction of 6% 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.880
 dedicated to the PÃ©rez continent 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.680
 on Sunday this year's move 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.040
 in fact at that time there were no masterpieces yet that work 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.460
 ended up being forgotten in the identical little library where 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.650
 this was 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.390
 yasuko brewed around 1850 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.910
 the repertoire quite the deputies 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.310
 by knicks to others in the world 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.219
 I hope you enjoy the PT. He highlighted that part of the plan participates 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.929
 It's always a pleasure. 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.929
 the sector 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.019
 I think i did well 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.949
 music 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.869
 I do not ask our spirit 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:30.489
 it's not only there we're hopeless in the second half 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.099
 disabled today 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.379
 but unfortunately activities 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.650
 is in ours this way explains these people 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.439
 they had the highest falls 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.199
 in the next day 14 the municipality of colÃ­der soybean oil 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:57.749

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.929
 the wife and two children 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.929
 gilberto gil in operation for three weeks 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 happy Birthday to You 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.020
 any twitter gift on facebook 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.479
 on orkut 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.050
 it certainly keeps us in the tradition of side without leaving in front of 11 of 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.779
 September 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.819
 so the creation of the first Brazilian offer starts with rain 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.770
 we want to leave it registered here 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.219
