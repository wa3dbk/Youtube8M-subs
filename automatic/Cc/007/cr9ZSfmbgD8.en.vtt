00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and you can tell that they put a lot of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.290 
and you can tell that they put a lot of
work<00:00:40.950> into<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
work into this because you know this is

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.490 
work into this because you know this is
probably<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> heist<00:00:43.140> spots

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

I'm gonna show you guys how to get on
the<00:00:46.500> outside<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> do

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the outside if you don't know how to do

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.910 
the outside if you don't know how to do
that<00:00:47.579> already<00:00:47.780> most<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> probably<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.739> but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that already most of you probably do but

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.110 
that already most of you probably do but
just<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.219> case<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> go

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just in case you don't you have to go

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
just in case you don't you have to go
through<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.480> door<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.980> these

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
through this door and you to go up these

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
through this door and you to go up these
stairs<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> there's<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.870> much<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
stairs and there's pretty much just a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
stairs and there's pretty much just a
pathway<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> balcony<00:00:56.280> pathway<00:00:56.850> type<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pathway like a balcony pathway type of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
pathway like a balcony pathway type of
thing<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.170> tell<00:00:58.469> by<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.920> look<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
thing as you can tell by I look over to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.950 
thing as you can tell by I look over to
the<00:00:59.430> left<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> downstairs

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the left here you can see the downstairs

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
the left here you can see the downstairs
floor<00:01:01.170> where<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> I'm

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
floor where I just was at and I'm

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.729 
floor where I just was at and I'm
actually<00:01:03.210> guys<00:01:03.449> how<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.199> voltage

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
actually guys how to get to the voltage

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.190 
actually guys how to get to the voltage
because<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> gate<00:01:05.460> itself<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.119> closed<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
because the gate itself is closed but

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
because the gate itself is closed but
there<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> small<00:01:08.250> little<00:01:08.430> glitch<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
there is a small little glitch that you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.640 
there is a small little glitch that you
can<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.810> pretty<00:01:10.020> hard<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.500> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
can do it's pretty hard to do if I can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.219 
can do it's pretty hard to do if I can
get<00:01:10.770> through<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> door<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.630> pretty<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
get through the door this is pretty it's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
get through the door this is pretty it's
pretty<00:01:13.409> hard<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.890> easy<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
pretty hard pretty easy to do if you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
pretty hard pretty easy to do if you
know<00:01:15.060> how<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.540> easy<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> can

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
know how to do it is easy but as you can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
know how to do it is easy but as you can
tell<00:01:17.070> behind<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.420> tellers<00:01:19.080> windows<00:01:19.409> now

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
tell behind the the tellers windows now

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.030 
tell behind the the tellers windows now
where<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> workers<00:01:20.939> would<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
where all the workers would be at and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
ways that you can get in one is easier

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.520

than<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.489> other<00:02:38.609> other<00:02:39.269> way<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.260> can

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
than the other other way now you can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.920 
than the other other way now you can
kick<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.920> vault<00:02:41.129> open<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.579> um<00:02:42.060> it's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
kick the vault open like that um it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.149 
kick the vault open like that um it's
kind<00:02:43.139> of<00:02:43.170> hard<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.379> do<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.590> though<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:43.829> if

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
kind of hard to do it though because if

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.349 
kind of hard to do it though because if
your<00:02:44.250> guy<00:02:44.340> does<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.849> he's<00:02:44.939> too<00:02:45.090> close<00:02:45.299> so

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
your guy does it and he's too close so

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.110 
your guy does it and he's too close so
he<00:02:45.569> goes<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.810> back<00:02:45.959> off<00:02:46.139> in<00:02:46.319> time<00:02:46.530> um<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.639> bank

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
he goes in back off in time um the bank

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.670
