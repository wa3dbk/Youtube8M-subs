welcome<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.040> flow<00:00:39.489> sessions<00:00:40.150> in<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:41.050> glue

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
welcome to flow sessions in this glue

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.490 
welcome to flow sessions in this glue
session<00:00:41.890> we<00:00:42.100> are<00:00:42.129> going<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.730> weave<00:00:43.000> together

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
session we are going to weave together

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.760 
session we are going to weave together
mandela's<00:00:44.500> weaves<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.820> 360<00:00:46.450> weave<00:00:46.930> the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
mandela's weaves and the 360 weave the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.860 
mandela's weaves and the 360 weave the
idea<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.309> flow<00:00:48.580> sessions<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.270> that<00:00:49.390> we<00:00:49.570> work

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
idea of flow sessions is that we work

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.260 
idea of flow sessions is that we work
together<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:51.070> move<00:00:51.309> through<00:00:51.670> tricks<00:00:52.030> and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
together to move through tricks and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.360 
together to move through tricks and
transitions<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.290> we<00:00:53.379> can<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:53.860> Rock<00:00:54.129> a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
transitions so that we can really Rock a

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.689 
transitions so that we can really Rock a
few<00:00:54.610> days<00:00:54.850> flow<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:56.230> let's<00:00:56.650> break<00:00:56.890> down<00:00:56.920> that

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
few days flow so let's break down that

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.570 
few days flow so let's break down that
choreo<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:59.290> let's<00:00:59.440> see<00:00:59.589> how<00:00:59.739> we<00:00:59.769> go<00:01:00.040> grab<00:01:00.430> your

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
choreo and let's see how we go grab your

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.079 
choreo and let's see how we go grab your
hoop

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
hoop

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.259 
hoop
let's<00:01:02.080> kick<00:01:02.350> start<00:01:02.680> with<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.949> side<00:01:03.309> we<00:01:03.699> wear<00:01:04.150> the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
let's kick start with a side we wear the

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.030 
let's kick start with a side we wear the
hoop<00:01:04.479> falls<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> front<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.010> back

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
hoop falls in the front and the back

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.480 
hoop falls in the front and the back
clean<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.000> elbow<00:01:07.479> is<00:01:07.780> out<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.440> decide<00:01:08.830> in

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
clean so the elbow is out to decide in

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.730 
clean so the elbow is out to decide in
line<00:01:10.030> with<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.420> shoulder<00:01:10.870> we're<00:01:11.229> letting<00:01:11.620> the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
line with the shoulder we're letting the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.460 
line with the shoulder we're letting the
hoop<00:01:11.979> or<00:01:12.220> allowing<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.120> hoops<00:01:13.390> weight<00:01:13.840> to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
hoop or allowing the hoops weight to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.460 
hoop or allowing the hoops weight to
fall<00:01:14.800> into<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.550> plane<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.870> with<00:01:17.290> these

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
fall into that plane so with these

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.210 
fall into that plane so with these
weaves<00:01:17.920> if<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:19.150> are<00:01:19.390> your<00:01:20.080> left<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.010> right

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
weaves if you are your left and right

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.670 
weaves if you are your left and right
side<00:01:21.610> weave<00:01:21.940> then<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> elbow<00:01:22.990> will<00:01:23.200> be<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
side weave then the elbow will be in the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.740 
side weave then the elbow will be in the
front<00:01:23.979> body<00:01:24.220> but<00:01:24.700> if<00:01:24.790> you're<00:01:24.970> doing<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.330> front

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
front body but if you're doing the front

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.500 
front body but if you're doing the front
and<00:01:26.020> back<00:01:26.350> or<00:01:26.710> side<00:01:26.979> weave<00:01:27.370> they<00:01:27.970> new<00:01:28.120> elbow

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
and back or side weave they new elbow

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.149 
and back or side weave they new elbow
will<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:28.840> out<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.380> side<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.770> that's<00:01:29.920> going

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
will be out to the side and that's going

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.310 
will be out to the side and that's going
to<00:01:30.219> make<00:01:30.369> all<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.640> difference<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.899> after<00:01:32.289> a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
to make all the difference so after a

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.590 
to make all the difference so after a
few<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.740> these<00:01:32.920> when<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.579> hoop<00:01:33.759> swings<00:01:34.270> in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
few of these when the hoop swings in

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.270 
few of these when the hoop swings in
your<00:01:34.750> front<00:01:35.079> plane<00:01:35.409> you're<00:01:35.920> going<00:01:36.159> to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
your front plane you're going to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.399 
your front plane you're going to
continue<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.000> swing<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.570> do<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:38.079> kind<00:01:38.350> of

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
continue the swing and do this kind of

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.980 
continue the swing and do this kind of
fake<00:01:38.740> stall<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.030> other<00:01:40.240> hand<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.780> on<00:01:40.899> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
fake stall so the other hand is on the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.859 
fake stall so the other hand is on the
outside<00:01:41.469> of<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.770> hoop<00:01:42.039> we're<00:01:42.759> going<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.329> push

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
outside of the hoop we're going to push

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.980 
outside of the hoop we're going to push
or<00:01:44.140> propel<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.799> hoop<00:01:45.039> down<00:01:45.070> gently<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.359> then
