he's teammate of Lucas aiyya so it's not

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.870

going on now you would have perhaps

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.940

interesting they're running the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.110 
interesting they're running the
supercapacitor<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.380> their<00:02:43.500> storage<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.220> it

supercapacitor for their storage and it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.880 
supercapacitor for their storage and it

that much to get enough energy into the
thing<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.990> first<00:02:52.080> ten<00:02:52.320> laps

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
thing and so for the first ten laps

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.320 
thing and so for the first ten laps
actually<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.340> Porsches<00:02:53.730> look<00:02:53.910> very<00:02:54.120> good

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
actually the Porsches look very good

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.170 
actually the Porsches look very good
until<00:02:55.250> incessant<00:02:56.250> bottoming<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:56.700> through

until incessant bottoming out through
our<00:02:57.270> Rouge<00:02:57.510> eventually<00:02:58.020> paid<00:02:58.290> its<00:02:58.530> price<00:02:58.860> in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
our Rouge eventually paid its price in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.940 
our Rouge eventually paid its price in
terms<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.180> suspension<00:03:01.080> damage<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.650> both

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
terms of suspension damage and both

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.430 
terms of suspension damage and both
Porsches<00:03:02.420> one<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.540> them<00:03:03.630> did<00:03:03.780> all<00:03:03.870> right<00:03:03.900> but

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
Porsches one of them did all right but

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.280 
Porsches one of them did all right but
it<00:03:05.130> was<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> Toyotas<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.060> really<00:03:06.870> trounced

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
it was the Toyotas and really trounced

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.980 
it was the Toyotas and really trounced
the<00:03:07.380> Audi's<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.790> supposed<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.480> conclusion

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
the Audi's and I supposed the conclusion

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.600 
the Audi's and I supposed the conclusion
we<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.410> start<00:03:10.620> drawing<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.400> last

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
we have to start drawing is that last

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.130 
we have to start drawing is that last
year<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.970> Audi<00:03:12.120> did<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> significant

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
year the Audi did have a significant

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.570 
year the Audi did have a significant
power<00:03:13.320> advantage<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.890> year<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.460> new

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
power advantage this year with the new

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.670 
power advantage this year with the new
regulations<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.330> don't<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.620> is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
regulations they don't and so it is

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.190 
regulations they don't and so it is
coming<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.130> more<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.760> chassis<00:03:18.720> performance

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
coming down more to chassis performance

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.080 
coming down more to chassis performance
and<00:03:19.500> good<00:03:19.710> on<00:03:20.840> Toyota<00:03:21.860> for<00:03:22.860> doing<00:03:23.220> doing<00:03:23.910> so

and good on Toyota for doing doing so

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.700 
and good on Toyota for doing doing so
well<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.660> know<00:03:24.780> there<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.230> had<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> lot<00:03:25.650> of

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
well you know there was I had a lot of

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.320 
well you know there was I had a lot of

respect for the total Formula One team
and<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.660> was<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:27.990> sad<00:03:28.860> when<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.400> disbanded

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and I was so sad when that was disbanded

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.790 
and I was so sad when that was disbanded
and<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.420> still<00:03:30.960> believe<00:03:31.200> they<00:03:31.320> were<00:03:31.440> shuttle<00:03:31.740> II

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800

of<00:05:39.180> Nigel<00:05:39.659> he<00:05:40.199> was<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.409> I<00:05:40.740> never<00:05:41.699> actually<00:05:41.880> got

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
of Nigel he was a I never actually got

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.370 
of Nigel he was a I never actually got
on<00:05:42.240> with<00:05:42.389> him<00:05:42.509> that<00:05:42.659> well<00:05:42.840> only<00:05:42.990> because<00:05:43.289> I

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
on with him that well only because I

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.629 
on with him that well only because I
think<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:43.650> found<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.949> wrong<00:05:44.130> side<00:05:44.370> of<00:05:44.520> him

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
think I found the wrong side of him

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.430 
think I found the wrong side of him
quite<00:05:44.820> early<00:05:44.969> on<00:05:45.090> because<00:05:45.419> he<00:05:46.050> kept<00:05:46.289> catching

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
quite early on because he kept catching

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.140 
quite early on because he kept catching
me<00:05:46.710> snooping<00:05:47.070> around<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.340> garages<00:05:47.759> and

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
me snooping around the garages and

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.249 
me snooping around the garages and
looking<00:05:48.389> at<00:05:48.509> things<00:05:48.690> I<00:05:48.870> shouldn't<00:05:49.020> have<00:05:49.110> been

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
looking at things I shouldn't have been

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.110 
looking at things I shouldn't have been
looking<00:05:49.530> at<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.550> we<00:05:50.699> had<00:05:50.789> a<00:05:50.820> bit<00:05:50.969> of<00:05:51.000> a

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
looking at and so we had a bit of a

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.240 
looking at and so we had a bit of a
frosty<00:05:51.479> relationship<00:05:51.930> but<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.590> always<00:05:52.949> had<00:05:53.159> an

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
frosty relationship but I always had an

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.379 
frosty relationship but I always had an
enormous<00:05:53.340> respect<00:05:53.789> for<00:05:53.909> him<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.180> everything

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
enormous respect for him and everything

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.080 
enormous respect for him and everything
he<00:05:54.509> achieved<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.259> I<00:05:55.860> have<00:05:56.069> to<00:05:56.250> say<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.460> felt<00:05:57.000> a

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
he achieved and I have to say I felt a

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.240 
he achieved and I have to say I felt a
bit<00:05:57.210> sorry<00:05:57.389> for<00:05:57.690> him<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:58.020> way<00:05:58.169> that<00:05:58.530> whole

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
bit sorry for him the way that whole

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.059 
bit sorry for him the way that whole
Ferrari<00:05:59.819> McLaren<00:06:00.380> Spygate<00:06:01.380> thing<00:06:01.620> panned<00:06:01.889> out

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
Ferrari McLaren Spygate thing panned out

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.300 
Ferrari McLaren Spygate thing panned out
because<00:06:03.139> there<00:06:04.139> is<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.259> cause<00:06:04.560> and<00:06:04.919> a<00:06:05.159> reason

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
because there is a cause and a reason

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.870 
because there is a cause and a reason
for<00:06:05.550> everything<00:06:05.759> and<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.360> think<00:06:06.719> that<00:06:07.880> Nigel

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
for everything and I think that Nigel

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.370 
for everything and I think that Nigel
there's<00:06:09.270> no<00:06:09.419> excuse<00:06:09.900> for<00:06:09.930> what<00:06:10.319> happened

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
there's no excuse for what happened

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.529 
there's no excuse for what happened
obviously<00:06:11.009> but<00:06:11.550> I<00:06:11.580> think<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.090> reason<00:06:12.270> behind

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
obviously but I think the reason behind

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.010 
obviously but I think the reason behind
it<00:06:12.960> was<00:06:13.590> because<00:06:13.919> Nigel<00:06:14.370> felt<00:06:15.060> very<00:06:15.389> let<00:06:15.990> down

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
it was because Nigel felt very let down

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.870 
it was because Nigel felt very let down
and<00:06:16.590> disillusioned

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
and disillusioned

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.200 
and disillusioned
by<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:19.449> situation<00:06:19.630> he<00:06:20.050> was<00:06:20.080> in<00:06:20.199> once<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.850> all

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
by the situation he was in once it all

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.400 
by the situation he was in once it all
ended<00:06:22.660> once<00:06:22.930> Michael<00:06:23.350> had<00:06:24.960> once<00:06:25.960> Ross<00:06:26.169> Brawn

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
ended once Michael had once Ross Brawn

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.430 
ended once Michael had once Ross Brawn
left<00:06:26.770> basically<00:06:27.280> and<00:06:27.639> and<00:06:28.180> I<00:06:28.870> think<00:06:28.900> he<00:06:29.410> felt

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
left basically and and I think he felt

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.499 
left basically and and I think he felt
that<00:06:29.889> he<00:06:30.039> was<00:06:30.070> going<00:06:30.430> to<00:06:30.490> get<00:06:30.699> a<00:06:30.910> bigger<00:06:31.330> slice

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
that he was going to get a bigger slice

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.600 
that he was going to get a bigger slice
of<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.870> cake<00:06:31.990> for<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:32.530> future<00:06:32.919> and<00:06:33.100> didn't

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
of the cake for the future and didn't

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.070 
of the cake for the future and didn't
and<00:06:33.789> I<00:06:33.850> think<00:06:34.000> he<00:06:34.060> felt<00:06:34.270> let<00:06:34.479> down<00:06:34.509> that<00:06:34.750> he<00:06:34.960> was

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
and I think he felt let down that he was

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.080 
and I think he felt let down that he was
just<00:06:35.199> continuing<00:06:35.770> to<00:06:35.800> just<00:06:36.130> work<00:06:36.430> as<00:06:36.639> he<00:06:36.940> had

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
just continuing to just work as he had

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.360 
just continuing to just work as he had
before<00:06:37.270> and<00:06:37.720> it's<00:06:38.410> a<00:06:38.470> classic<00:06:38.830> motor<00:06:39.039> racing

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
before and it's a classic motor racing

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.770 
before and it's a classic motor racing
story<00:06:39.639> I've<00:06:39.789> seen<00:06:39.940> it<00:06:40.030> with<00:06:40.150> other<00:06:40.270> mechanics

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
story I've seen it with other mechanics

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.560 
story I've seen it with other mechanics
they<00:06:41.350> work<00:06:41.590> like<00:06:41.620> crazy<00:06:42.220> they<00:06:43.150> win<00:06:43.330> a<00:06:43.360> World

morning<00:06:45.030> life's<00:06:46.030> just<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.419> same<00:06:46.600> nothing

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
morning life's just the same nothing

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.330 
morning life's just the same nothing
ever<00:06:47.320> happens<00:06:47.710> and<00:06:47.860> there's<00:06:47.979> lots<00:06:48.070> of<00:06:48.220> people

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340

out there making a fortune and becoming

out there making a fortune and becoming
very<00:06:50.680> famous<00:06:51.130> and<00:06:51.310> and<00:06:51.729> I<00:06:52.000> think<00:06:52.060> in<00:06:52.449> Nigel's

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
very famous and and I think in Nigel's

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.650 
very famous and and I think in Nigel's
case<00:06:53.139> that<00:06:53.979> situation<00:06:54.610> got<00:06:55.150> on<00:06:55.270> top<00:06:55.419> of<00:06:55.479> him

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
case that situation got on top of him

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.990 
case that situation got on top of him
