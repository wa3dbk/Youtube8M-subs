00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
 Wei Ruzhen - I heard the sound of rain 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.410
 Lyrics: Fang Wenshan Composer: Jay Chou 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 Staying on the bamboo fence 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.200
 The glass bottle is full of small 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.500
 forest 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.600
 The youthful green is very vivid 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.200
 Light and shadow refracted by blinds 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 Like a hearty thing 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.100
 expression 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.800
 And you bow your head 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.300
 I want to know 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.700
 About me 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 Moss into the mirror 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.600
 Under the wind 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.400
 Shake once 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 Memories are one line 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.600
 Uncut landscape 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 Love is always young 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 And I heard 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.400
 Raining sound 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.500
 Think of you in lip language 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 Saying love 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.800
 Happiness can also be very quiet 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.600
 I have been very careful 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.100
 Finally heard 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.300
 Raining sound 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
 So my world 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.900
 Waking up 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.700
 I am afraid that my emotions will be red eyes. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200
 Reluctant tears 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.900
 Transparent on each other's faces 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.000
 Love is in transit 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.900
 Fate does not stop 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.600
 Who is worried 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 Raindrops dripping on the windowsill 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000
 Tap on sadness 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.900
 Beautiful and beautiful 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 And I heard 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.700
 Raining sound 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.800
 Think of you in lip language 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.500
 Saying love 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.200
 The most willful moment of love 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.900
 Desperate to the agreement 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.400
 Finally heard 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.600
 Raining sound 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.500
 So my world 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.200
 Waking up 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.900
 Found that you are always close 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.600
 Silently accompanying me 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.070
 Firm attitude
