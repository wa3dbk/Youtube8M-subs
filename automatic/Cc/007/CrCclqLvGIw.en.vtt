00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.959
 hello I'm real cries 1 and I'm going to 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.400
 Quickly apply how to save your 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.170
 data or progress of the games 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.359
 we'll start by telling you the directions 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.700
 more as of course not all games 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.830
 they keep them in the same direction we 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.830
 we will go to documents 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.760
 then we will go here in the case 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:41.969
 of 3 pro evolution will always embroider it 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 in this folder called konami 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.320
 in my case I have only the fish pro 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.760
 evolution soccer 12 but if I had the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 11 to 9 to 10 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.380
 I was not here too 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 let's say that 90% of the data 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.460
 advance of the games are saved here 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.080
 save our data is very simple 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.490
 they showed you example 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.490
 we will copy this folder 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.480
 and we will save it on a hard disk of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.900
 assurance that it is not the same as 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.090
 operating system we will keep it either 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.260
 in the lion depending on what we have 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.300
 in my case the renal guards of 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.620
 I have created a special folder for 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.620
 all the profiles of the games 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.710
 here I have some like the mold guanter the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.850
 total have 12 carbon are games that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.390
 he always finds them now in my 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 documents 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.950
 we hit it and so we ensure the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.950
 profile 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.910
 as I already have an advanced profile 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.910
 I will say that not for you keep it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.200
 there is a profile that is very difficult to 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 find that it's like the pop3 profile 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.030
 this belongs to the principle of persia no 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.440
 is in my document and as well as 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.300
 this game I'm sure there will be 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 many more that are not in my 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.360
 documents I will show you a second 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.630
 edition 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.360
 that would be in its place of installation 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.850
 the principle is never very common that 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.820
 install on the computer program but that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.350
 is outside of you we are going to install 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.010
 they decide to install where they want 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.400
 find those found are men 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.530
 remember if you have the prince of persia 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.330
 so will the name be the name where it 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.490
 find the saved files 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.470
 and if you have any doubts, these are the 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.760
 helps you'll find your name on 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.770
 name your profile and two files 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.810
 saved if you've advanced a lot and you keep 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.840
 two images then it will be awaited 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.840
 Y 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.340

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.920
