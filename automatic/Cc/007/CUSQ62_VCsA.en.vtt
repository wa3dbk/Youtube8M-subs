00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
scale a lot of humidity so we had

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
scale a lot of humidity so we had
showers<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> storms<00:01:07.470> last<00:01:07.680> night<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
showers and storms last night and that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
showers and storms last night and that
did<00:01:09.480> not<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.900> rid<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.230> humidity<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.980> today

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
did not get rid of the humidity so today

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
did not get rid of the humidity so today
is<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> day<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.970> talk<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.330> another

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
is a day that we talk about another

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
is a day that we talk about another
round<00:01:13.410> of<00:01:13.650> warmth<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> mugginess<00:01:14.730> but<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
round of warmth and mugginess but I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.790 
round of warmth and mugginess but I
don't<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.630> we'll<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.780> showers<00:01:16.620> and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
don't think we'll have showers and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.230 
don't think we'll have showers and
thunderstorms<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.490> afternoon<00:01:17.550> there<00:01:18.150> may

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
be an isolated thundershower that tries

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
be an isolated thundershower that tries
to<00:01:19.740> pop<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.150> afternoon<00:01:21.570> hours<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.020> for

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to pop up in the afternoon hours but for

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
to pop up in the afternoon hours but for
the<00:01:22.260> most<00:01:22.380> part<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:22.680> talking<00:01:22.980> about<00:01:23.160> he

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the most part we're talking about he

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
the most part we're talking about he

maybe a pop-up shower south of the Mass
Pike<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:30.090> only<00:01:30.180> about<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.390> 20%<00:01:30.750> chance
