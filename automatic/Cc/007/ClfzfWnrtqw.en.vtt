00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.480
 or 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.110
 this will keep for a while in elda 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.110
 good 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.210
 on the Mexican side 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.890
 while the cold front passes it goes to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 see if it can be a storm 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.030
 because the relative humidity is very high 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.729
 back to the right about 220 more 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.729
 or less 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 usually as a king page 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.670
 with the car 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.090
 in the red 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.340
 If your money is aggressions 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.340
 to put in the raid 6 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.780
 and also the capricious ones of the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.740
 clouds will give you false horizons or not 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.740
 pay attention to the clouds 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.879
 it has arrived 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.209
 the bagel a little bit to the power for 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.209
 have better control 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.450
 something long green you'll start to 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.450
 accelerate it for the flashes scenarios 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.810
 when between six clouds evaluate the plane 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.810
 principal 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.650
 arrives 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.080
 you the sky 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.300
 I will not change the dial is in the number 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.300
 2 also so that we have as backup 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.440
 and yesterday 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.100
 perfect 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.629
 exists 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.720
 I want to arrive 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.870
 to stop moving the needles of 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.870
 ivac ussr 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.180
 comes begins to follow 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.639
 to 314 in the genius at about 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.250
 little up the height but I think 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.620
 that this can go down to 1900 to 1800 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.300
 can go down to 1800 that is established 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.710
 in low 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.710
 on the left 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.530
 a little more to the right for the 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.590
 compensate for the wind 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:08.660
 and now use the pedals to maintain the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.660
 needle up sensor 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.320
 you have to beat in 1800 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.900
 up is a little by the height 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.689
 it's easy to use half the correction 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.619
 of what you are using 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:37.619
 here in the green to see
