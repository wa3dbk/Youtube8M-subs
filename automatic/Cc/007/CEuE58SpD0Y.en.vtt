thoroughly<00:01:49.409> dissolved<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.880> turn<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
thoroughly dissolved and then turn on

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.249 
thoroughly dissolved and then turn on
the<00:01:51.600> heat<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.549> bring<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> boil<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the heat and bring this to a boil and it

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.160 
the heat and bring this to a boil and it
will<00:01:55.409> thicken<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.420> it'll<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> lumpy

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
will thicken and it'll be kind of lumpy

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
will thicken and it'll be kind of lumpy
at<00:01:58.290> first<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:58.770> don't<00:01:59.009> worry<00:01:59.219> it'll<00:01:59.579> often<00:01:59.820> out

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
at first but don't worry it'll often out

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.560 
at first but don't worry it'll often out
and<00:02:00.950> my<00:02:01.950> battery<00:02:02.219> died<00:02:02.729> while<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.360> making

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and my battery died while I was making

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230 
and my battery died while I was making
this<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.530> here's<00:02:04.979> how<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.399> turned<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
this but here's how it turned out and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
this but here's how it turned out and
this<00:02:06.479> version<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> little<00:02:07.890> thicker<00:02:08.310> because

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this version is a little thicker because

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.639 
this version is a little thicker because
there's<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> pulp<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> fruit

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
there's some of the pulp from the fruit

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.490 
there's some of the pulp from the fruit
in<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.300> so

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
in it so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.750 
in it so
that's<00:02:12.620> how<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:13.040> make<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.520> jelly

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
that's how you can make the jelly

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.600 
that's how you can make the jelly
filling<00:02:14.090> from<00:02:14.690> frozen<00:02:15.020> berries<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.400> could

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
filling from frozen berries you could

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.780 
filling from frozen berries you could
use<00:02:16.760> fresh<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.360> grow<00:02:17.540> your<00:02:17.720> own<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:19.370> next

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
use fresh if you grow your own the next

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.840 
use fresh if you grow your own the next
time<00:02:20.000> around<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.750> took<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.140> easy<00:02:21.290> way<00:02:21.530> out<00:02:21.850> for

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
time around I took the easy way out for

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.270 
time around I took the easy way out for
this<00:02:23.000> version<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.720> used<00:02:23.990> one<00:02:24.320> cup<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.800> cranberry

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
this version I used one cup of cranberry

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.190 
this version I used one cup of cranberry
raspberry<00:02:25.520> juice<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.660> way<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.050> whole

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
raspberry juice and this way is a whole

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.140 
raspberry juice and this way is a whole
lot<00:02:27.410> cheaper<00:02:27.710> because<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.460> whole<00:02:28.670> bottle

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
lot cheaper because this whole bottle

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.040 
lot cheaper because this whole bottle
was<00:02:29.360> 250<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.430> those<00:02:31.430> frozen<00:02:31.910> berries<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.750> 12

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
was 250 and those frozen berries for 12

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.350 
was 250 and those frozen berries for 12
ounces<00:02:33.470> was<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:34.280> think<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.910> three<00:02:35.090> dollars

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
ounces was I think like three dollars

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.970 
ounces was I think like three dollars
this<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.570> already<00:02:38.959> sweetened<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.709> doesn't

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
this is already sweetened so it doesn't

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.190 
this is already sweetened so it doesn't
need<00:02:40.100> all<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.280> much<00:02:40.730> sugar<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.270> had<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> quarter

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
need all that much sugar I had a quarter

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.440 
need all that much sugar I had a quarter
cup<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.620> sugar

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
cup of sugar

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.360 
cup of sugar
then<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.480> added<00:02:44.780> two<00:02:45.170> tablespoons<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:46.100> clear

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
then I added two tablespoons of clear

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.490 
then I added two tablespoons of clear
gel<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.940> once<00:02:47.120> again<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.690> burner<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.140> not<00:02:48.320> on

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
gel and once again this burner is not on

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.280 
gel and once again this burner is not on
yet<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:49.040> mixture<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.550> cool<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.510> stir<00:02:51.020> them

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
yet this mixture is cool then stir them

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.170 
yet this mixture is cool then stir them
thoroughly<00:02:51.560> until<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.370> clear<00:02:52.610> gel<00:02:52.910> is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
thoroughly until the clear gel is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.960 
thoroughly until the clear gel is
dissolved<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.100> turn<00:02:55.100> on<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.400> heat<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.880> bring

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
dissolved and turn on the heat and bring

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.580 
dissolved and turn on the heat and bring
it<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.959> boil

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
it to a boil

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.430 
it to a boil
I<00:02:57.739> also<00:02:58.670> made<00:02:59.270> an<00:02:59.510> apple<00:02:59.720> filling<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.290> was

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
I also made an apple filling that was

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.410 
I also made an apple filling that was
pretty<00:03:00.680> good<00:03:00.920> with<00:03:01.250> apple<00:03:01.700> juice<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.300> did

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
pretty good with apple juice I just did

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.880 
pretty good with apple juice I just did
it<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> same<00:03:02.810> way<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.590> added<00:03:03.770> some

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
it the same way and I added some

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.979 
it the same way and I added some
cinnamon<00:03:04.520> for<00:03:04.700> flavoring<00:03:05.270> I'm<00:03:05.630> sure<00:03:05.840> you

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
cinnamon for flavoring I'm sure you

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.750 
cinnamon for flavoring I'm sure you
could<00:03:06.140> use<00:03:06.320> any<00:03:06.500> type<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.770> juice<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.310> want<00:03:07.489> for

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
could use any type of juice you want for

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.020 
could use any type of juice you want for
this<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.530> could<00:03:09.709> probably<00:03:09.890> can<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.790> as

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
this and you could probably can this as

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.540 
this and you could probably can this as
well<00:03:11.239> if<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.600> wanted<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.110> buy<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.860> whole<00:03:13.340> bottle

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
well if you wanted to buy a whole bottle

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.930 
well if you wanted to buy a whole bottle
of<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.360> cranberry<00:03:14.780> raspberry<00:03:15.260> juice<00:03:15.890> make<00:03:16.730> up

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
of the cranberry raspberry juice make up

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.150 
of the cranberry raspberry juice make up
the<00:03:17.120> entire<00:03:17.450> batch<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.260> then<00:03:18.500> can<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the entire batch and then can it the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.060 
the entire batch and then can it the
same<00:03:19.400> as<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:19.730> would<00:03:19.940> for<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.690> pie<00:03:21.080> filling<00:03:21.590> that

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
same as you would for a pie filling that

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.420 
same as you would for a pie filling that
has<00:03:22.280> clear<00:03:22.549> gel<00:03:22.760> in<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.680> also<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.980> thickening

has clear gel in it also the thickening
of<00:03:25.700> clear<00:03:26.030> gel<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.540> not<00:03:26.750> dependent<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.530> having

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
of clear gel is not dependent on having

of clear gel is not dependent on having
sugar<00:03:28.519> in<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.000> recipe<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.049> didn't

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
sugar in the recipe so if you didn't

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.690 
sugar in the recipe so if you didn't
want<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.530> add<00:03:30.680> any<00:03:30.709> sugar<00:03:31.160> at<00:03:31.370> all<00:03:31.489> you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
want to add any sugar at all you

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.180 
want to add any sugar at all you
wouldn't<00:03:31.970> have<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.480> or<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.500> could<00:03:33.709> add

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
wouldn't have to or you could add

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.880 
wouldn't have to or you could add
Splenda<00:03:34.790> if<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.120> wanted<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.690> diabetic<00:03:36.260> version

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
Splenda if you wanted a diabetic version

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.050 
Splenda if you wanted a diabetic version
of<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:37.820> filling<00:03:38.390> as<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:40.010> can<00:03:40.160> see<00:03:40.459> once<00:03:40.820> this

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
of this filling as you can see once this

of this filling as you can see once this
clear<00:03:41.420> gel<00:03:41.600> starts<00:03:42.079> thickening<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.829> goes
