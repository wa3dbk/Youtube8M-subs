I<00:04:06.640> can<00:04:07.480> take<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.200> create<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.680> cube<00:04:09.040> by

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
I can take and create a cube by

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.090 
I can take and create a cube by

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
with my object created you'll notice

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.020 
with my object created you'll notice
that<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.610> cube<00:04:21.150> sits<00:04:21.690> right<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.490> axis

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
that a cube sits right on the axis

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.870 
that a cube sits right on the axis
rather<00:04:24.330> than<00:04:24.540> being<00:04:24.780> centered<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:26.190> origin

rather than being centered on the origin

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.330 
rather than being centered on the origin
of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.150> scene<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:28.200> what<00:04:28.380> I'll<00:04:28.530> do<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:29.010> I'll

of the scene so what I'll do is I'll

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.520 
of the scene so what I'll do is I'll
take<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.850> click<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.750> tools<00:04:31.020> button<00:04:31.260> in

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
object that centers the cube so that I

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.410 
object that centers the cube so that I
don't<00:04:43.620> have<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.950> line<00:04:44.310> anything<00:04:44.820> up<00:04:45.150> and

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
don't have to line anything up and

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.830 
don't have to line anything up and
because<00:04:46.230> I<00:04:46.380> previously<00:04:46.800> placed<00:04:47.370> my<00:04:48.090> car<00:04:48.450> bages

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
because I previously placed my car bages

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.620 
because I previously placed my car bages
in<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.230> center<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.770> canvas<00:04:50.460> space<00:04:50.760> you

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
in the center of that canvas space you

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.580 
in the center of that canvas space you
can<00:04:51.840> see<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.400> they<00:04:53.400> coincide<00:04:54.090> with<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.590> cube

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
can see that they coincide with the cube

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.820 
can see that they coincide with the cube
being<00:04:55.970> centered<00:04:56.970> on<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.150> origin<00:04:57.750> now<00:04:58.680> I'll

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
being centered on the origin now I'll

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.830 
being centered on the origin now I'll
simply<00:04:59.250> take<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.820> select<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.270> scale<00:05:00.630> tool

simply take and select the scale tool

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.720 
simply take and select the scale tool
and<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:02.430> can<00:05:02.670> take<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.240> non<00:05:03.960> uniform<00:05:04.650> scale<00:05:05.070> my

these features if I adjust the scale

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.980 
these features if I adjust the scale
slider<00:06:36.680> this<00:06:37.680> will<00:06:37.919> take<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:38.520> make<00:06:39.360> the<00:06:39.630> scale

the slider to the left to the right but

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.350 
the slider to the left to the right but
i<00:06:48.450> can<00:06:48.660> also<00:06:48.810> key<00:06:49.260> in<00:06:49.470> values<00:06:49.980> for<00:06:50.850> precision

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
i can also key in values for precision

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.839 
i can also key in values for precision
sake

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.169 

we<00:06:58.479> also<00:06:58.659> have<00:06:59.020> aspect<00:06:59.529> ratio<00:07:00.009> here<00:07:00.819> I<00:07:00.879> can

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:01.179 
we also have aspect ratio here I can

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.809 
we also have aspect ratio here I can
take<00:07:01.419> and<00:07:01.629> adjust<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.319> horizontal<00:07:02.919> stretch

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:03.819 
take and adjust the horizontal stretch

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.299 
take and adjust the horizontal stretch
of<00:07:04.119> an<00:07:04.569> image<00:07:04.869> and<00:07:05.110> this<00:07:05.259> helps<00:07:05.619> when<00:07:06.099> my

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:06.309 
of an image and this helps when my

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:10.219 
of an image and this helps when my
reference<00:07:06.849> image<00:07:07.240> is<00:07:07.499> distorted<00:07:08.999> either

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
reference image is distorted either

reference image is distorted either
horizontally<00:07:11.229> or<00:07:11.259> vertically<00:07:11.740> I<00:07:12.069> can<00:07:12.490> use

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
horizontally or vertically I can use

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:16.469 
horizontally or vertically I can use
this<00:07:12.849> aspect<00:07:13.330> ratio<00:07:13.779> to<00:07:14.409> take<00:07:14.649> and<00:07:15.270> make<00:07:16.270> it

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
this aspect ratio to take and make it

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:22.629 
this aspect ratio to take and make it
correct

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.360

moves the image right with the vertical
offset<00:07:40.189> slider<00:07:40.669> I<00:07:41.150> can<00:07:41.870> also<00:07:42.050> move<00:07:42.590> the<00:07:42.650> image

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.009 
offset slider I can also move the image

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:48.640 
offset slider I can also move the image
upward<00:07:43.789> with<00:07:44.060> a<00:07:44.090> positive<00:07:44.659> value<00:07:45.969> or<00:07:47.650> downward

transparency<00:07:53.360> slider<00:07:53.689> which<00:07:54.680> allows<00:07:55.009> us<00:07:55.250> to

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.430 
transparency slider which allows us to

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.420 
transparency slider which allows us to

the viewport if I move the slider to the

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.510 
the viewport if I move the slider to the
left<00:08:03.800> it'll<00:08:04.699> make<00:08:04.879> the<00:08:05.060> image<00:08:05.360> more<00:08:05.569> faint

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.189 
left it'll make the image more faint
this<00:08:07.520> allows<00:08:07.849> us<00:08:07.879> to<00:08:08.090> help<00:08:08.449> see<00:08:08.689> our<00:08:08.870> geometry
