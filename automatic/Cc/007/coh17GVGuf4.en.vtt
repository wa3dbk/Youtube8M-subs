martially thing you obviously can click
this<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.090> like<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:33.760> plexi<00:01:34.760> pedal<00:01:35.060> we<00:01:35.240> have

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
this in and like the plexi pedal we have

this in and like the plexi pedal we have
the<00:01:35.540> hot<00:01:35.690> switch<00:01:35.990> which<00:01:36.170> basically<00:01:36.740> brings<00:01:37.100> it

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
the hot switch which basically brings it

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.280 
the hot switch which basically brings it
into<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:38.470> modded<00:01:39.700> plexi<00:01:40.700> head<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.780> delay<00:01:42.080> you

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
into a modded plexi head the delay you

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.070 
into a modded plexi head the delay you
have<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> tab<00:01:42.770> control<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.370> can<00:01:43.430> tap<00:01:43.730> tempo

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
have a tab control so you can tap tempo

have a tab control so you can tap tempo
obviously<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.440> off<00:01:45.560> both<00:01:45.860> again<00:01:46.130> all<00:01:46.460> all

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
obviously on and off both again all all

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.149 
obviously on and off both again all all
of<00:01:47.150> them<00:01:47.240> silent<00:01:47.510> foot<00:01:47.870> switching<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.010> have

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
of them silent foot switching you have

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.880 
of them silent foot switching you have
your<00:01:49.340> level<00:01:49.700> your<00:01:50.030> sets<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.510> repeats<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.229> that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
your level your sets of repeats and that

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.070 
your level your sets of repeats and that
we've<00:01:52.580> designed<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.270> it's<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.690> tape

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
we've designed this so it's like a tape

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.740 
we've designed this so it's like a tape
echo<00:01:54.290> where<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.710> get<00:01:54.830> degeneration<00:01:55.430> as<00:01:55.820> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
echo where you get degeneration as the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.649 
echo where you get degeneration as the
repeats<00:01:57.170> go<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.950> your<00:01:58.610> time<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.510> set

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
repeats go on and your time you can set

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.240 
repeats go on and your time you can set
your<00:01:59.780> time<00:02:00.020> delay<00:02:00.260> now<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.010> drift

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
your time delay now this is drift

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.010 
your time delay now this is drift
control<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.729> cool<00:02:01.940> it's<00:02:02.150> like<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.390> modulation

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
control is cool it's like a modulation

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.469 
control is cool it's like a modulation
so<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.799> can<00:02:03.950> get<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> chorus<00:02:04.610> II<00:02:04.760> type<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.210> sound

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
so you can get a chorus II type of sound

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
from and again these are designed for

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.400 
from and again these are designed for
bass<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.209> lower<00:02:55.480> frequency<00:02:56.049> here's<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410

bass to the lower frequency here's the
boost<00:02:56.620> fuzz<00:02:56.859> we<00:02:57.010> were<00:02:57.129> just<00:02:57.280> talking<00:02:57.640> about

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
boost fuzz we were just talking about

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.470 
boost fuzz we were just talking about
over<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:59.549> this<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> boost<00:03:01.060> chorus

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
over there and this is a boost chorus

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.349 
over there and this is a boost chorus
again<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:02.049> bass<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.519> vary<00:03:03.970> your<00:03:04.180> amount

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
again for bass you can vary your amount

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.960 
again for bass you can vary your amount
of<00:03:04.799> with<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:06.129> is<00:03:06.280> kind<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> whiff

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
of with this is kind of like a whiff

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.780 
of with this is kind of like a whiff
control<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.750> can<00:03:07.870> change<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.549> tight

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
control so you can change get it tight

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.399 
control so you can change get it tight
to<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.150> real<00:03:10.329> no<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.599> really<00:03:10.989> give<00:03:11.109> it<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.260> lot

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
to the real no to really give it a lot

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:20.480 
to the real no to really give it a lot
of<00:03:11.530> wobble<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.069> stuff

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.030 

so<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:22.550> basically<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:25.260> get<00:03:25.410> his<00:03:25.560> based<00:03:25.800> on

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
so this is basically to get his based on

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.310 
so this is basically to get his based on
the<00:03:26.250> character<00:03:26.700> series<00:03:27.050> California<00:03:28.050> blonde

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
the character series California blonde

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.190 
the character series California blonde
panel<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:29.820> have<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.060> little<00:03:30.300> bit<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.630> dirt<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:31.050> it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
panel we have a little bit of dirt on it

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:45.030 
panel we have a little bit of dirt on it
we<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.500> clean<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.740> up<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.670> get<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.970> real

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.580 

then<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.189> can<00:03:46.370> drive<00:03:46.609> it<00:03:46.849> you<00:03:47.420> get<00:03:47.629> a<00:03:47.659> nice

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
then we can drive it you get a nice

00:03:48.590 --> 00:04:06.020 
then we can drive it you get a nice
offend<00:03:48.980> every<00:03:49.219> type<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.430> all-wheel<00:03:49.879> drive

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:05:13.110 

I'll<00:04:07.030> be<00:04:07.209> going<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.510> Flexi<00:04:07.900> side

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.360 

heard<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.270> up<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.660> wired<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.890> here<00:05:16.220> the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
heard this up and wired it here the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:29.080 
heard this up and wired it here the
delay

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.659 

again<00:05:30.090> is<00:05:30.240> like<00:05:30.419> a<00:05:30.449> modulation<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:32.490> get<00:05:32.639> a

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
again is like a modulation so you get a

00:05:32.669 --> 00:06:10.260 
again is like a modulation so you get a
chorus<00:05:33.120> II<00:05:33.270> type<00:05:33.479> sound

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.160

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
and again weighs 18 ounces comes with a

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.440 
and again weighs 18 ounces comes with a
universal<00:06:15.770> power<00:06:15.950> supply<00:06:16.490> just<00:06:17.150> throw<00:06:17.330> in

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
universal power supply just throw in

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.880 
universal power supply just throw in
