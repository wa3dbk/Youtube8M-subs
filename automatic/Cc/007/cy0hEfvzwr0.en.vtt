00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.510
 how it works 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.510
 today film how it works 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.079
 motorcycles 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.439
 we take an important plant where they go with 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.089
 conveyor belt 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.029
 clay pipe making shrouded 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.279
 darkness 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.890
 drum sticks about them can pop no 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.439
 ceasing 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.919
 and as a consequence 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.089
 from this story takes your breath away 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.300
 at first 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.290
 how it works 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.880
 motorcycle invention in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.280
 nineteenth century was caused by chase 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.810
 speeds people wanted to fall into 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.640
 right place faster than allowed 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.319
 bicycle 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:44.380
 and so they 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.000
 attached to the bike motor 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.530
 today's motorcycles are much 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.420
 harder so the previous models behind 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 they will fail 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 and here and motorcycles triumph technique 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.990
 first of all was the wind my mind u 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.840
 whom aluminum that it provides 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.840
 speed and low fuel costs 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.980
 ramus clear 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.120
 on the glade of her paint and burned to 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 the paint swore 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.700
 on the left engine block 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 set the crankshaft and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 pistons 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.500
 fasten gaskets and plugs and then 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560
 water is a semicircular instrument which 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.930
 called fork it drives the pistons 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.930
 vertical position 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.650
 then other tools 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.730
 live piston rings so they 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.900
 Easily fit into place when installing the second 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
 half cylinder block 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.180
 on the blog install seals 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 and then steel cylinder cover 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.540
 electric screwdrivers 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.100
 spin the balts pinning jumps on 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.589
 cylinder blocks 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.679
 set the cam rolls 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.339
 cylinder head 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.279
 Ball will lead the movement of the valves which 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.989
 pass air and fuel and displays 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.989
 traffic fumes 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.369
 crankshaft turn to class 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.369
 his work 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.099
 now it's time to test its engine 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.269
 fill the cooling 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.819
 a solution with a mask and fuel and then 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.969
 check on all gears checks 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.399
 where leaks worked in general 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.809
 after checking coolant 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.809
 poured from the engine 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.340
 motorcycle engine should not only 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.540
 work well but look good 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.699
 because it is not hidden under the hood 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.699
 wholly 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.379
 then 120 pounds 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.489
 engine and allowed to the forum 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 career set 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 on it fix the frame 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.029
 mounted got a rear wheel 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.029
 and then with the front 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.929
 roller and secured using the right 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.929
 twisting basil 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:46.139
 tighten the braking device then 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.139
 poured into the radiators of the antichrist 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.329
 meanwhile in the paint shop 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.329
 robots are working hard 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.349
 colored parts mounted on 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.329
 motorcycles first element with glass then 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.329
 cover and finally the body 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.139
 then collects devices such as 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.139
 speedometer his level gauges 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.180
 fuel 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.829
 this part is called the front fairing 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.829
 and put before vibor 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.859
 front fairing dashboard 

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:33.859
 down on motorcycles 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 and then to the village is fixed on the frame 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.800
 and finally puts the cap on the exhaust 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 pipe 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.879
 check all roles securely fixed 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.150
 drive up dynamometer 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.889
 installations which measures 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.889
 mechanical power 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.840
 checking the speed of the motorcycle brakes 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.740
 beep control system and 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.280
 automatic devices 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.069
 maintain speed 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.210
 m 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.199
 every motorcycle passes this 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:23.809
 control 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.659
 if everything is okay 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.509
 the roads 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:29.539
