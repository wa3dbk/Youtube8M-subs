that if I come over here and let's go

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.410 
that if I come over here and let's go
ahead<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.370> add<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> layer<00:00:35.790> style<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
ahead and add a layer style to one of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
ahead and add a layer style to one of
these<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> take<00:00:37.649> layer<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
these if you want to take layer one and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
these if you want to take layer one and
put<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> drop<00:00:39.600> shadow<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.290> maybe<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
put a drop shadow in there maybe want to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.670 
put a drop shadow in there maybe want to
change<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.460> angle<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.960> distance<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
change the angle and the distance and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.279 
change the angle and the distance and
maybe<00:00:44.579> change<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> size<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> little<00:00:45.510> bit<00:00:45.750> any

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
maybe change the size a little bit any

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.080 
maybe change the size a little bit any
of<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.559> different<00:00:46.770> variables<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of those different variables we like you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.639 
of those different variables we like you
see<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.480> now<00:00:48.629> choose<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.500> our

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
see we can now choose to make that our

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.889 
see we can now choose to make that our
default<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> next<00:00:51.360> time<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.629> come<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
default and so the next time we come in

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
default and so the next time we come in
here<00:00:52.079> rather<00:00:52.289> than<00:00:52.410> having<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> change<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
here rather than having to change all of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
here rather than having to change all of
those<00:00:54.149> individual<00:00:54.660> variables<00:00:55.110> things<00:00:55.590> will

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
those individual variables things will

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.380 
those individual variables things will
look<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
look just the way we want them to the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
look just the way we want them to the
way<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.109> too<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
way we like them too and we can do that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.650 
way we like them too and we can do that
with<00:00:59.370> any<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.000> come<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.270> stroke

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
with any of these I can come into stroke

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
with any of these I can come into stroke
and<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.260> could<00:01:01.410> say<00:01:01.620> let's<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> light

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and I could say let's go with a light

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.420 
and I could say let's go with a light
blue<00:01:03.149> color<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.799> maybe<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> be

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
blue color and maybe I want it to be

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.230 
blue color and maybe I want it to be
much<00:01:06.210> smaller<00:01:07.130> make<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.549> default<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
much smaller make that my default and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.750 
much smaller make that my default and
we'll<00:01:10.170> say<00:01:10.350> okay<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> next<00:01:11.549> time<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
we'll say okay and so the next time I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.100 
we'll say okay and so the next time I
come<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.030> let's<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.570> imagine<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
come in let's just imagine we have a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
come in let's just imagine we have a
completely<00:01:13.799> different<00:01:14.070> file<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:15.180> i<00:01:15.210> click

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
completely different file when i click

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.210 
completely different file when i click
on<00:01:15.570> drop<00:01:15.840> shadow<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.560> i<00:01:16.590> click<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.979> stroke

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
on drop shadow when i click on stroke

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
on drop shadow when i click on stroke
those<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.119> new<00:01:18.330> defaults<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.080> they've

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
those are my new defaults and they've

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
those are my new defaults and they've
saved<00:01:19.650> me<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> ton<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> time<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.060> people

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
saved me a ton of time for people

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.730 
saved me a ton of time for people
spending<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> lot<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> time<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.140> layer<00:01:22.290> styles

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
spending a lot of time in layer styles

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.190 
spending a lot of time in layer styles
this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.790> dozens<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> dozens<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this is really dozens and dozens of

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
this is really dozens and dozens of
different<00:01:25.409> jdi<00:01:25.950> features<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.240> we

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
different jdi features all in one and we

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660 
different jdi features all in one and we
realize<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> rather<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:28.680> coming<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.490> with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
realize that rather than coming out with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.429 
realize that rather than coming out with
new<00:01:29.700> defaults<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.659> allowing<00:01:31.320> people

ability to make that selection apply to
all<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.420> them<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.780> don't<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.230> wait<00:02:34.410> for

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
all of them so we don't have to wait for

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
all of them so we don't have to wait for
the<00:02:34.650> dialog<00:02:35.040> box<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.520> pop<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.120> each<00:02:36.330> and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
every file now one or two files this

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.190 
every file now one or two files this
probably<00:02:38.880> isn't<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.180> big<00:02:39.330> deal<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.989> for

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
probably isn't a big deal but for

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.090 
probably isn't a big deal but for
someone<00:02:40.350> who's<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.769> production

someone who's in a production

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.680 
someone who's in a production
environment<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.060> there's<00:02:42.269> working<00:02:42.540> with

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
environment so there's working with

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.690 
environment so there's working with
dozens<00:02:43.110> or<00:02:43.200> hundreds<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.709> files<00:02:43.920> building<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
enormous time-saver so there you have

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.259

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
just a few more jdi features that are

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.820 
just a few more jdi features that are
currently<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.720> development<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:52.620> not

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.100
