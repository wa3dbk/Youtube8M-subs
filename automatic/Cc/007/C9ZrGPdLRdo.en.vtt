 the information of the best of the most 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 interesting that there is in the world of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 Animation cinema comics et cetera etcetera 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 there's also music from this man that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.179
 talk to them 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.719
 we are talking today about a topic that I think 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:48.629
 very particular that I found out I just 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.089
 find out exactly what we see the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.120
 man the child that we see there in the 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.430
 screen that man is called a needle 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 we know not to catch if the son of goku 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 and chichi or milk as they know some 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 other places but originally it 's a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.950
 chichi man then the son of goku and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.320
 chichi is called gohan if we approach 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.440
 the stage where they fight against cell 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.920
 do not want to call him this character 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.810
 called cojan is transformed into super 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.810
 saiyan or super serious gender as 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.240
 they want to say level 2 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.700
 this was called level 2 for why 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 I do not know if it 's okay because first in a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.420
 moment has begun to be called level 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.420
 2 in the stage that goku fights against 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.039
 Goku is who says what is called each 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.659
 level of transformation when 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.789
 fighting against this character and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.200
 remember that in this series there is a 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.939
 moment in which you hands by 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.580
 first time or at least for the first 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.369
 once in sight ours in super cdi in 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.729
 level 3 when all that comes back 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.080
 those you when you first tell 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.979
 mirabeau book tells you this is like this 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.470
 look what happens, level 2 says 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 this what happens and immediately afterwards 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.679
 show level 3 that is not what 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 what matters is that we understand 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.910
 at that moment that level 2 does 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.220
 reference to the same thing that happens to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.680
 leaf when it fights against cells and kill 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.930
 to android 16 at that time he 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 transforms into what would be level 2 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.420
 but this is perhaps truly the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.940
 level 2 or as the creators good already 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.070
 the creators here call you like the weight 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.970
 call this transformation that does not 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.940
 gave it a name 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.890
 It appeared no mistake what I love you today 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.690
 comment what is the real name of this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.300
 transformation that he had first 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.610
 although we will not hear it from 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.640
 the mouth of the characters because if he has 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.660
 there have been books if there have been 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.740
 compilations of information where 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.510
 he gave another name completely 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.730
 different to this transformation and that's 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.700
 what I'm going to tell you how we study and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.980
 why in a book called film anime 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.950
 dragon ball z comics that was launched in 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.959
 1993 ie before the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.630
 television came out this scene from the cocu 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.459
 where he explains the three levels or 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.720
 this is the first explanation the first 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.580
 name that they once had 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.240
 transformations what explains this 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.790
 book is that although in the first 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.130
 version would be the uv there is no other a little 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.080
 more potent than the 2 becomes the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.470
 third transformation of super saiyan 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.330
 super followed would be when you can see 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.590
 for example boku vegeta or trans 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.110
 any of these that is transform 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.780
 as hyper muscled and they exploit the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.350
 muscles so terrible 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.230
 I mean, I explain it like the long hair 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.160
 actually it had first been considered 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.900
 and third to another then then comes 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.040
 a fourth and this book explains 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.950
 specifically that the transformation of 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.370
 wuhan that would be the level 2 is not like that 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.920
 that that 's level 5 then it's very 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.819
 curious to note that first this 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.390
 people who created this story named as 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.250
 level 5 what we met by 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.060
 a lot of time as level 2 to gender 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.769
 I said it or something happened then 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.700
 they decided that if this one really 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.290
 out level 2 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.880
 eventually here the television in a 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.660
 moment decided that this was level 2 and 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.130
 it was level 2 of curious transformation 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.960
 data that I simply wanted to tell you 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.550
 you know we're still talking about the dragon 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.229
 ball z because if the battle of the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.020
 gods of that movie is already very 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.510
 soon it will come out as I told you in the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.160
 video that has many views that in 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.630
 this channel if you look at wine with many 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.810
 views that is not pornography or anything 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.150
 weird and that video talked about the battle 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.610
 so check that video because 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.800
 he really threw all the info on 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.150
 this movie that already comes out and you know 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.560
 subscribe they give me like they share is 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.630
 then leave your comments and 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.860
 opinions because then we know we 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.150
 we communicate and see what it is that 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.160
 we want to continue talking and what we 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.850
 interesting and what does not interest us the ctt 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.529
 evidently 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.969
