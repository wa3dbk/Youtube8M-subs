you<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.430> twist<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> turn<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> any<00:01:27.360> way<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
you just twist and turn it any way that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.770 
you just twist and turn it any way that
you<00:01:27.720> feel<00:01:28.080> looks<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> best<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.729> now<00:01:30.720> the

you feel looks the best in you now the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
you feel looks the best in you now the
third<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.310> love<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> wear

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
third way is the way that I love to wear

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.539 
third way is the way that I love to wear
my<00:01:33.600> scarves<00:01:34.140> year-round<00:01:34.500> even<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> dead

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
my scarves year-round even in the dead

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
my scarves year-round even in the dead
of<00:01:35.579> winter<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> take<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.170> front

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
of winter so you take it right in front

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.609 
of winter so you take it right in front
and<00:01:37.680> you'll<00:01:38.310> loop<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.780> back<00:01:39.960> across<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and you'll loop it in the back across it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
and you'll loop it in the back across it
just<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.270> right<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.420> front<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
just like that right in front with the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
just like that right in front with the
two<00:01:42.899> ends<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.430> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
two ends now what you can do with this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
two ends now what you can do with this
third<00:01:44.759> way<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> either<00:01:45.960> make

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
third way is this you can either make

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.219 
third way is this you can either make
the<00:01:46.380> ends<00:01:46.770> even<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.899> really

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the ends even you can make this really

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
the ends even you can make this really
high<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.369> bring<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.240> it's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
high you can bring this down so it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
high you can bring this down so it's
really<00:01:51.570> low<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.200> looks<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.680> one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
really low so it looks like this one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.039 
really low so it looks like this one
thing<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.610> love<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.329> don't<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.659> why<00:01:54.840> I'm

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
one ends higher and one end lower just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
one ends higher and one end lower just
to<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> change<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.110> can

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to kind of change it up a bit so we can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
kind of call it sneaking it around my

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880 
kind of call it sneaking it around my
neck<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> long<00:02:10.080> scarf<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.800> goes

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
neck this is a long scarf so it goes

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
neck this is a long scarf so it goes
about<00:02:11.220> three<00:02:11.580> times<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.840> take<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
about three times so I just take the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.430 
about three times so I just take the
scroll

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
scroll

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.060 
scroll
just<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.690> loop<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.900> around

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
just like this and I just loop it around

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.460 
just like this and I just loop it around
I'll<00:02:17.070> do<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.430> twice<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
I'll do it twice just like this and it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.200 
I'll do it twice just like this and it
does<00:02:19.650> make<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.040> very<00:02:20.130> chunky<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:20.940> thick

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
does make it very chunky and very thick

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.660 
does make it very chunky and very thick
