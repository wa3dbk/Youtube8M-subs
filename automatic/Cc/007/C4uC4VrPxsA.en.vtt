00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.890
 Click here for Kindle paper Japanese translation 2013 model year compared to the last year of the 2012 model year 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:16.500
 Screen contrast is first up and touch production accuracy is 19% 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:19.560
 Processing rate of 25% of the processor up and presented turning is now faster 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.110
 It means that it is faster than previous models 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.600
 so 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.740
 Click here to adjust the contrast You can adjust it soon 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.820
 I will 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:36.070
 It is great paper white I have several stones 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:41.020
 The Rutte that the accuracy of the touch sensor and still 19% accuracy up to great 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.590
 I tried touching last year's model, but I still feel that the spec is really great 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.450
 There is a sense of rising 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:53.580
 Here is an American ad, but it is 119 votes 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.059
 The Japanese model is cheaper The reason why it was easy in the case of the conventional model 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.510
 I 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.840
 Still it's really cheap I can get this for $ 119 119 I really feel good 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.230
 I think Do was 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.100
 Contrast makes whiter than white screen 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.000
 Black text has been kind to the very eyes not the place became more black 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:19.240
 Now N is the It is not particularly a Toko dissatisfaction point not perfect score 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.830
 It 's very nice that the feed is very fast and above all it can be read casually like this 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.920
 Fukui is o 2 like this 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 When this was compared now I'd have to read properly in this 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:34.190
 Of course, I think a little and I know here, et al. I'm not so much change 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.270
 After all, the sense of this open time The amount of information coming into the base at once and this one 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.420
 There are times when it comes to something a bit like something like a page, but that's why 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.820
 After all I think that this is 100 books 200 books 300 books 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.670
 Power 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.509
 It is very heavy If you think Tsu anymore 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.750
 This one is heavier when it comes to a book like this 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:57.600
 Because it's heavy, it hardly changes when it comes to this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 So here is the kind of Kindle Paper White highly recommended for those traveling 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.810
 I used to travel with backpacks, but I read this book for those who I met at that time 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.690
 It is better 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.250
 This book was about 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:13.690
 Nde Frequently I still can not teased and Once a note at the time, which had been due not 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.640
 You can prevent such a thing if you buy it on the spot soon to kindle 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.260
 Already then 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:24.680
 If you are told that you can read a book right away from the day, you don't have to go back to Japan 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:29.329
 Of course I can read books, but there are also bad things about e-books 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.609
 Is I think still Kotobukisono not read First When there is no more but this is hydrofluoric weekly charge 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.700
 It also has a strong design 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:40.159
 It has been written that what I really do not have to do for 10 years 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.670
 In the case of usb power supply from PC certainly 4 hours cormorants time also charging time this in 4 hours 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:49.349
 I can charge up to max so I really charge the PC in the rain 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:54.030
 I can read this by hand and it's highly recommended. 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:58.080
 I'm studying abroad, but it sounds like I want to call a Japanese book 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.430
 First of all, let me send you from amazon 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.510
 It is 3 to 4 days and time is in really seen you I'm I the lowest it takes absolute 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.959
 It will be over for a week if it is too late Reading a book I want to read when I want to read 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.910
 Is 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.450
 I think that is a great important thing I think I will never stop if I get drunk there 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.050
 Right? 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.760
 But I have a book recently 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.740
 As soon as I had bought it in kindle and read it all the time, this kind of Kindle paper 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.790
 It was very good to buy White 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.820
 Of course ipad iphone and android and that mac 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.070
 Even the windows can read kindle but still 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.040
 This is the light of convenience 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.670
 I think the ease is that I was a Kindle Paper White important cousin 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.969
 I tried to read it for another hour now 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:47.630
 Well it's such Bakka praise is incredible something I softening mother ship this here. 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:51.350
 It's a bit blurry, but this one is soon 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.730
 It is not immediately right now and this of the past 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.910
 Although it becomes a screen which becomes black because it decreases and refreshes once 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.290
 The previous model the press but it is do not clock 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.120
 Now it's black I'm a little dad when I slide the pump port 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.650
 It is this now black 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.330
 The kana become a little care that I mean Tsu refresh 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:16.380
 I did, but I do not feel at all when I usually suffer from Komoto 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:21.030
 Even if I read a book for a long time , my eyes won't hurt 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.600
 Well I wish wow this is better behind here I is written I amazon 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.200
 but 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.800
 Japan 2012 model was written here on Friday 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.350
 And I thought in my manner Do What do become a little cool towards the kindle 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:37.030
 Well mazon is good, but product which we use in Amazon 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:42.670
 Where companies use marking is to stand it a little one mountain of Tteyuu Na was close love 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.890
 It's really curry, so I think I 'll use it at this Ammer high so I 'm not going to add anything anymore 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:52.340
 People who are hurt or concerned 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:57.530
 I think that any good has changed whiff NiÃ±o course, while the people of the book is calling this by 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:02.690
 Ne of the still open this book is called doing anti-anti-here 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:07.340
 It's good that I read this book all the time since I've been here for many years 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:12.330
 I can not always be Finished reading the middle that's knack I'd 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:17.520
 It is not read until this part, it will be back to the bookshelf again, and it will be in a situation that will never stop 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:22.530
 It's all about storage before it sounds like it came in, so feel free to do something for a year 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.729
