note so using both an a or and the g18

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
note so using both an a or and the g18
is<00:00:58.050> impossible<00:00:58.739> unless<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.520> pick<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.910> up

from<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> battlefield<00:01:00.780> obviously<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.920> let's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
from the battlefield obviously so let's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
from the battlefield obviously so let's
take<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> look<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:02.940> trooper<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
take a look at this little trooper and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
take a look at this little trooper and
see<00:01:03.750> what's<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.110> great<00:01:04.379> about<00:01:04.439> him<00:01:04.799> well

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
see what's so great about him well

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
see what's so great about him well
taking<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> look<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.330> its<00:01:06.479> stats<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
taking a look at its stats we can see

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.670 
taking a look at its stats we can see
that<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> max<00:01:08.100> damage<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.729> 24<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:10.350> already

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that the max damage is 24 this already

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
that the max damage is 24 this already
plays<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> huge<00:01:11.400> factor<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:12.060> using<00:01:12.270> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
plays a huge factor when using this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.440 
plays a huge factor when using this
weapon<00:01:12.770> compared<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> g18<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.670> bf4<00:01:14.970> which

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
weapon compared to the g18 in bf4 which

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.350 
weapon compared to the g18 in bf4 which
only<00:01:15.750> dealt<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> maximum<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> 18<00:01:17.189> damage<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
only dealt a maximum of 18 damage this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
only dealt a maximum of 18 damage this
thing<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.810> instantly<00:01:19.650> better<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
thing is instantly better think of the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
thing is instantly better think of the
damage<00:01:21.479> being<00:01:21.720> roughly<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> same<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.100> Q

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
damage being roughly the same as the Q

damage being roughly the same as the Q
s-said<00:01:23.850> 92<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.810> bf4<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.619> Delta<00:01:26.009> 22<00:01:26.640> max

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
s-said 92 in bf4 which Delta 22 max
damage<00:01:27.210> having<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> look<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> accuracy<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
damage having a look at the accuracy of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.130 
damage having a look at the accuracy of
the<00:01:29.400> g18<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.810> pretty

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the g18 we can see that it is pretty

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
the g18 we can see that it is pretty
inaccurate<00:01:32.070> even<00:01:32.460> compared<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> bf4

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
inaccurate even compared to the bf4

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.289 
inaccurate even compared to the bf4
version<00:01:34.110> having<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.040> accuracy<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.549> 20<00:01:36.030> puts

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
version having the accuracy of 20 puts

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
version having the accuracy of 20 puts
the<00:01:36.509> g18<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> same<00:01:37.590> league<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> 93<00:01:39.000> or

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the g18 in the same league as the 93 or

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.539 
the g18 in the same league as the 93 or
now<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> g18<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.590> intended<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.100> close

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
now the g18 is intended for close

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.609 
now the g18 is intended for close
quarters<00:01:42.119> combat<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> overall<00:01:43.290> accuracy

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
quarters combat so the overall accuracy

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.490 
quarters combat so the overall accuracy
isn't<00:01:44.009> too<00:01:44.549> important<00:01:45.329> while<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.290> when

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
isn't too important while really when

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
isn't too important while really when
you<00:01:46.619> gun<00:01:46.799> fights<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> 70<00:01:47.939> hipfire<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
you gun fights is the 70 hipfire the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.270 
you gun fights is the 70 hipfire the
recode<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> weapon<00:01:49.799> has<00:01:49.920> been<00:01:50.100> altered

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
recode of the weapon has been altered

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.490 
recode of the weapon has been altered
slightly<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.720> should<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.079> roughly<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
slightly but it should have roughly the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
slightly but it should have roughly the
same<00:01:52.590> hipfire<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> date<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.759> battlefield<00:01:54.299> 4

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
same hipfire as a date in battlefield 4

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050 
same hipfire as a date in battlefield 4
the<00:01:55.290> range<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.740> quite<00:01:55.920> good<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.490> pistol<00:01:56.909> at

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the range is quite good for a pistol at

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.510 
the range is quite good for a pistol at
14<00:01:57.689> which<00:01:57.990> again<00:01:58.350> puts<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.979> par<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
14 which again puts it on par with the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.209 
14 which again puts it on par with the
93<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> range<00:02:01.350> shouldn't<00:02:01.920> play<00:02:02.070> an

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
93 or the range shouldn't play an

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.590 
93 or the range shouldn't play an
important<00:02:02.700> role<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.240> pistol

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
important role with this pistol

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
important role with this pistol
especially<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> recoil<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> kick

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
especially with the recoil and the kick

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
especially with the recoil and the kick
from<00:02:05.759> shooting<00:02:06.090> speaking<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
from shooting speaking of that the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.740 
from shooting speaking of that the
stability<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.009> kinda<00:02:08.459> low<00:02:08.610> at<00:02:08.849> 30<00:02:09.209> which<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
stability is kinda low at 30 which is

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.380 
stability is kinda low at 30 which is
somewhat<00:02:10.379> relative<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> deagle<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.700> bf4

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
somewhat relative to the deagle in bf4

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.240 
somewhat relative to the deagle in bf4
again

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
again

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.980 
again
it<00:02:13.400> shouldn't<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.910> problem<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.660> use<00:02:14.690> the
