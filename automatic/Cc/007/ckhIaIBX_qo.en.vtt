I'm<00:00:06.149> dr.<00:00:06.540> dan<00:00:06.689> from<00:00:06.839> Elvira<00:00:07.319> Pro<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.769> we're

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
I'm dr. dan from Elvira Pro and we're

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.980 
I'm dr. dan from Elvira Pro and we're
talking<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.370> little<00:00:08.490> bit<00:00:08.639> about<00:00:08.730> gala<00:00:09.510> we'll<00:00:09.870> do

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
talking a little bit about gala we'll do

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.519 
talking a little bit about gala we'll do
this<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> few<00:00:10.500> basics<00:00:11.070> here<00:00:11.280> now<00:00:12.350> gavel<00:00:13.350> is<00:00:13.410> a

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:13.529 
this a few basics here now gavel is a

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.590 
this a few basics here now gavel is a
principle<00:00:13.920> inhibitory<00:00:14.730> neurotransmitter

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
principle inhibitory neurotransmitter

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.679 
principle inhibitory neurotransmitter
for<00:00:15.930> our<00:00:16.049> brain<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.090> we<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.240> two<00:00:18.390> types

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
for our brain and we have two types

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.179 
for our brain and we have two types
excitatory<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.500> inhibitory

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
excitatory and inhibitory

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.929 
excitatory and inhibitory
and<00:00:20.340> think<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.179> as<00:00:21.390> brakes<00:00:21.749> and<00:00:21.990> gas<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.499> if

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
and think of it as brakes and gas so if

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.179 
and think of it as brakes and gas so if
the<00:00:23.939> inhibitory<00:00:24.560> neurotransmitters<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.769> put

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the inhibitory neurotransmitters are put

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.689 
the inhibitory neurotransmitters are put
on<00:00:26.339> the<00:00:26.429> brakes<00:00:26.669> and<00:00:27.409> the<00:00:28.409> excitatory<00:00:29.279> it's

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
on the brakes and the excitatory it's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
on the brakes and the excitatory it's
like<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.089> except<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> gas<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.949> there's

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
like a except on the gas so if there's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
like a except on the gas so if there's
anything<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.270> balance<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> your

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
anything out of balance here and your

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.510 
anything out of balance here and your
and<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:35.280> body<00:00:35.790> can't<00:00:36.210> regulate<00:00:36.870> gaba

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
and your body can't regulate gaba

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.630 
and your body can't regulate gaba
properly<00:00:38.630> then<00:00:39.630> you're<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.380> have<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:41.130> little

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
properly then you're gonna have a little

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.960 
properly then you're gonna have a little
bit<00:00:41.820> too<00:00:41.970> much<00:00:42.120> acceleration<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:44.790> know<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
bit too much acceleration and you know a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.670 
bit too much acceleration and you know a
few<00:00:45.330> brakes<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.780> work<00:00:45.900> right<00:00:46.200> you're<00:00:46.500> going

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
few brakes don't work right you're going

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.330 
few brakes don't work right you're going
to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.920> trouble

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to be in trouble

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.070 
to be in trouble
because<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> first<00:00:48.720> thing<00:00:48.960> you

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
because you know the first thing you

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.260 
because you know the first thing you
have<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.290> do<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.650> given<00:00:49.890> build<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.100> racecar<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
have to do for given build a racecar is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.580 
have to do for given build a racecar is
you're<00:00:51.600> gonna<00:00:51.720> have<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.080> have<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.350> brakes

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you're gonna have to have good brakes

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.370 
you're gonna have to have good brakes
because<00:00:53.540> you<00:00:54.540> know<00:00:54.630> burning<00:00:54.900> brakes<00:00:55.170> out

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
because you know burning brakes out

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.140 
because you know burning brakes out
there<00:00:55.800> race<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> pretty<00:00:56.310> much<00:00:56.490> over<00:00:56.790> for<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
there race is pretty much over for you

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.680 
there race is pretty much over for you
so<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.820> why<00:01:00.090> gaba<00:01:00.360> is<00:01:00.540> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
so you know that's why gaba is so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900 
so you know that's why gaba is so
important<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.520> understanding<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.610> little<00:01:02.820> bit

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
important and understanding a little bit

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.999 
important and understanding a little bit
about<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.630> help<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.079> to<00:01:04.259> choose<00:01:04.500> foods<00:01:04.829> a

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
about it will help you to choose foods a

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.859 
about it will help you to choose foods a
little<00:01:05.070> bit<00:01:05.280> better<00:01:05.450> maybe<00:01:06.450> choose<00:01:06.720> some

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
little bit better maybe choose some

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
little bit better maybe choose some
supplements<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.770> help<00:01:07.920> regulate<00:01:08.220> gaba

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
supplements that will help regulate gaba

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.820 
supplements that will help regulate gaba
so<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.870> your<00:01:10.050> brain<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.650> proper

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so that that your brain can be in proper

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.860 
so that that your brain can be in proper
balance<00:01:10.950> you'll<00:01:11.490> sleep<00:01:11.790> better<00:01:11.870> annually

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
balance you'll sleep better annually

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.500 
balance you'll sleep better annually
even<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.380> better<00:01:13.530> energy<00:01:13.980> during<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.310> day<00:01:14.510> so

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
even a better energy during the day so

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.740 
even a better energy during the day so
why<00:01:15.810> might<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.230> person<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.750> problems

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
why might a person has some problems

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.930 
why might a person has some problems
with<00:01:19.140> gaba<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> first<00:01:20.280> place<00:01:20.490> well

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
with gaba in the first place well

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.610 
with gaba in the first place well
anything<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.659> causes<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.470> brain

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
anything that causes any kind of brain

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.580 
anything that causes any kind of brain
inflammation<00:01:23.060> can<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.600> typically<00:01:25.260> affect

inflammation can can typically affect

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
inflammation can can typically affect
gaba<00:01:25.800> as<00:01:25.979> well<00:01:26.190> now<00:01:26.909> brain<00:01:27.150> inflammation<00:01:27.390> can

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
gaba as well now brain inflammation can

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
gaba as well now brain inflammation can
you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.800> probably<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.159> list<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you know it's probably a list of a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.430 
you know it's probably a list of a
thousand<00:01:29.940> things<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.540> through<00:01:30.720> but

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
thousand things we could go through but

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.610 
thousand things we could go through but
it's<00:01:31.740> best<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> say<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.320> any

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
it's best is to say that you know any

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's best is to say that you know any
insult<00:01:35.190> from<00:01:35.700> chemical<00:01:36.409> contamination<00:01:37.409> in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
insult from chemical contamination in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.800 
insult from chemical contamination in
the<00:01:37.830> environment<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.090> heavy<00:01:39.330> metals

can certainly have an impact and
corsican<00:01:45.479> diet<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> when<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> always<00:01:47.610> recommend

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
corsican diet so when I always recommend

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
corsican diet so when I always recommend
of<00:01:48.240> course<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.900> choose<00:01:49.170> organically

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
of course is that you choose organically

you<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> vote<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.439> few<00:02:01.530> times<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> decade<00:02:02.520> at

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you get to vote a few times a decade at

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
you get to vote a few times a decade at
the<00:02:02.850> polls<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.080> vote<00:02:04.229> every<00:02:04.380> day

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the polls but you get to vote every day

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.609 
the polls but you get to vote every day
with<00:02:04.830> your<00:02:05.010> dollar<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.720> if<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> want

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
with your dollar so you know if you want

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.190 
with your dollar so you know if you want
to<00:02:07.710> see<00:02:07.830> more<00:02:08.069> healthy<00:02:08.670> choices<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.659> buy

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
to see more healthy choices then buy

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.120 
to see more healthy choices then buy
those<00:02:10.909> so<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:13.110> other<00:02:13.260> thing<00:02:13.530> he<00:02:13.709> has<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.830> do

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
those so the other thing he has to do

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.670 
those so the other thing he has to do
with<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.700> specific<00:02:15.450> dietary<00:02:15.990> thing

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
with the specific dietary thing

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.520 
with the specific dietary thing
now<00:02:16.980> when<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:18.030> see<00:02:18.270> brain<00:02:18.630> inflammation<00:02:18.870> one

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
now when we see brain inflammation one

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.290 
now when we see brain inflammation one
of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.650> first<00:02:19.830> things<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.220> always<00:02:20.400> ask<00:02:21.000> about

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
of the first things we always ask about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.870 
of the first things we always ask about
is<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.650> person<00:02:22.710> gluten<00:02:23.310> sensitive

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
is is this person gluten sensitive

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.840 
is is this person gluten sensitive
because<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.750> lot<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.260> people<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.700> all

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
because a lot of people are and it's all

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
because a lot of people are and it's all
another<00:02:27.030> topic<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:30.120> there

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
another topic but you know it's there

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.730 
another topic but you know it's there
are<00:02:31.020> some<00:02:31.970> antibodies<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.500> into

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
are some antibodies that can get into

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.190 
are some antibodies that can get into
your<00:02:34.830> brain<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.570> inhibit<00:02:36.570> certain<00:02:36.750> enzyme

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
your brain and inhibit certain enzyme

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.930 
your brain and inhibit certain enzyme
pathways<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.070> then<00:02:38.460> we'll<00:02:38.670> certainly

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
pathways and then we'll certainly

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
pathways and then we'll certainly
disrupt<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.660> gala<00:02:39.900> balance<00:02:40.410> we've<00:02:40.650> seen<00:02:40.860> that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
disrupt the gala balance we've seen that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.980 
disrupt the gala balance we've seen that
happen<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.430> lot<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.970> there's<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.720> lot<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
happen a lot and there's a lot of

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.050 
happen a lot and there's a lot of
scientific<00:02:43.230> literature<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.400> so

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
scientific literature to back that up so

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
scientific literature to back that up so
just<00:02:45.900> know<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.770> you're<00:02:47.010> having<00:02:47.250> brand

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
just know that if you're having brand

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.460 
just know that if you're having brand
inflammation<00:02:48.120> getting<00:02:48.780> gluten<00:02:49.020> tested

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
inflammation getting gluten tested

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.110 
inflammation getting gluten tested
properly<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.490> walk<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.760> through

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
properly and we can walk you through

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.080 
properly and we can walk you through
that<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> good<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> good<00:02:53.490> plan

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
that is a good is a good plan

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.150 
that is a good is a good plan
now<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.780> blends<00:02:55.410> out<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> only<00:02:55.920> food

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
now that that blends out the only food

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.130 
now that that blends out the only food
we<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.120> other<00:02:57.300> testing<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:57.960> like

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
we have some other testing that we like

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.900 
we have some other testing that we like
to<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.560> well<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.490> attest<00:03:00.030> common<00:03:00.840> foods<00:03:01.910> go

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
to do as well to attest common foods go

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.510 
to do as well to attest common foods go
through<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> list<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:05.370> you're

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
through the list but you know if you're

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.340 
through the list but you know if you're
having<00:03:05.580> brain<00:03:06.060> inflammation<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.930> need<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
having brain inflammation you need to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.780 
having brain inflammation you need to
look<00:03:07.470> at<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.800> now<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.580> far<00:03:08.730> as

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
look at that now as far as

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.880 
look at that now as far as
supplementation<00:03:09.630> goes<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.470> are<00:03:10.680> some

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
supplementation goes there are some

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.410 
supplementation goes there are some
things<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.160> can<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.240> will

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
things you can do that all of that will

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.860 
things you can do that all of that will
be<00:03:12.450> very<00:03:12.810> helpful<00:03:13.080> for<00:03:13.530> your<00:03:13.740> GABA<00:03:14.700> balance<00:03:15.180> if

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
be very helpful for your GABA balance if

if there is deficient and of course we

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.440 
if there is deficient and of course we

three phenyl uric acid and that crosses
blood-brain<00:04:04.530> barrier<00:04:04.560> three<00:04:05.220> nicely<00:04:05.670> as<00:04:05.820> this

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
blood-brain barrier three nicely as this

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.630 
blood-brain barrier three nicely as this
taurine<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.670> it's<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.400> it's<00:04:11.550> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
taurine and it's a you know it's a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.830 
taurine and it's a you know it's a
gamify<00:04:12.150> product<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.070> so<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:15.060> also<00:04:15.270> helps<00:04:15.570> to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
gamify product and so it also helps to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.280 
gamify product and so it also helps to
to<00:04:16.530> regulate<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.489> gaba<00:04:17.760> receptors<00:04:18.390> now<00:04:18.930> I

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
to regulate the gaba receptors now I

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.960 
to regulate the gaba receptors now I
mentioned<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:19.950> blood-brain<00:04:20.430> barrier<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
mentioned that blood-brain barrier and

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.750 
mentioned that blood-brain barrier and
that<00:04:21.290> brings<00:04:22.290> up<00:04:22.440> another<00:04:22.530> topic<00:04:22.920> that<00:04:23.190> if

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
that brings up another topic that if

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.090 
that brings up another topic that if
you're<00:04:24.180> taking<00:04:24.630> gaba<00:04:24.900> because<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:25.800> order

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
you're taking gaba because you can order

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.490 
you're taking gaba because you can order
just

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
just

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.850 
just
or<00:04:27.620> gala<00:04:28.360> from<00:04:29.440> different<00:04:30.440> sources<00:04:30.710> and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
or gala from different sources and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.280 
or gala from different sources and
capsules<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.700> if<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.480> some<00:04:32.870> people<00:04:33.140> feel

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
capsules and if you some people feel

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.110 
capsules and if you some people feel
quite<00:04:33.590> quite<00:04:34.160> mellow<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.640> they<00:04:34.730> take<00:04:34.940> that

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
quite quite mellow and they take that

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.300 
quite quite mellow and they take that
now<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.840> indicates<00:04:36.320> two<00:04:36.530> problems<00:04:37.040> number

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
now that indicates two problems number

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.520 
now that indicates two problems number
one<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.940> if<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.180> take<00:04:38.390> GABA<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.050> you

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
one is that if you take GABA and you

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.940 
one is that if you take GABA and you
notice<00:04:39.890> anything<00:04:40.250> at<00:04:40.610> all<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:42.440> have<00:04:42.890> a

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
notice anything at all then you have a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.370 
notice anything at all then you have a
GABA<00:04:43.280> deficiency<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.900> also<00:04:45.080> have<00:04:45.350> a

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
GABA deficiency but you also have a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.540 
GABA deficiency but you also have a
problem<00:04:45.530> with<00:04:45.800> your<00:04:45.890> blood-brain<00:04:46.520> barrier

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
problem with your blood-brain barrier

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.670 
problem with your blood-brain barrier
because<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.600> should<00:04:47.870> not<00:04:48.110> get<00:04:48.260> into<00:04:48.500> your

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
because that should not get into your

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.190 
because that should not get into your
brain<00:04:48.890> so<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:50.210> should<00:04:50.360> just<00:04:50.480> be<00:04:50.540> metabolized

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
brain so that should just be metabolized

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.890 
brain so that should just be metabolized
in<00:04:51.320> your<00:04:51.440> body<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.060> turned<00:04:53.060> into<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.720> its

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
in your body and turned into it to its

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.130 
in your body and turned into it to its
basic<00:04:54.350> components<00:04:54.670> so<00:04:55.670> you<00:04:56.660> know<00:04:56.810> if<00:04:56.960> you

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
basic components so you know if you

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.680 
basic components so you know if you
notice<00:04:57.470> anything<00:04:57.680> from<00:04:57.890> taking<00:04:58.220> GABA<00:04:58.690> you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
notice anything from taking GABA you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.840 
notice anything from taking GABA you
know<00:04:59.840> just<00:05:00.770> taking<00:05:01.130> it's<00:05:01.250> not<00:05:01.430> going<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.669> help

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
know just taking it's not going to help

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
component here is that if you're having

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.480 
component here is that if you're having
gaba<00:05:42.110> issues<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:42.590> probably<00:05:42.979> also<00:05:43.160> have<00:05:43.280> in

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
gaba issues you probably also have in

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.210 
gaba issues you probably also have in
serotonin<00:05:44.150> issues<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:45.110> you're<00:05:45.560> in<00:05:45.890> order<00:05:46.160> to

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
serotonin issues and you're in order to

get the proper result that you want here

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.710 
get the proper result that you want here
you<00:05:49.190> most<00:05:49.760> likely<00:05:50.000> gonna<00:05:50.210> have<00:05:50.390> to<00:05:50.510> supplement

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
you most likely gonna have to supplement

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.820 
you most likely gonna have to supplement
with<00:05:51.169> something<00:05:51.770> like<00:05:51.979> serine<00:05:52.550> from<00:05:53.830> tor

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
with something like serine from tor

traffic or both from neuroscience those

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.610 
traffic or both from neuroscience those
can<00:05:57.620> help<00:05:58.180> achieve<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.419> that<00:06:00.020> inhibitory

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
can help achieve that that inhibitory

can help achieve that that inhibitory
balance<00:06:01.040> that<00:06:01.160> you're<00:06:01.280> looking<00:06:01.520> for<00:06:02.020> so

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
balance that you're looking for so

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.930 
balance that you're looking for so
anyway<00:06:04.580> that's<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:06.320> basics<00:06:06.770> on<00:06:06.950> gaba<00:06:07.640> and

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
anyway that's the the basics on gaba and
