00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.900
 hello everyone in this video 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:09.059
 I'll tell you how to remove drivers correctly 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 your video card 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.930
 Putin's and Nvidia or companies ati radeon 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.390
 firstly the first way to correct 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.150
 deleting it as firewood installed new 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.750
 driver utility installing firewood 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.030
 automatically prompts you to remove 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:34.140
 old here let's say ati 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.140
 radeon run the program 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.329
 first and foremost the language further and 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:45.670
 she removes install delete click 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.829
 delete and all deletes reboot 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.699
 computer and nvidia in my opinion too 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.960
 there is such a thing also possible 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.729
 delete via control panel 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.929
 the installing and deleting of programms 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.089
 start the program control panel and 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.100
 Components 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.390
 This one for the company MGR 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.270
 radeon video cards will be like this 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.190
 Entry md rolled on the table and the manager 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 for and nvidia 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.830
 the driver's view has become this second option 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.060
 right click change select 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.720
 hotel and now we load 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.910
 installable 3 using the third 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.390
 way with the help of the program which is 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.390
 on our website 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.210
 is called on the driver sweeper ssylochku and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.210
 snow removal 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:51.539
 so swing it and run accordingly 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:54.000
 I run here too 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.619
 setting up just to madness despite 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.659
 the fact that it is completely in English 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.969
 and m d display that is, respectively 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:11.450
 video as a driver for a video card n.d. 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:14.790
 ati radeon asus an nvidia display this 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.920
 video card nvidia chipset likely 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.870
 the motherboard is therefore better 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.660
 everywhere do not tick if we want 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.819
 give exactly the driver 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.799
 if md click ppm IS-7 video 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:32.400
 click and nvidia display and click 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.130
 wedge is simple or can be analyzed 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.840
 you can immediately select and that is all 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 just chose the analysis removed 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.760
 reboot installed new all 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.079
 thanks attention focus on this all 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.620
 until next 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.620
 bake
