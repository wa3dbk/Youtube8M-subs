00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
like a methodical style that's how I've

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
like a methodical style that's how I've
always<00:00:49.949> been<00:00:50.219> since<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:50.789> kid<00:00:50.999> I<00:00:51.359> like

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
always been since I was a kid I like

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.239 
always been since I was a kid I like
used<00:00:52.109> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.739> practice

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
used to do like the same practice

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.559 
used to do like the same practice
session<00:00:53.609> every<00:00:53.819> day<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.390> same

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
session every day and like the same

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.719 
session every day and like the same
chicks<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.079> same<00:00:55.319> order<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
chicks in the same order which is just

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.969 
chicks in the same order which is just
natural<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.449> something<00:00:57.890> over<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
natural when you do something over and

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.139 
natural when you do something over and
over<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.429> get<00:00:59.670> better<00:00:59.789> at<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
over you're gonna get better at it you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
over you're gonna get better at it you
know<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
know so I think that's one of the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.349 
know so I think that's one of the
reasons<00:01:02.280> where<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.639> to<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> skating

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
reasons where I got to get it skating

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
reasons where I got to get it skating
just<00:01:03.569> like<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.620> really<00:01:04.739> exact<00:01:05.129> like

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just like then I can really exact like

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.889 
just like then I can really exact like
that<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> practicing<00:01:06.149> my<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.479> chicks<00:01:06.750> over

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
that and practicing my same chicks over

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.450 
that and practicing my same chicks over
and<00:01:07.140> over<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.439> over<00:01:07.680> until<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.219> really

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and over and over until I got I'm really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
and over and over until I got I'm really
good<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:09.960> why<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.229> style

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
good and I was probably why my style

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.030 
good and I was probably why my style
still<00:01:10.979> shows<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.399> now

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.499 

I<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.850> myself<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.299> being
