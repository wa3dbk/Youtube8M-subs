 hiding 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.849
 conventional code lock gas tank 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.179
 discovery performed with the help of ordinary 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.630
 hard metal 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.180
 with the side surface 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 main body resulting hole 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 put rejected a mustache hit it very 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 soft broke it took a lot 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.010
 less time by five minutes than time 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 spent on search code 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 Moreover, setting the correct code is still 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.570
 does not guarantee that the lock will open as 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 memorize them hadith quite old very 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.129
 you need to very carefully put himself 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.699
 lock mechanism consists of a main 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:09.350
 housing with holes represented by such 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:11.420
 a buoy on a spring follows kruglyash 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 serif 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 one diameter 1 notch larger 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.700
 diameter in which, respectively, falls 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.189
 when exhibiting 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.890
 fer bulat buoy 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.670
 This ruble meets for combination codes 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.359
 I will pay a fee leaving super blat 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 serifs of the main body 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:48.450
 followed by a dial with a code mechanism 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:56.829
 2 code combinations are this internal 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:02:01.140
 kruglyash saw misfire buoy gets here in 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.140
 this hole itself does not move either 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.519
 accordingly, it stops right here 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:17.190
 falls as you move the experience of the inner 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:20.500
 circle by digit code combination 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.370
 respectively, the castle does not bathe and 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.370
 opens
