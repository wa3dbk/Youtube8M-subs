00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.580
 good friends here we have a very good portfolio 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.180
 pretty for this winter season and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.780
 for this portfolio we need a base 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.490
 a 22 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.090
 three skeins of thread one in brown 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:27.250
 one honey color and one color tan and 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.250
 a pair of brown handles 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.040
 after having given two laps of 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.860
 half point all the outline of the base 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.969
 let's take out the spike point of this 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.969
 way 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.969
 we go down 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.470
 We speak 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:53.350
 we play a half point without finishing 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:56.950
 up 1 we have 1 2 and 3 in the third 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.400
 we go down again we raise and we have 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.800
 four points in the brooch we close it 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.260
 all 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.950
 we closed and left two midpoints 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.310
 followed 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.310
 one 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.320
 and 2 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.780
 back off 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.399
 low bad in the same place wherever 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 that the other raised half a point and I go back 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.020
 to go down in the third 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.250
 raised and I get four points in the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.250
 courage close 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.580
 I return to weave the half points 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.190
 followed 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.980
 all the outline of the base we are going to 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.680
 work it that way back under 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.980
 in the same place as the previous one and 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:59.100
 I raise half a point I come back down in the 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:01.240
 third and halo I raise the 4 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.210
 I close 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.780
 I return to get two half points 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.780
 followed 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.780
 and so I have to give the whole outline of 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.959
 the base at the same point 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.000
 to see friends we have finished giving a 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.390
 back with the point we will continue in the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.960
 second round with the same color 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 we play 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.540
 a half point 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.600
 with half a point and two other means 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.530
 consecutive points 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.530
 low 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.100
 halo 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.230
 where closed dust draw the half point 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.230
 and low with the center 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.530
 to get the 4 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.530
 I close 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.040
 and I return to weave the two half points 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.040
 followed 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.060
 under again the same place where 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.770
 I took the previous one 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.770
 in the same suit site 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.550
 I raise again half a point 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.550
 under again the center and lift 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.230
 all the girlfriends back we're going to give them and 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.750
 so that our team could be this way 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.790
 way then asks are you going to take it like this 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.319
 do not forget men is every color I follow 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.319

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.780
 and all these materials we 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.780

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.060
 again we raise all 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.060
 we close 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.750
 as 200 wounds 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.470
 no no 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:40.150
 if we work all the contour all the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.150
 return of the base of our portfolio 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.050
 the whole round we work to do with this 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.139
 point 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:59.650
 closing taking two half points 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.650
 followed and down everything 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.340
 we raise 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.510
 we go 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.960

 the two points in brown dot 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:30.889
 spike let's change thread with the 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.780
 beige we get two half points 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.080
 followed 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.080
 if I step back under the center 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.060
 I raise 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.060
 I take out a half point 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.270
 and went down again to the center 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.830
 I raise and it happened all 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.150
 I close 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.900
 I have again the average points 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.900
 followed 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.990

 I raise and there I have the 4 close 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.780
 and I keep taking the half point 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.520
 without adjusting much so that they do not have 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.940
 difficulty pulling 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:43.950
