the back these transmissions aren't very
cheap<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.649> I<00:01:11.660> wanted<00:01:12.660> an<00:01:12.780> overdrive<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
cheap but I wanted an overdrive so I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
cheap but I wanted an overdrive so I
would<00:01:15.000> grit<00:01:15.270> our<00:01:15.420> teeth<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.930> send<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.440> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
would grit our teeth and send up a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.219 
would grit our teeth and send up a
little<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.920> money<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:20.729> had<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.660> cut

little bit of money I had to cut

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
little bit of money I had to cut
floorboards<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.160> it's<00:01:23.340> two<00:01:23.580> wheel<00:01:23.789> drive

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.029 
floorboards because it's two wheel drive
truck<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.289> wheel<00:01:25.470> drive<00:01:25.500> truck

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and and it wouldn't fit so we had to cut

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
and and it wouldn't fit so we had to cut
around<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.570> we'd<00:01:33.690> fit<00:01:33.930> down<00:01:34.080> in<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.440> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
around it so we'd fit down in there and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.070 
around it so we'd fit down in there and
I've<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> couple<00:01:35.130> pieces<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.720> full<00:01:36.720> board

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
threaded it's kind of like a brake line

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.789 
threaded it's kind of like a brake line
and<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:29.489> just<00:02:30.390> can't<00:02:30.660> seem<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.110> figure<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.620> how

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
and I just can't seem to figure out how

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.800 
and I just can't seem to figure out how
to<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.400> run<00:02:32.610> down<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.329> my<00:02:33.450> slave

to get it to run down to my slave
cylinder<00:02:34.940> which<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> Chrysler<00:02:37.280> application

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
cylinder which is a Chrysler application

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.420 
cylinder which is a Chrysler application
right<00:02:38.430> here

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
right here

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.040 
right here
it's<00:02:41.430> got<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.850> hole<00:02:42.120> right<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.480> and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's got a little hole right there and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.140 
it's got a little hole right there and
this<00:02:43.770> right<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.820> would<00:02:45.030> be

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
this right here it's not this would be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.100 
this right here it's not this would be
on<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> line<00:02:45.980> but<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.700> bought<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.210> the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
on a line but I just bought that the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.780 
on a line but I just bought that the
feeding<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.920> would<00:02:50.040> go<00:02:50.250> down<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.640> there

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
feeding but it would go down in there

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.030 
feeding but it would go down in there
like<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.450> here

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
like this right here

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.470 
like this right here
and<00:02:53.040> you'll<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.520> pushing<00:02:53.790> down<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.330> there

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
this thing down in there and then you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.310 
this thing down in there and then you
put<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> little<00:03:00.240> key<00:03:00.480> through<00:03:00.780> there<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.200> it'll

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
line and I knew it wouldn't work but I'm

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.590 
line and I knew it wouldn't work but I'm
trying<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:13.740> figure<00:03:13.980> out<00:03:14.190> how<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.460> can<00:03:14.850> either

splice half of the Dodge line to it or

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.200 
splice half of the Dodge line to it or
if<00:03:19.380> somebody<00:03:19.890> makes<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.900> conversion<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:22.230> this

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
if somebody makes a conversion like this

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.940 
if somebody makes a conversion like this

but kind of hoping I can beat everybody
to<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.270> before<00:03:48.450> someone<00:03:49.230> starts<00:03:49.590> doing<00:03:49.980> one<00:03:50.100> of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
to it before someone starts doing one of

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.760 
to it before someone starts doing one of
these<00:03:51.890> but<00:03:53.870> as<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.020> right<00:03:55.050> now<00:03:55.230> I'm<00:03:55.590> at<00:03:55.740> a

these but as of right now I'm at a

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.970 
these but as of right now I'm at a
standstill<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:57.320> can't<00:03:58.320> really<00:03:58.530> drive<00:03:58.740> it

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
standstill on that can't really drive it

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.470 
standstill on that can't really drive it
anywhere<00:03:59.160> even<00:03:59.340> though<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> did<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.270> other<00:04:00.360> day

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
anywhere even though I did the other day

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.070 
anywhere even though I did the other day
I<00:04:01.310> didn't<00:04:02.310> really<00:04:02.550> want<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.030> but<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.390> wanted<00:04:04.020> to

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
I didn't really want to but I wanted to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.950 
I didn't really want to but I wanted to
see<00:04:04.260> how<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.620> would<00:04:04.740> drive<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:05.810> started<00:04:06.810> in

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
see how it would drive but I started in

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.070 
see how it would drive but I started in
first<00:04:07.230> gear<00:04:08.060> goes<00:04:09.060> around<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> yard<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.840> little

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
first gear goes around the yard a little

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.780 
first gear goes around the yard a little
bit<00:04:12.140> tore<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.410> little<00:04:13.620> bit<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.070> yard<00:04:14.370> but

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
bit tore up a little bit of the yard but

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.950 
bit tore up a little bit of the yard but
I<00:04:15.030> got<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.600> detour<00:04:16.049> locker<00:04:16.290> in<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> rear<00:04:16.799> end

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:17.960 
I got a detour locker in the rear end

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.030 
I got a detour locker in the rear end
but<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:20.220> drives<00:04:20.549> good<00:04:21.500> straight<00:04:22.500> pop<00:04:22.800> right

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
but it drives good straight pop right

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
but it drives good straight pop right
now<00:04:23.420> turned<00:04:24.420> out<00:04:24.780> over<00:04:25.260> here<00:04:25.670> just<00:04:26.670> coming

sitting right here

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:51.200 
sitting right here
now<00:04:37.720> start<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.170> up<00:04:38.260> for<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.620> let's<00:04:38.830> listen<00:04:39.160> to

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.309 

it<00:04:51.840> was<00:04:52.080> an<00:04:52.289> automatic<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.160> my<00:04:54.080> sister<00:04:55.080> still

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
it was an automatic and my sister still

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.240 
it was an automatic and my sister still
here<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> gotta<00:04:55.949> take<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.220> out<00:04:56.580> still<00:04:58.250> but

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
here I gotta take it out still but

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.809 
here I gotta take it out still but
that'll<00:05:02.250> be<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.400> little<00:05:02.580> bit<00:05:02.759> later<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:04.819> wait
