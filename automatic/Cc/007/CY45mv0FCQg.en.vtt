00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
years and the five-year MRI is actually

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
years and the five-year MRI is actually
only<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.240> doctor<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
only going to be for the doctor to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.980 
only going to be for the doctor to
therefore<00:01:25.710> improve<00:01:26.640> her<00:01:26.909> practice<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.840> has

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
therefore improve her practice so it has

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.030 
therefore improve her practice so it has
nothing<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.979> him<00:01:30.079> having<00:01:31.079> any<00:01:31.350> health

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
nothing to do with him having any health

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.850 
nothing to do with him having any health
concerns<00:01:32.360> for<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.780> need<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.200> check<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.710> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
concerns for them to need to check up in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.210 
concerns for them to need to check up in
five<00:01:35.070> years<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.549> merely<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.240> improving

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
five years it's merely for improving

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.940 
five years it's merely for improving
future<00:01:38.220> surgical<00:01:39.000> procedures<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.720> he's<00:01:40.710> done
