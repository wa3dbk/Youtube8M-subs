00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
all other in it let's see what

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.690 
all other in it let's see what
up<00:03:07.780> sausage<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.830> lot<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.100> times<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.550> have

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
up sausage a lot of times can have

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.860 
up sausage a lot of times can have
gluten<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.690> watch

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
gluten in it so you're going to watch

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.520
