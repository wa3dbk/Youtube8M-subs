00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.390
 or a little bit loose without possibilities 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.940
 clear little goal and dynamic 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.580
 the second time changes everything faster 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.039
 more space here began alliance with 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.230
 ramps and albarracín as it appears by the 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.609
 figure alliance enabling jordi queen 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.740
 and he's going to fight him to the end with 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.240
 johnny b the encounter not nearly 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.160
 chance 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.080
 turns the alliance forward the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.280
 first of alliance that came out with another 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.810
 institution time 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.670
 it came out more precise as in mobility and 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.670
 found starting second time this 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.230
 jordi queen goal that will tie 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.970
 peaceful an output a good move 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.040
 pacific structure 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.650
 playing very well that ball giving rebound 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.930
 forsythe a center to pérez that just 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.970
 had entered the number 9 pérez it 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.710
 find the center of mendoza only 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.590
 he has to play alliance in the background 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.080
 that seems to leave many doubts in the 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.480
 marks above all inattention in alliance 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.239
 to the center of mendoza voley the draw is 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.030
 Perez peaceful as we discussed 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.159
 Excite peaceful goes the attack 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.110
 many men in peaceful attack not 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.110
 will seek to comply with the expulsion of 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.700
 because we did not see it as an action for 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.979
 take out red card goes down true yes 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 he wins the chávez position but I 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.390
 it seems that the red is excessive 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.520
 uribe since he will live on the counter as 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.610
 grab badly stopped to peaceful many 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 spaces back will find it peaceful 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.730
 newly admitted vidales 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 all the space in the world 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.240
 to be able to decide never to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.070
 at the close the pacific defender with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.650
 the awkward one lets him finish 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.540
 quietly and puts it up good 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.790
 definition of life the defender comes out 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.710
 it covered the possibility of 15 but not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.140
 there was room for space because 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 he only gets there what he has to do 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.970
 defender is wrong not to close and accuse him 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.350
 to prevent it from being auctioned, it is not 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.009
 it is but it had the possible time and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.009
 live
