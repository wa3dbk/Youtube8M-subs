 Want in not a fake you will find a first round of Birogu 2014 guy go Kinki Yaya' 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.930
 I think that 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.590
 4 It's also the first time in the vilog 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.869
 I have it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:35.720
 I just started for the first time moving the beauty Rogutanguru 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.720
 About one month it started in between after the December 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:45.380
 Every day every day 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.700
 I was slightly off by the last minute but almost every 1 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:56.060
 Hey it would have been if I tried to raise 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:04.100
 The real is to Paa up low Ya' Well it is me was really fun to try for a month 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:09.690
 For those who want to see because it becomes in the middle of the night for me also the world while I think Naa would be very 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 I did has become considerably at night type by Tteyuu-flops load edited in the middle of the night 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:19.380
 To tell you what you thought of that day in real time is that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.750
 I think it's good, but maybe it will be 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.360
 It may be a bit like thinking about moving one day, so it may be good 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.710
 What I thought was 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.520
 This is the night came back to the house every day 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.720
 If I take + when will I go to read 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.960
 Hume's 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.650
 I feel anxious I can't get in, that's a joke 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.010
 Yes 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:52.120
 Maybe this month because it was box with a serious part There is also like a feeling 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.930
 I think I would do it in the same way, but it might be a bit 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.600
 It may change the way, yes 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 But if you're really doing a month and you're the main channel 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.380
 here 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.120
 I have not done it 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.850
 Registration 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.880
 I wonder if it entered 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.069
 10,400 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.400
 200 people 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.549
 Thanks 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.440
 Hey is amazing happy 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:30.159
 If you have so many people registered in a month 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:35.220
 I thought it would start to be more public interest, but there are people who can see this way 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:41.040
 In as I was accustomed to feeling that I think Fu say trying to do 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.020
 Well, thanks to everyone What kind of New Year holidays did you meet? 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.540
 I 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.689
 After a long time 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.550
 That was in what whether such a laid-back house 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.520
 It's been a while since I never remember it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.940
 It was beyond the year 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.350
 so 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.770
 I saw this year the red and white do not look at all every year 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.050
 That's Tteyuu was something interesting I was interesting is 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.170
 Haruka Ayase's view was interesting 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.910
 Haruka Ayase 's nice feeling 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.080
 I'm great 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.480
 Possible 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:23.560
 It's not a calculation but a killer feeling 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.090
 I was watching it thinking like it would be 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.350
 so 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.380
 What is it? 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.600
 It was a double cherry blossom 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.280
 She is starring with Aidem 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.700
 I forgot the name but that 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.170
 Dried fish woman of guy 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.410
 My sister showed good but the girl is the hero of the main character of the dried woman's drama 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.450
 That character is also great me 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.530
 I forgot but I liked it 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.190
 Hey 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.819
 It was created while thinking like it was a wonderful girl 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.900
 The 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:06.270
 And softening Tteyuu here also being fearful pounding 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:11.070
 Somewhat advanced feelings 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:16.560
 I think I do not know at all if you look at the red and white but not the people who look at the red and white 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:21.180
 It looks like you're watching a variety show until the end 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:25.360
 That's right, I became a talking language, but how did everyone do a little 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.970
 I'm close after seeing mud regular red and white 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.500
 We went to Maruyama 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.449
 Great intense day 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:43.249
 Nde something was dangerous about Ketteyuu was side-by-side so every year 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:52.339
 I went to another place one little bitty also there give up But Okkii temple to Anne to give up 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:55.440
 Kedomo there also I still that hair growth in I came back without eventually Hatsumode decline you fish in the matrix Day 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:05:01.050
 Of even the Well Nde Rashiki it is not yet in 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:06.660
 It is I Mitan even after Hatsuyume so I think the Fu it 's such a do you go Do 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:12.380
 What a wonderful dream like that u 65 scene changes 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:18.390
 I had a dream , but I have already returned to Facebook 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:22.600
 Anyway , I'm not alone, I always say a car and someone 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.960
 The colon is really like the best corn to roll 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.800
 I know pretend that there is such he entered softened accident 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.350
 This time someone is taken by hand 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.700
 Pervert 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:42.070
 At that time put in place like a hospital of swearing 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:50.410
 I can see Kochi Castle on the upper side but I can not go out and try to go out 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:52.360
 It is made not to let something dirty run out now, and then something is taken underwater. 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.720
 Take it from above 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:04.449
 Something taken in the camera and something in the pool in the water 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:08.319
 It is not unusual or painful and uplifting feeling I feel comfortable 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:12.020
 Put hot water and then why is it 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:18.110

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:29.360
 A dream that you feel like you are there and you don't want to admit it 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:34.520
 I'm Tanto, did you have your first dream 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:38.080
 Only say I swim a little in the pool at something dream divination is Kedomo I saw a little 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:43.629
 Something seems to be fairly stable 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:52.150
 I think it 's good because it was a good content, I think it's yes 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:54.419
