the<00:02:37.840> different<00:02:39.150> covers<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.270> credit<00:02:40.629> of<00:02:40.750> it

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.869 

that's<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> irregular<00:02:46.160> cover<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.610> kind<00:02:46.790> of

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
that's the irregular cover to kind of

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.339 
that's the irregular cover to kind of
coincide<00:02:47.629> with<00:02:47.660> Hill<00:02:47.870> there's<00:02:48.019> something<00:02:48.200> to

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
coincide with Hill there's something to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:59.290 
coincide with Hill there's something to
fear<00:02:48.500> covers<00:02:57.129> and<00:02:58.129> this<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.610> chromium<00:02:59.060> one

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
fear covers and this is the chromium one

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.240 
fear covers and this is the chromium one
so<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.599> can<00:02:59.660> see<00:02:59.810> it's<00:02:59.930> got<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> cool<00:03:00.950> chrome
