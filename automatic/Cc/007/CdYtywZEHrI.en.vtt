 in and that is that the whole theory is 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.180

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.240
 and I have already put it on the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.770
 corner and it was the first and then I already 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.540

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.800
 women here and made with the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.750

 a lot of colored flip flops but 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.720
 really all the time they are coming 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.930
 new things in stores almost that is 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.130
 an offer permanently renewed every 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.540
 week I would say 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.570
 there are new products in the city are 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.850
 facts here are made only by craftsmen 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.130
 Colombians only or artisans employment 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.289
 Colombians we have all the manufacturing 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.349
 here in Medellin 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:40.779
 many are the parents heads of family 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.710
 or bad mothers heads of family and not 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.330
 it's only the materials or the 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.669
 bodies that brings the subject the molderÃ­a 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.559
 so that it is comfortable because 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.849
 this one shoe is very difficult to make 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:52.069
 A) Yes 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.229
 first of all be made human is very 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:57.499
 important my shoes are handmade 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:01.669
 they are not made by machines or in series 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:03.949
 neither by a chain were the first 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.990
 second the standards are fundamental or 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.240
 be a norm it has to be very good 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.550
 quality so that the shoe that perfect 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.139
 in the third foot the materials must 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.969
 be of very good quality and should be 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.219
 special as for footwear 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:20.969
 and fourth has to be something that can not 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:22.739
 buy and every time you receive the 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.999
 I have to go to pay for my club and 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:25.559
 I'm not something I can buy and that 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:27.209
 can renew and can go 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:31.079
 taking and updating that I feel 

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:32.879
 divine and what do you say sliding 

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:35.849
 they are divine and I stand on the street and 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.409
 have where to buy shoes and what 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.449
 What happens many times is that 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.369
 the people who live on the new campuses 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.679
 very expensive york happens to me a lot and when 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.239
 I open stores besides people do not enter 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:46.289
 because they want it to be expensive because the 

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:50.839
 products are very nice because there are 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:52.919
 a lot of variety but not the surprises at 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.419
 shopping center the most expensive ones 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.129
 shoes you have to approach they say when 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:59.429
 does not enter a sigh of sticks 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:01.319
 good the desalination many are the 

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:05.129
 good and so it 's a very positive impact 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:07.589
 she's such a hard-working young woman 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:09.419
 see the success that it has and that has 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.049
 achieved I think that with work with good 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.639
 view 

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:15.110
