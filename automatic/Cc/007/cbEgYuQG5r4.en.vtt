00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
out that was during a race that would be

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
out that was during a race that would be
bad<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.949> can't<00:01:05.220> throw<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.939> hard

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
bad and I can't throw this thing as hard

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
bad and I can't throw this thing as hard
as<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.299> 450<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.170> let's<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> air

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
as at 450 can so let's see how the air

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:25.859 
as at 450 can so let's see how the air
brake<00:01:08.189> does

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.850 

well<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.930> air<00:01:27.050> break<00:01:27.260> held<00:01:27.500> up<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.680> little

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
well the air break held up a little

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.350 
well the air break held up a little
better<00:01:28.010> you<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.280> see<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.700> lens<00:01:28.940> has<00:01:29.150> got

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
better you can see that the lens has got

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.270 
better you can see that the lens has got
some<00:01:29.690> scratches<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:30.650> I<00:01:30.860> mean<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.190> was

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
some scratches on it but I mean that was

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.460 
some scratches on it but I mean that was
a<00:01:31.310> direct<00:01:31.640> shot<00:01:31.970> it's<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:32.960> lot<00:01:33.140> better<00:01:33.320> shape

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
a direct shot it's in a lot better shape

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.580 
a direct shot it's in a lot better shape
than<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.490> lexan<00:01:34.970> version<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.690> I<00:01:35.900> mean<00:01:36.470> it

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
than the lexan version so I mean it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.350 
than the lexan version so I mean it
actually<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> biggest<00:01:37.460> damage<00:01:37.670> was<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.090> crack

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
actually the biggest damage was a crack

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.420 
actually the biggest damage was a crack
to<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.690> frame<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.680> kind<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.920> surprises

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
to the frame and that kind of surprises

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.010 
to the frame and that kind of surprises

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
when the lens breaks when it pops out

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.070 
when the lens breaks when it pops out
and<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.820> rock<00:01:46.970> gets<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.600> face<00:01:47.780> you

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600 
further than just throwing rocks I'm
gonna<00:02:02.420> actually<00:02:02.539> shoot<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.050> with<00:02:04.039> some<00:02:04.250> target

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
gonna actually shoot it with some target

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.389 
gonna actually shoot it with some target
load<00:02:04.789> 12-gauge<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.810> we'll<00:02:06.440> see<00:02:06.649> how<00:02:07.220> these

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
load 12-gauge so we'll see how these

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.130 
load 12-gauge so we'll see how these
things<00:02:07.610> stack<00:02:07.910> up<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.300> more<00:02:08.479> extreme<00:02:08.810> type

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
things stack up in a more extreme type

00:02:09.140 --> 00:03:05.740 
things stack up in a more extreme type
of<00:02:09.350> test

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.540 

we<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.900> see<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.920> shotgun<00:03:08.310> blast

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
we can see that the shotgun blast

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.190 
we can see that the shotgun blast
definitely<00:03:09.030> did<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.270> trick<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.900> really

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
definitely did the trick if you really

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.380 
definitely did the trick if you really
look<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> individual<00:03:11.190> dimples<00:03:11.640> not<00:03:12.180> a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
look at the individual dimples not a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000 
look at the individual dimples not a
single<00:03:12.810> one<00:03:12.960> of<00:03:13.020> these<00:03:13.170> pellets<00:03:13.560> actually

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
single one of these pellets actually

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.890 
single one of these pellets actually
pierced<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.790> saluting<00:03:15.210> light<00:03:15.330> lens<00:03:15.570> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
pierced the saluting light lens so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.470 
pierced the saluting light lens so
that's<00:03:16.380> much<00:03:16.680> much<00:03:17.220> better<00:03:17.550> than<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.090> lexan

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
that's much much better than the lexan

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.200 
that's much much better than the lexan
style<00:03:18.750> where<00:03:18.930> every<00:03:19.470> single<00:03:20.370> one<00:03:20.520> actually

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
style where every single one actually

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.640 
style where every single one actually
went<00:03:21.450> through<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.020> plastic

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
went through the plastic

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.070 
went through the plastic
so<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.550> know<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.820> thing<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.030> cracked<00:03:24.480> it's

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
so you know this thing is cracked it's

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.760 
so you know this thing is cracked it's
broken

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
broken

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.580 
broken
it's<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.700> most<00:03:26.970> certainly<00:03:27.570> destroyed<00:03:28.080> as

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
it's it is most certainly destroyed as

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.230 
it's it is most certainly destroyed as
far<00:03:28.770> as<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.950> Pluta<00:03:29.220> night<00:03:29.370> goes<00:03:29.580> if<00:03:30.000> you'll

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
far as the Pluta night goes if you'll

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.180 
far as the Pluta night goes if you'll
notice<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:31.020> thing's<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.350> lot<00:03:31.500> flatter<00:03:31.830> than

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
notice this thing's a lot flatter than

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.190 
notice this thing's a lot flatter than
it<00:03:32.280> used<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:32.550> be<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.270> know<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.870> didn't

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it used to be so you know I didn't

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.440 
it used to be so you know I didn't
really<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.620> supported<00:03:35.460> in<00:03:35.730> its<00:03:36.150> natural

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
really have it supported in its natural

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.870 
really have it supported in its natural
curvature<00:03:36.960> with<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.740> sandbag<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.550> think

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
curvature with the sandbag so I think

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.490 
curvature with the sandbag so I think
that<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.240> blast<00:03:39.540> kind<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.020> straightened<00:03:40.440> it

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
that the blast kind of straightened it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.930 
that the blast kind of straightened it
out<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.890> that's<00:03:41.220> what<00:03:41.400> created<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.880> this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
out and that's what created this this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.330 
out and that's what created this this
large<00:03:42.510> hole<00:03:42.780> here<00:03:42.990> but<00:03:43.020> as<00:03:43.590> far<00:03:43.950> as<00:03:43.980> being

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
large hole here but as far as being

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.940 
large hole here but as far as being
resistant<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.090> penetration<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.410> much<00:03:46.650> much

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
resistant to penetration it is much much

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.070 
resistant to penetration it is much much
superior<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.910> lexan<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:48.660> far<00:03:48.840> as<00:03:48.960> our

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
superior to this lexan as far as our

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.380 
superior to this lexan as far as our
experiments<00:03:49.650> dictate<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:50.370> pretty<00:03:51.180> dang

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
experiments dictate so pretty dang

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.120 
experiments dictate so pretty dang
impressive<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.990> mean<00:03:52.170> you're<00:03:52.650> not<00:03:52.770> gonna<00:03:52.950> get

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
impressive I mean you're not gonna get

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.500 
impressive I mean you're not gonna get
shot<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.580> 12<00:03:53.820> we<00:03:53.880> had<00:03:53.970> out<00:03:54.090> on<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.300> track

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
shot with the 12 we had out on the track

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.200 
shot with the 12 we had out on the track
but<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.830> goes<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.160> show<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.400> as<00:03:56.850> far

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
but this just goes to show that as far

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.820 
but this just goes to show that as far
as<00:03:57.330> being<00:03:57.420> ballistically<00:03:58.050> rated<00:03:58.530> you're

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
as being ballistically rated you're

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.990 
as being ballistically rated you're
talking<00:03:59.130> about<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.460> serious<00:03:59.910> eye

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
talking about some serious eye

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
talking about some serious eye
protection<00:04:00.360> with<00:04:00.660> this<00:04:00.810> blue<00:04:01.020> tonight<00:04:01.260> versus

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
protection with this blue tonight versus

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.890 
protection with this blue tonight versus
your<00:04:01.770> standard<00:04:02.160> lexan<00:04:02.520> lens<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:02.940> definitely<00:04:03.570> I

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
your standard lexan lens so definitely I

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.450 
your standard lexan lens so definitely I
would<00:04:04.260> rather<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.740> this<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:05.100> front<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.340> my

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
would rather have this in front of my

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.660 
would rather have this in front of my
eyes<00:04:05.640> than<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.300> old-school<00:04:06.750> style<00:04:07.170> so

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
eyes than the old-school style so

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.830 
eyes than the old-school style so
Oakley's<00:04:08.670> air<00:04:08.880> break<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.210> Mexico<00:04:09.360> go<00:04:09.720> let's

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
Oakley's air break in Mexico go let's

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.910 
Oakley's air break in Mexico go let's
check<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.200> out

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
check it out
