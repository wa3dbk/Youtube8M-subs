hi okay so today we're talking just a
little<00:00:03.149> bit<00:00:03.240> about<00:00:03.560> exercise<00:00:04.560> balls<00:00:04.890> what

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
little bit about exercise balls what

little bit about exercise balls what
isn't<00:00:05.609> exercisable<00:00:06.980> most<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.069> you've

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
isn't exercisable most of you've

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.799 
isn't exercisable most of you've
probably<00:00:08.400> seen<00:00:08.670> these<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.970> gyms<00:00:09.210> but<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.630> just

probably seen these in gyms but you just
haven't<00:00:10.110> exactly<00:00:10.349> known<00:00:10.650> how<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> use<00:00:11.099> them

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
haven't exactly known how to use them

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.530 
haven't exactly known how to use them
and<00:00:11.309> I'm<00:00:11.490> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> show<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.150> little<00:00:12.420> bit

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and I'm going to show you a little bit

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.419 
and I'm going to show you a little bit
today<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:13.080> some<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.889> advantages<00:00:14.190> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
today about some of the advantages of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
today about some of the advantages of
using<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.880> exercise<00:00:15.240> ball<00:00:15.480> or<00:00:15.750> stability<00:00:15.960> ball

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
using an exercise ball or stability ball

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.570 
using an exercise ball or stability ball
versus<00:00:17.340> using<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.730> flat<00:00:17.940> surface<00:00:20.539> for<00:00:21.539> example

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.880 

if<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:25.270> were<00:00:25.360> to<00:00:25.420> get<00:00:25.539> on<00:00:25.660> that<00:00:25.840> now<00:00:26.650> we're<00:00:26.800> going

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
if I were to get on that now we're going

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.130 
if I were to get on that now we're going
to<00:00:26.980> do<00:00:27.130> just<00:00:27.160> a<00:00:27.430> regular<00:00:27.640> crunch<00:00:28.060> I'm<00:00:28.900> most

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
to do just a regular crunch I'm most

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.339 
to do just a regular crunch I'm most
people<00:00:29.380> use<00:00:29.560> stability<00:00:30.040> balls<00:00:30.250> for<00:00:31.349> abdominal

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
people use stability balls for abdominal

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.170 
people use stability balls for abdominal
exercises<00:00:32.980> so<00:00:33.280> that's<00:00:33.460> why<00:00:33.610> this<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:33.910> great

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
exercises so that's why this is a great

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.000 
exercises so that's why this is a great
example<00:00:34.300> for<00:00:34.630> you<00:00:34.930> if<00:00:35.140> you're<00:00:35.680> going<00:00:35.830> to<00:00:35.890> do<00:00:35.980> a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
example for you if you're going to do a

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.440 
example for you if you're going to do a
regular<00:00:36.190> crunchy<00:00:36.670> probably<00:00:37.090> on<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.210> flat

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
regular crunchy probably on a flat

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.650 
regular crunchy probably on a flat
surface<00:00:37.480> like<00:00:38.020> this<00:00:38.410> yoga<00:00:38.890> mat

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
surface like this yoga mat

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.630 
surface like this yoga mat
and<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:41.170> would<00:00:41.290> get<00:00:41.380> the<00:00:41.500> position<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:42.520> you

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
and you would get the position and you

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.130 
and you would get the position and you
put<00:00:42.820> your<00:00:42.970> hands<00:00:43.090> behind<00:00:43.239> your<00:00:43.510> head

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
put your hands behind your head

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.260 
put your hands behind your head
you<00:00:45.230> crunch<00:00:45.530> up<00:00:45.710> like<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:46.130> and<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:47.090> roll

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
you crunch up like that and you roll

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.819 
you crunch up like that and you roll
your<00:00:47.300> spine<00:00:47.540> back<00:00:47.840> down<00:00:48.050> on<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.200> floor<00:00:48.470> okay

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
your spine back down on the floor okay

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.160 
your spine back down on the floor okay
now<00:00:48.980> what<00:00:49.160> you<00:00:49.280> see<00:00:49.520> here<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:50.000> good<00:00:50.899> crunch

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
now what you see here is a good crunch

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.990 
now what you see here is a good crunch
which<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.040> is<00:00:52.220> called<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.550> Flex<00:00:52.820> position

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
which this is called the Flex position

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.900 
which this is called the Flex position
for<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.480> abdominals<00:00:54.489> when<00:00:55.489> you<00:00:55.579> come<00:00:55.760> back

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
for the abdominals when you come back

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.410 
for the abdominals when you come back
down<00:00:56.290> you're<00:00:57.290> in<00:00:57.440> extension<00:00:57.980> however<00:00:58.420> your

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
down you're in extension however your

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.730 
down you're in extension however your
extension<00:00:59.989> motion

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
extension motion

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.340 
extension motion
is<00:01:01.800> its<00:01:02.790> kind<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> deterred<00:01:03.540> by<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> floor<00:01:04.170> by

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is its kind of deterred by the floor by

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
is its kind of deterred by the floor by
the<00:01:04.380> flat<00:01:04.680> surface<00:01:05.420> what<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> stability<00:01:06.750> ball

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the flat surface what a stability ball

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.270 
the flat surface what a stability ball
does<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:08.120> it<00:01:09.120> sort<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.530> circular<00:01:10.800> motion

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
does is it sort of the circular motion

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.040 
does is it sort of the circular motion
curves<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.940> spine<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> allows<00:01:13.020> for

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
curves to your spine so it allows for

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.070 
curves to your spine so it allows for
flexion<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.070> further<00:01:14.490> extension<00:01:15.150> which<00:01:15.840> kind

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
flexion and further extension which kind

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.680 
flexion and further extension which kind
of<00:01:16.110> gives<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.440> more<00:01:16.920> comprehensive

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
of gives you a more comprehensive

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.670 
of gives you a more comprehensive
abdominal<00:01:18.690> workout<00:01:19.020> let<00:01:19.230> me<00:01:19.290> show<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
abdominal workout let me show you what I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.110 
abdominal workout let me show you what I
mean
