be at Chicago soldier field I know that
every<00:00:24.769> coach<00:00:25.009> coach<00:00:25.640> has<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:25.910> certain<00:00:26.240> level<00:00:26.570> of

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
every coach coach has a certain level of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.140 
every coach coach has a certain level of
anxiety<00:00:27.130> when<00:00:28.130> he<00:00:28.249> leaves<00:00:28.519> home<00:00:28.820> for<00:00:29.089> the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
anxiety when he leaves home for the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.579 
anxiety when he leaves home for the
first<00:00:29.300> time<00:00:29.480> would<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:29.869> not<00:00:30.019> agree<00:00:30.050> yeah<00:00:30.499> the

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
first time would you not agree yeah the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.710 
first time would you not agree yeah the
routine<00:00:30.919> changes<00:00:31.159> I<00:00:31.489> think<00:00:31.909> most<00:00:32.090> coaches<00:00:32.480> and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
routine changes I think most coaches and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.210 
routine changes I think most coaches and
Brett<00:00:32.989> would<00:00:33.140> be<00:00:33.260> among<00:00:33.560> them<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.980> try<00:00:34.160> to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
Brett would be among them you try to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.040

another<00:00:47.270> stadium<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.810> think<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.260> lure<00:00:48.590> of<00:00:48.680> an

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
another stadium I think the lure of an

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.950 
another stadium I think the lure of an
NFL<00:00:49.190> stadium<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:50.030> exciting<00:00:50.570> for<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.780> lot<00:00:50.930> of

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
NFL stadium is exciting for a lot of

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.020 
NFL stadium is exciting for a lot of
these<00:00:51.110> guys<00:00:51.320> but<00:00:51.860> you're<00:00:52.010> right<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.220> routine

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
these guys but you're right the routine

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.330 
these guys but you're right the routine
changes<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.570> little<00:00:53.750> bit<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.680> first<00:00:55.070> time

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
changes a little bit and that first time

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.910 
changes a little bit and that first time
I<00:00:55.640> think<00:00:55.880> coaches<00:00:56.510> are<00:00:56.720> they<00:00:56.900> might<00:00:57.260> might<00:00:57.770> be

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
I think coaches are they might might be

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.790 
I think coaches are they might might be
a<00:00:57.950> little<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.460> little<00:00:58.940> bit<00:00:59.090> more<00:00:59.360> concern<00:00:59.900> just

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
a little a little bit more concern just

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.870 
a little a little bit more concern just
because<00:01:01.070> everything's<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.580> little<00:01:01.670> bit

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
because everything's a little bit

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.340 
because everything's a little bit
different<00:01:02.270> it's<00:01:02.690> pretty<00:01:02.870> rare<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.140> have<00:01:03.290> a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.189 
computer but I think there will be
enough<00:05:06.740> media<00:05:07.250> there<00:05:07.819> that<00:05:08.389> if<00:05:08.539> he<00:05:08.659> continues

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
enough media there that if he continues

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.950 
enough media there that if he continues
to<00:05:09.229> play<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.740> way<00:05:09.860> he<00:05:09.889> has<00:05:10.419> his<00:05:11.419> name<00:05:11.779> is

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
to play the way he has his name is

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.420 
to play the way he has his name is
probably<00:05:12.439> going<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.710> start<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.069> get<00:05:13.189> mentioned

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
probably going to start to get mentioned

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.670 
probably going to start to get mentioned
a<00:05:13.610> little<00:05:13.729> more<00:05:14.000> you're<00:05:14.210> seeing<00:05:14.479> it<00:05:14.750> some<00:05:15.139> but

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
a little more you're seeing it some but

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.800 
a little more you're seeing it some but
on<00:05:15.800> some<00:05:16.069> of<00:05:16.159> these<00:05:16.250> lists<00:05:16.610> he<00:05:17.029> hasn't<00:05:17.479> made<00:05:17.629> it

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
on some of these lists he hasn't made it

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.879 
on some of these lists he hasn't made it
yet<00:05:17.840> but<00:05:18.080> if<00:05:18.169> he<00:05:18.259> can<00:05:18.409> put<00:05:18.590> up<00:05:18.680> big<00:05:18.860> numbers

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
yet but if he can put up big numbers

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.550 
yet but if he can put up big numbers
again<00:05:19.520> then<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.479> think<00:05:20.750> that<00:05:20.930> name<00:05:21.110> starts<00:05:21.469> to

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
again then I think that name starts to

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.140 
again then I think that name starts to
pop<00:05:21.710> off<00:05:21.949> me<00:05:22.129> what<00:05:22.550> are<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.729> odds<00:05:22.819> a<00:05:23.000> few

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
pop off me what are the odds a few

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.579 
pop off me what are the odds a few
