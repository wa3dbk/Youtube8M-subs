00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.800
 hello youtube friends talk to you 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.349
 mystery 360 today I will teach you how to 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.279
 put videos to nintendo 3ds the links 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.279
 I leave you in the description 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.910
 since we have everything ready to start 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.280
 we go to our folder when downloading 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.230
 there will only be four files but after 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.750
 a file of the first use will be added 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.790
 configuration we have the executable that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.800
 It is the only one that we will occupy the fonpet 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.600
 necessary for the operation of the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.320
 program and two more files that do not 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.320
 they should erase 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.390
 we started the 3 of that video, we have to 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.690
 give us a minute to see all your 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.690
 content 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.430
 very good now let's find our 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.560
 video we click on the first button of 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.110
 bruce and we explored our hard drive in 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.820
 look for him when they have it open 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.830
 and the address will be added in the first 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.720
 box as well as the name and others 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.450
 information in other parts of the program 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.430
 the next will be to click on the other 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 Braus button to choose the folder 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.210
 where will end our video said 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.210
 folder must not contain spaces 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.680
 it's time to fix the options what 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 first it will be to specify what is the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.540
 format of your video if of baix and of a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.180
 3d video with the effect side by side 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.180
 the most common will almost always have to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.489
 use this top button a 3d video whose 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 effect is created with two images but to 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.410
 Unlike the previous one, these are 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.950
 one on top of the other 3ds a video 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.950
 captured in 3ds 2 of a video in 2d 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.040
 extra options here we have four 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.650
 options from which to choose 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.620
 mirror input video reflects the video 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.290
 selected is to say what flips that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.420
 aspec radio I recommend enabling this 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.299
 option prevents the video from becoming deformed and 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.940
 that maintains its original aspect create you 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.970
 style of x seconds I do not know what it's for 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.159
 but better not move it sudo a pc windows 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.610
 turn off the pc when the 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.610
 conversion 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.650
 we only adjust the quality bar 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.349
 one being the highest and 31 the lowest 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.680
 while lower quality less weight in the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.680
 archive 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.270
 we edit some audio options with 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.770
 I'm not going to go deep 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.770
 with those that are by default 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.599
 after all the above just missing 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 give it to see the green bar we 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.489
 will inform the progress and in the end it will leave 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.780
 something like that and we can appreciate the folder 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.780
 with the converted videos 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.140
 1 I can not find the video is an error 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.240
 quite common I recommend creating a 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.950
 folder on the local disk like I did 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.320
 in the tutorial to keep track of 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.330
 the videos if it still does not appear 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.700
 then run the program as 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.740
 administrator and try again click 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.260
 right execute as administrator 2 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.740
 very well I already have the video where 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.170
 I put target s of 100 min 0 3 this 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.600
 name varies just put it in the first 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.810
 photo folder 3 I do not understand your 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.000
 tutorial what part do not you understand write 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.660
 a good question and I will try to help you 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.940
 4 I do not understand your answer, ask another 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.690
 maybe one of the two parties is not 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.610
 explained well 5 I do not understand anything then 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.640
 do not play with the program and finish 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.220
 doing something that you should not 6 do not 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.730

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.200
