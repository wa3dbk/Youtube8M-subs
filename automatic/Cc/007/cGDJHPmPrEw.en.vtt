00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
entire show reason being it was the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.360 
entire show reason being it was the
second<00:05:27.900> taping<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:28.500> these<00:05:28.800> crowds<00:05:29.100> are

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
second taping and these crowds are

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.430 
second taping and these crowds are
notoriously<00:05:29.970> dead<00:05:30.690> for<00:05:30.960> these<00:05:31.080> second

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
notoriously dead for these second

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.110 
notoriously dead for these second
tapings<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:31.920> I<00:05:31.950> felt<00:05:32.430> kind<00:05:32.610> of<00:05:32.670> bad<00:05:32.820> for<00:05:32.850> these

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
tapings so I felt kind of bad for these

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.600 
tapings so I felt kind of bad for these
guys<00:05:33.290> Mike<00:05:34.290> today<00:05:34.500> made<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:34.920> clear<00:05:35.100> very<00:05:35.340> early

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
guys Mike today made it clear very early

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.860 
guys Mike today made it clear very early
in<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.790> bout<00:05:35.970> that<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> winner<00:05:36.480> had<00:05:36.690> to

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
in the bout that the winner had to

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.750 
in the bout that the winner had to
maintain<00:05:37.080> possession<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.310> briefcase

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
maintain possession of the briefcase

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.880 
maintain possession of the briefcase
after<00:05:39.180> retrieving<00:05:39.600> it<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:39.930> they<00:05:40.530> pretty<00:05:40.740> much

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
after retrieving it so they pretty much

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.760 
after retrieving it so they pretty much
telegraphed<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.550> finish<00:05:41.910> right<00:05:42.090> there

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
telegraphed the finish right there

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.050

apparently<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.340> briefcase<00:05:44.730> is<00:05:44.910> now<00:05:45.030> a

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
apparently the the briefcase is now a

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.110 
apparently the the briefcase is now a
football<00:05:45.800> which<00:05:46.800> makes<00:05:47.010> sense<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.490> guess<00:05:47.520> given

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
football which makes sense I guess given

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.330 
football which makes sense I guess given
that<00:05:48.270> NFL<00:05:49.050> referees<00:05:49.620> have<00:05:49.830> been<00:05:49.980> about<00:05:50.160> as

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
that NFL referees have been about as

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.250 
that NFL referees have been about as
reliable<00:05:50.670> with<00:05:51.180> their<00:05:51.330> calls<00:05:51.570> lately<00:05:51.840> as<00:05:52.050> pro

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260
