 orphan 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.950
 therefore there must be no idea 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.900
 on the pictures 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 and quickly it limits so that I help 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.560
 because say scp finds headline 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.110

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 it cost 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.249
 the saleswoman 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.249
 what a bunch of lazy chairs fall 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.549
 that is ten years ago 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.379
 both 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.549
 once the day 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.549
 for a good ten days 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.299
 the couple already have a bit about the away match twice a week 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 at the shortest end 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.859
 pauwr the case is coming 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.839
 the leader would not do that 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.679
 but correct 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.679
 matches 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.539
 the man rode with these gentlemen 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.079
 would become Dutch

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.889
 the museum 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.889
 so it must be clear 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.180
 experts and 16 years 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.249
 now I am scared

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.009
 a shame 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.400
 media etc. 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 why being interrogated can be the right one 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 among the young 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.389
 you will get where possible 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.339
 it will be a while 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.119
 the following year 

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:16.080
 it is therefore insured

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.300
 there are many injured 

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:51.089

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:52.809
 it's all at the eo 

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:55.460
