 in the heat of the last days nothing better 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.189
 what an ice cream to refresh but you 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.059
 already stopped to think how this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.880
 delicious 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.299
 well, our team went to visit 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.190
 gedeon ice cream factory in japan you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 will keep mouth watering 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.160
 for 17 years a gb or works in the production 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.830
 of high-quality ice creams which are 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.590
 found in more than 4 thousand points of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 sales with equipment equipped with high 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 technology the company produces on average 20 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 products 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.719
 innovating with machines and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 state-of-the- art equipment for 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.719
 to take better care of our 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 consumer 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.070
 the line the big line that the consumer 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.460
 throughout our region without 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 we are practically there now 220 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.489
 municipalities now serving directly from 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.700
 ours in 12 very large mix tael 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.049
 no products and now for this year 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.450
 several new releases 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.390
 the factory of good ge has more than 8 thousand 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.689
 square meters and we all know 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 the production sectors to accompany 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.280
 all processes of the manufacture of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.990
 properly sized personal ice cream 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.150
 we are here now to know 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 step by step the manufacture of ice cream to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.009
 Geron the gesture here from my personal side 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
 that will enter here in this first sector 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 here it all starts, that's the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.659
 stop plate starts all the way 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.060
 first stage of manufacturing that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.640
 process the ice cream tail there yes 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 starts with this is the cover of g 4 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 liters per hour four thousand liters per 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100
 hour 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 the machinery is very big here 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.220
 to support this demand that is quite 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.360
 simple and very well very well now 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.119
 bruno is going to show us to have a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 machinery is going to enter the process 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.909
 manufacture of ice creams 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.180
 this is the machine that makes pasteurization 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.610
 ice cream that the preparation of gravy that 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 will generate all the ice cream produced here 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.880
 by good gb with this sector is a sector 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.010
 little frosty, right? 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.230
 already'm up here already cold there is only 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.220
 any sector here is the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.620
 maturation 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.010
 after the stoppage in the second stage 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.680
 maturation and the house is in 2 24 hours 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.380
 which is the rest of the tail and so 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.440
 intense in calm calm this temperature 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.830
 It's cold in here, yes, it's 3 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.900
 degree and 34 grams from here 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.860
 tail for the entire production line 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.920
 calm 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.260
 the maturation update now does not 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.810
 know the good production and here is the line 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.560
 production process where all these syrup 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.870
 form 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.060
 we are on the side here is the machine 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 to make jervis saucers a machine 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.220
 italian extruder civil capacity 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.850
 full wireless popsicles worse would be 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.310
 problem 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.280
 this peak can not work anymore 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.670
 problem this but it's good, let's go like this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.040
 he is more prepared more when he has a 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.709
 another machine here that makes popsicle 5 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.770
 so the brand with attention recently is 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.290
 the Italian also 10,000 with leoni 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.260
 detail here employees do not have 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.300
 contact with a product is only at the end 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.980
 to be able to pack years will pack 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.440
 I already passed here is almost everything 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 ready exactly who the professional is 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.310
 the packaging and then the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.400
 storage paralysis 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.980
 the d'ale comes here here the cold room 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.450
 nor where the temperature is lower here 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.360
 formerly where the stoppage is made 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.650
 and here, therefore, to all the ice cream that is 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.069
 manufactured 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 there the industry it comes where it is 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.370
 prepared to reach out to the friars 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.739
 supermarkets but the show nets as 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.269
 grocery stores that see the products 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.170
 I found everything good at a temperature of minus 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.480
 28 degrees 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.030
 good people, this is the factory of 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.780
 jepom we are not out of the line of 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.090
 production 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.500
 I can take my toque off we go 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.319
 now for the most interesting part 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.959
 more important is to taste a 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.310
 Ice cream that's delicious, excuse me. 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.910
 I'll taste it because I 'm the son of 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.910
 God, too
