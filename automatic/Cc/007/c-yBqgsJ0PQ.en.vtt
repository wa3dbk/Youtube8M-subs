00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.380
 but this time I have received a box 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.200
 by computer and a keyboard and a man 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.180
 again I'm going to do the unboxing of 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.010
 keyboard and the mousepad because to the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.160
 box is too big to do it 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.160
 here 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.509
 from components 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.509
 let's open it 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.390
 I'm going to make a cut when they're out there 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.390
 do not 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.260
 all right 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.619
 of all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.240
 here comes the weakness of the lips 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 here 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.100
 the mind of god 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.920
 well I do not know what things 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 from today 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.649
 yes 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.500
 and let's see 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.210
 here it is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:03.190
 It has three different colors and the 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.800
 colors are two blue red and blue red 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.710
 and off they have all these buttons 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.710
 extras from above mechanic of the whole 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.750
 some statements also come 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.550
 so that 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.489
 to see the keyboard 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.910
 installation or hanging disk 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.180
 thinkers and here the extra keys that 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.180
 they come 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.920
 I think that for this up here is 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.710
 round one there is one 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.670
 then they have 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.650
 there is more 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.780
 ws of I suppose yes 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.690
 the indicated people states thoughts 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.610
 what is this 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.610
 after mouse pad 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.770
 that also has a sensitivity not 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.890
 be well it 's good to have high 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.890
 sensitivities 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.939
 I'm going to remove this from here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.319
 and I am here 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.510
 let's open 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.330
 As you can see, the box is also pretty 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.590
 same as the other 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.590
 here comes rolled 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.970
 and going up 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.970
 all this carpet 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.890
 of large 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.530
 or is going very well to pass the time 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:03.110
 Also, as you can see, I have it to match 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:05.390
 all and well this has been the whole box 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.090
 I'll leave you an image but it was 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.970
 too big to 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.870
 the cute color unboxing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.850
 this is the final result of boxing on 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.490
 keyboard here 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.370
 a good mouse that you can see is the 

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:24.770
 game that we call the unboxing 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.770
 with the good umbrella 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.810
 the keyboard that can be changed to 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.790
 colors you want with this key to 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.190
 none to red where on the screen and 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.800
 here you can adjust the brightness that 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.930
 you want here it looks better 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.249
 and the house that told you then from state 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.889
 phantom 410 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:53.209
 as you see blue milk has three 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.209
 fans like this 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.840
 if you see a lot and here you see the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.840
 pp components 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.920

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.200
