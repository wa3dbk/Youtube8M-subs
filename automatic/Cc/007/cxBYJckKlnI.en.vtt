00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.310 

I<00:00:11.059> decided<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.270> do<00:00:12.450> postgraduate<00:00:12.930> study

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
I decided to do postgraduate study

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.900 
I decided to do postgraduate study
because<00:00:13.740> I'd<00:00:13.830> already<00:00:13.980> done<00:00:14.400> an

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
because I'd already done an

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.070 
because I'd already done an
undergraduate<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.570> mechanical<00:00:15.930> engineering

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
undergraduate in mechanical engineering

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.019 
undergraduate in mechanical engineering
and<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.010> wanted<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> further<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and I wanted to further that and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.790 
and I wanted to further that and
specialize<00:00:18.450> just<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.840> materials<00:00:19.290> engineering

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
specialize just in materials engineering

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560 
specialize just in materials engineering
another<00:00:20.610> reason<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:20.970> doing<00:00:21.180> postgraduate

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
another reason for doing postgraduate

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
another reason for doing postgraduate
study<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.710> enable<00:00:23.220> me<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.520> become<00:00:23.849> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
study was to enable me to become a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.880 
study was to enable me to become a
chartered<00:00:24.630> engineer

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.130 

I<00:00:27.949> actually<00:00:28.820> heard<00:00:29.150> about<00:00:29.210> crumpled<00:00:29.720> universe

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
I actually heard about crumpled universe

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.599 
I actually heard about crumpled universe
because<00:00:30.349> I'm<00:00:30.439> quite<00:00:30.619> local<00:00:31.039> because<00:00:31.279> I'm<00:00:31.400> just

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
because I'm quite local because I'm just

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.430 
because I'm quite local because I'm just
from<00:00:31.730> Milton<00:00:32.000> Keynes<00:00:32.210> but<00:00:32.930> I've<00:00:32.989> also<00:00:33.170> heard

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
from Milton Keynes but I've also heard

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.510 
from Milton Keynes but I've also heard
because<00:00:33.710> it's<00:00:33.950> got<00:00:34.070> a<00:00:34.100> really<00:00:34.340> good

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
because it's got a really good

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.310 
because it's got a really good
reputation<00:00:34.820> especially<00:00:35.720> for<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.930> subjects

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
reputation especially for the subjects

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.389 
reputation especially for the subjects
that<00:00:36.350> I'm<00:00:36.500> interested<00:00:36.980> in<00:00:37.010> such<00:00:37.250> as

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
that I'm interested in such as

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.050 
that I'm interested in such as
engineering<00:00:37.850> or<00:00:38.030> materials

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.410 

I<00:00:41.650> chose<00:00:42.650> MIT<00:00:42.860> Advanced<00:00:43.400> Materials<00:00:43.580> because<00:00:44.300> I

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
I chose MIT Advanced Materials because I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.600 
I chose MIT Advanced Materials because I
really<00:00:44.810> wanted<00:00:45.080> to<00:00:45.200> do<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.620> master's<00:00:46.580> in

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
really wanted to do a master's in

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.090 
really wanted to do a master's in
materials<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.870> particular<00:00:48.110> courses

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
materials and the particular courses

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.010 
materials and the particular courses
that<00:00:49.370> were<00:00:49.490> in<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.540> degree<00:00:50.840> really

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
that were in the in the degree really

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.420 
that were in the in the degree really
interested<00:00:51.650> me<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:51.950> thought<00:00:52.070> that's<00:00:52.250> what

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
interested me and I thought that's what

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.590 
interested me and I thought that's what
was<00:00:52.580> going<00:00:52.700> to<00:00:52.760> be<00:00:52.880> useful<00:00:53.090> for<00:00:53.300> my<00:00:53.420> career

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.750 

so<00:00:57.410> my<00:00:57.590> time<00:00:57.770> at<00:00:57.920> Cranford<00:00:58.310> I've<00:00:58.400> really

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
so my time at Cranford I've really

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.870 
so my time at Cranford I've really
enjoyed<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.570> actual<00:00:59.960> lectures<00:01:00.380> at<00:01:00.560> Cranfield

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
enjoyed the actual lectures at Cranfield

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.770 
enjoyed the actual lectures at Cranfield
well<00:01:01.880> there<00:01:02.030> was<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.210> mixture<00:01:02.480> of<00:01:02.660> both

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
well there was a mixture of both

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.140 
well there was a mixture of both
practical<00:01:03.500> activities<00:01:04.159> in<00:01:04.370> my<00:01:04.460> group<00:01:04.670> group

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
practical activities in my group group

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.790 
practical activities in my group group
projects<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.690> my<00:01:05.810> individual<00:01:06.229> project<00:01:06.590> and

I<00:01:14.390> really<00:01:14.690> enjoyed<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.050> part<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.740> it

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
I really enjoyed that part of it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.710 
I really enjoyed that part of it
probably<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.640> highlight<00:01:16.820> for<00:01:17.180> me<00:01:17.300> was<00:01:17.330> was

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
probably the highlight for me was was

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.050 
probably the highlight for me was was

so<00:01:40.910> my<00:01:41.030> individual<00:01:41.480> project<00:01:41.810> was<00:01:41.960> sponsored

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
so my individual project was sponsored

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.500 
so my individual project was sponsored
by<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.740> local<00:01:42.860> company<00:01:43.430> called<00:01:43.880> Scott<00:01:44.120> Barda

by a local company called Scott Barda

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.690 
by a local company called Scott Barda
and<00:01:44.630> they<00:01:45.050> specialize<00:01:45.890> in<00:01:45.920> resin

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
and they specialize in resin

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.390 
and they specialize in resin
manufacturer<00:01:47.360> primarily<00:01:47.930> my<00:01:48.590> actual<00:01:49.070> project

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
manufacturer primarily my actual project

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.100 
manufacturer primarily my actual project
was<00:01:49.640> looking<00:01:50.060> at<00:01:50.270> different<00:01:50.450> resin<00:01:50.930> types

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
was looking at different resin types

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.230 
was looking at different resin types
with<00:01:51.290> carbon<00:01:51.650> fiber<00:01:51.920> normally<00:01:52.850> you'd<00:01:52.970> use<00:01:53.000> an

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
with carbon fiber normally you'd use an

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.390 
with carbon fiber normally you'd use an
epoxy<00:01:53.479> resin<00:01:53.660> when<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.229> make<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.830> carbon<00:01:55.220> fiber

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
epoxy resin when you make a carbon fiber

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.160 
epoxy resin when you make a carbon fiber
composite<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.300> project<00:01:56.630> was<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.840> look

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
composite and this project was to look

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.050 
composite and this project was to look
at<00:01:57.380> vinyl<00:01:57.590> esters<00:01:58.040> urethane<00:01:58.430> acrylics<00:01:58.910> and

Bader<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:04.280> then<00:02:04.850> maybe<00:02:05.180> once<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.600> week<00:02:05.630> I'd

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
Bader with then maybe once a week I'd

graduate<00:02:13.560> course<00:02:13.850> probably<00:02:14.850> don't<00:02:15.060> differ

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
graduate course probably don't differ

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.790 
graduate course probably don't differ
too<00:02:15.480> much<00:02:15.690> my<00:02:15.900> undergraduate<00:02:16.320> course

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
too much my undergraduate course

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.470 
too much my undergraduate course
obviously<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> technical<00:02:18.030> skills

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
obviously there was the technical skills

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600 
obviously there was the technical skills
that<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.690> learned<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.500> then<00:02:19.620> i<00:02:19.650> built<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
that I learned but then i built on the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.640 
that I learned but then i built on the
the<00:02:21.090> softer<00:02:21.480> skill<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> team<00:02:22.230> building

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the softer skill so the team building

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.410 
the softer skill so the team building
presentation<00:02:23.340> skills<00:02:23.670> things<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.210> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.589 

I'd<00:02:28.200> say<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> main<00:02:28.620> difference<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
I'd say the main difference the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.430 
I'd say the main difference the
postgraduate<00:02:30.599> study<00:02:30.990> differs<00:02:31.380> from

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
postgraduate study differs from

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.530 
postgraduate study differs from
undergraduate<00:02:32.069> study<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.459> you're<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:33.180> lot

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
undergraduate study is that you're a lot

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
undergraduate study is that you're a lot
more<00:02:33.599> specialized<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> subject<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.099> you

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
more specialized in the subject that you

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.050 
more specialized in the subject that you
want<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.610> go<00:02:36.030> into<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:37.099> also<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.640> students

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
want to go into and also the students

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.400 
want to go into and also the students
that<00:02:39.150> are<00:02:39.209> there<00:02:39.300> really<00:02:39.660> want<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.200> there

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that are there really want to be there

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.979 
that are there really want to be there
so<00:02:40.500> everyone<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.130> quite<00:02:41.970> keen<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.720> and

so everyone is quite keen to get on and

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.870 
so everyone is quite keen to get on and
study<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> group<00:02:43.890> group<00:02:44.400> projects<00:02:44.790> for

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
study so the group group projects for

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.309 
study so the group group projects for
example<00:02:44.910> everyone<00:02:45.450> wants<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> work<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
example everyone wants to work in it you

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.570 
example everyone wants to work in it you
don't<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> couple<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> group<00:02:47.550> that

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
don't have the couple in the group that

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.280 
don't have the couple in the group that
are<00:02:47.940> only<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:48.720> there<00:02:48.930> because<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.140> want

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
are only really there because they want

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.840 
are only really there because they want
to<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.470> at<00:02:49.560> university<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.430> study<00:02:50.670> so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
to be at university not to study so

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.910 
to be at university not to study so
everyone's<00:02:51.150> got<00:02:51.600> got<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.319> same<00:02:52.470> feelings

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
everyone's got got the same feelings

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.530 
everyone's got got the same feelings
about<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:53.489> studies<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.060> really

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
about about studies that I really

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.150 
about about studies that I really
enjoyed<00:02:54.750> that

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.190 

think<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.210> most<00:02:59.600> about<00:02:59.690> Cranfield

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
think I like most about Cranfield

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.290 
think I like most about Cranfield
University<00:03:00.260> he<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.220> probably<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.850> quality<00:03:02.210> of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
University he is probably the quality of

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.630 
University he is probably the quality of
the<00:03:02.420> teaching<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:03.170> also<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:04.130> high<00:03:04.280> numbers

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
the teaching and also the high numbers

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.250 
the teaching and also the high numbers
of<00:03:04.670> international<00:03:05.420> students<00:03:05.930> I've<00:03:06.050> really

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
of international students I've really

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.100 
of international students I've really
enjoyed<00:03:06.350> speaking<00:03:07.040> with<00:03:07.310> all<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.700> them<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.930> I

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
enjoyed speaking with all of them and I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.900 
enjoyed speaking with all of them and I
also<00:03:09.260> like<00:03:09.470> all<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.370> high<00:03:10.490> quality<00:03:10.880> of

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
also like all the the high quality of

also like all the the high quality of
the<00:03:11.030> facilities<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.570> we<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:11.900> access<00:03:12.410> to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.480 

probably<00:03:16.820> my<00:03:16.910> strongest<00:03:17.390> memories<00:03:17.510> are

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
probably my strongest memories are

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.860 
probably my strongest memories are
working<00:03:19.490> an<00:03:19.580> awful<00:03:19.880> lot<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.240> spent<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.720> lot<00:03:20.810> of

that I've made throughout the course of
my<00:03:25.460> group<00:03:25.670> projects

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.899 

the<00:03:29.510> course<00:03:29.719> more<00:03:30.140> than<00:03:30.349> met<00:03:30.530> my<00:03:30.769> expectations

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
the course more than met my expectations

I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and I
learned<00:03:35.329> as<00:03:36.109> opposed<00:03:36.469> to<00:03:36.560> my<00:03:36.680> undergraduate

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
learned as opposed to my undergraduate

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.979 
learned as opposed to my undergraduate
degree<00:03:37.489> comparing<00:03:38.000> with<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.510> felt<00:03:38.900> I

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
degree comparing with that I felt I

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.160 
degree comparing with that I felt I
actually<00:03:39.140> learnt<00:03:39.939> about<00:03:40.939> about<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.750> topics<00:03:42.109> I

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170

was<00:03:42.260> being<00:03:42.409> taught<00:03:42.530> rather<00:03:42.739> than<00:03:42.950> just<00:03:43.099> being

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
was being taught rather than just being

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.130 
was being taught rather than just being
kind<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.549> taught<00:03:43.730> them<00:03:43.909> to<00:03:43.939> pass<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.689> exam<00:03:44.989> I

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
kind of taught them to pass the exam I

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.869 
kind of taught them to pass the exam I
actually<00:03:45.290> felt<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.829> came<00:03:46.040> away<00:03:46.189> the<00:03:46.430> really

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
actually felt I came away the really

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.140 
actually felt I came away the really
good<00:03:47.000> understanding<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.750> all<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.989> modules

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.119 

I'd<00:03:51.840> highly<00:03:52.319> recommend<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.799> course<00:03:52.920> at

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
white materials engineer at Jaguar Land

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.990 
white materials engineer at Jaguar Land
Rover<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.740> that's<00:04:08.130> concerned<00:04:08.550> with<00:04:08.730> looking

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
Rover and that's concerned with looking

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000 
Rover and that's concerned with looking
at<00:04:09.150> all<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.540> sheet<00:04:09.750> metal<00:04:09.960> on<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.770> vehicle

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
at all of the sheet metal on a vehicle

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.650 
at all of the sheet metal on a vehicle
before<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.580> painted<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.240> I<00:04:12.270> look<00:04:12.480> after

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
before it's painted so I look after

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.810 
before it's painted so I look after
items<00:04:13.140> such<00:04:13.290> as<00:04:13.320> corrosion<00:04:13.800> making<00:04:14.460> sure<00:04:14.700> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
items such as corrosion making sure the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
right grades chosen for a car and then I

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.070 
right grades chosen for a car and then I
also<00:04:17.550> look<00:04:17.820> at<00:04:17.970> problems<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:18.840> you've<00:04:18.959> got

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
also look at problems so if you've got

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.180 
also look at problems so if you've got
any<00:04:19.520> fatigue<00:04:20.520> issues<00:04:21.470> any<00:04:22.470> corrosion

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
any fatigue issues any corrosion

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.890 
any fatigue issues any corrosion
problems<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.090> field<00:04:24.240> things<00:04:24.570> like<00:04:24.720> that

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
problems in the field things like that

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.879 
problems in the field things like that
so<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.200> up<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.440> whole<00:04:25.590> body<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.070> white

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889
