00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.540
 As usual, I arrived first. 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.450
 As soon as I got a seat, I saw an enemy. 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.820
 You tried to handle me. 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.570
 My tram and I were faster. 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 Soon the friend arrived and now we have to move again. 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.120
 The enemy may have been waiting for it. 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.960
 AMX 50 B is in danger 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 I sold my eyes for a while. 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.930
 I will not tolerate any mistakes 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440
 The body is very big and easy to hit. 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.600
 It is also an easy prey of self-propelled 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.960
 It's hard to find cover. 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 Body size alone is not a problem. 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.060
 The gloves are very thin and easily penetrated. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.340
 When the glove penetrates, many parts are destroyed. 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.900
 The red warning light shining from one corner of the screen may hurt your eyes. 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.370
 Clip-type guns contain four shells. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.290
 The average attack per clip is only 1,600 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.410
 It's not enough to defeat the enemy tank with a single clip. 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.850
 1: 1 game should be avoided 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.560
 It was a terrible battle, but it survived. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.900
 A strong enemy tank is hiding somewhere. 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.820
 I can regret it, 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.160
 Now we have to rush forward and surprise. 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.000
 Oh! I was waiting. 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.910
 It's over now. 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.480
 It can happen to anyone. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.860
 Remember that the AMX 50 B can move anywhere on the battlefield 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.540
 It is a tram that has the spirit of a true warrior. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.250
 Warriors do not think of pain 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.790
 The warrior knows his powers and knows how to win. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080
 There are many ways to win 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.530
 The AMX 50 B is a good way to find out. 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.450
 For example, you can choose the direction of movement at the start of a battle 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.480
 You can enter the city by following a heavy tank unit. 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.810
 We can move with a medium tank unit. 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 Provide remote fire support near the base 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.840
 You can watch the battle progress. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.700
 The AMX 50 B boasts exceptional maneuverability that allows for a variety of tactics 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.480
 It's the fastest of the midranks. 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.090
 The speed and maneuverability are second to none in the mid-sized tank 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.180
 It is even faster than some mid-sized trams. 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.470
 Maneuverability is a great advantage and it's also why we have weak gloves. 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.850
 But glove count is not everything. 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.340
 The front gloves are very thick and sloping. 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.460
 The front gloves are 230mm thick in some parts 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.160
 Until you fire 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.850
 I think we can hide the turret and expose only the front body gloves. 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.530
 It's not always possible. 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.400
 Warriors have hidden skills. The AMX 50 B is one of the best trams in the crash 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.770
 When you turn an alley in a city area 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.530
 I do not know, like the AMX 13 90 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.000
 May shatter the light car. 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.720
 Even better than the E 50 M for crashes 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.140
 The collision point of each tank is determined when the tank collides 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.140
 Damage is based on this point. 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.450
 Damage is determined by calculating several things 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.140
 The most important thing is the weight, speed 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.670
 The thickness of the glove 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.450
 The AMX 50 B is a perfect blend of these three, which is very good at crashing 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.650
 It was defenseless, but it responded in time. 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.360
 It's easy prey. 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.460
 I need to look around. 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.470
 If you're lucky, you'll be able to take a break. 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.520
 I have no luck. 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.710
 When I was reloading, the enemy appeared in front of me! 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.300
 I can not defeat an enemy with a single clip. 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.530
 If you can get the enemy first, the horse will be different. 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.610
 The gun itself has very good performance 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.830
 The reload speed is very fast 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.930
 Higher hit rate. 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.560
 There is enough penetration and the angle of the base is fine. 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.090
 You can effectively attack from near or far 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.660
 The AMX 50 B is a true warrior 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.930
 A true warrior will never tolerate mistakes. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.850
 AMX 50 B former stepman 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.240
 AMX 50 100 or AMX 50 120 All 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.340
 It had similar characteristics. 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.730
 The AMX 50 B is not particularly new or shocking. 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.920
 If you make a mistake, you only have to pay a bigger price. 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.650
 Make decisions immediately on the move 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.000
 Do I have to go into town now or wait a bit? 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.770
 Do you want to shoot, retreat and reload, or take better opportunities? 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.980
 You have to deal with two enemy ships 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.360
 Or do you have to pour one clip into one durable trolley? 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.960
 You have to decide right away whether you want to cure the mangroves or the crew. 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.810
 We must always hide behind the friendly forces in close combat. 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.770
 When an enemy fires one foot, they must be able to pour the entire clip. 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.900
 I fired all the clips and retreated 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.940
 We need to find opportunities to reload 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.840
 Safe reloading to the AMX 50 B is the second most important thing 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.680
 The most important thing is finding a place to cover a huge body. 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.870
 If you can guess where the later battle tanks are, 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.520
 AMX 50 B becomes a hunter 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.760
 Track and attract targets, then defeat with confidence. 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.640
 The important thing is to keep a mini-map at your fingertips and keep it in the corner 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.210
 My ammo finally meet you! 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.890
 Why not shoot? 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.020
 He must be reloading like me. 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.530
 Good. Let's stay calm 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.620
 Shoot it! Try it! Come on! Hit me! 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.340
 If you can, do it! 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.940
 Is that all it is? 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.150
 Attack is like this! 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.570
 Good luck on the battlefield!
