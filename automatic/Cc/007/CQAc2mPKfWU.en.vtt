Wi-Fi it's going to take a few a while

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.320 
Wi-Fi it's going to take a few a while
to<00:05:34.550> activate<00:05:35.550> because<00:05:35.820> there's<00:05:35.970> so<00:05:36.240> many

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
to activate because there's so many

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.980 
to activate because there's so many
people<00:05:36.690> activating<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:38.630> access<00:05:39.630> point<00:05:39.870> so

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
people activating the access point so

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.690
