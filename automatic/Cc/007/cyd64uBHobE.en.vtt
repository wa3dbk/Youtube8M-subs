00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
friendly which is something that I look

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.899 
friendly which is something that I look
for<00:01:23.789> in<00:01:24.570> any<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> design<00:01:26.039> it<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
for in any kind of design it has to be

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.529 
for in any kind of design it has to be
able<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.749> made<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.200> survival<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.539> the

from<00:02:48.570> caving<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:49.170> put<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.740> chest<00:02:50.010> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
from caving just put it in a chest and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.470 
from caving just put it in a chest and
make<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:53.670> sorted<00:02:54.180> automatically<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
make it and be sorted automatically and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.720 
make it and be sorted automatically and
how<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.510> achieve<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.590> using<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.490> same

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
how I achieve this is using the same

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.050 
how I achieve this is using the same
system<00:03:00.180> with<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.600> hopper<00:03:01.400> about<00:03:02.400> increasing

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
system with the hopper about increasing

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.860 
system with the hopper about increasing
or<00:03:03.510> decreasing<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:05.040> signal<00:03:05.520> strength

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
or decreasing the signal strength

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.730 
or decreasing the signal strength
increasing<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.990> length<00:03:07.280> from<00:03:08.280> where<00:03:08.550> the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
increasing the length from where the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.620 
increasing the length from where the
signal<00:03:10.740> comes<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.760> there<00:03:12.000> are<00:03:12.030> four<00:03:12.330> blocks

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
signal comes so there are four blocks

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.880 
signal comes so there are four blocks
away<00:03:13.430> meaning<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.610> if<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.620> three<00:03:16.620> full

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
away meaning that if there is three full

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.130 
away meaning that if there is three full
stacks<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.550> one<00:03:18.480> stack<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.050> 62<00:03:19.820> off<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.900> could

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
stacks and one stack of 62 off it could

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.170 
stacks and one stack of 62 off it could
be<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.650> item<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.340> could<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.850> something

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
be the same item it could be something

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.240 
be the same item it could be something
else<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:26.010> something<00:03:26.460> that<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.750> expect<00:03:28.710> not

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
else and something that you expect not

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.910 
else and something that you expect not
to<00:03:29.520> come<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:29.910> your<00:03:30.360> system<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:34.320> sixty<00:03:34.740> two

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
to come in your system and so sixty two

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.280 
to come in your system and so sixty two
and<00:03:35.130> three<00:03:35.580> full<00:03:35.760> stacks<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.330> then<00:03:36.570> one<00:03:37.020> of

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and three full stacks and then one of

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.760 
and three full stacks and then one of
what<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.860> want<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:39.510> with<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.290> signal

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
what you want and that with that signal

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.350 
what you want and that with that signal
string<00:03:41.040> if<00:03:41.580> i<00:03:42.360> add<00:03:42.660> one<00:03:43.350> item<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:44.360> activates

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
string if i add one item it activates

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.490 
string if i add one item it activates
the<00:03:45.930> system<00:03:47.090> now<00:03:48.090> what<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.570> system<00:03:48.780> does<00:03:49.020> in

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the system now what the system does in

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.240 
the system now what the system does in
short<00:03:50.210> it<00:03:51.210> puts<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.690> minecart<00:03:52.290> here<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.740> then

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
short it puts the minecart here and then

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.480 
short it puts the minecart here and then
put<00:03:53.490> it<00:03:53.610> back<00:03:53.960> it<00:03:54.960> for<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.380> very<00:03:55.860> short<00:03:56.010> while<00:03:56.280> if

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
put it back it for a very short while if

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.480 
put it back it for a very short while if
there<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.060> only<00:03:57.270> one<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:58.140> we<00:03:58.320> could<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.710> 13

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
there is only one but we could put 13

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.270 
there is only one but we could put 13
and<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.910> would<00:04:00.150> stay<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.890> then<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.010> could<00:04:02.130> go

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and it would stay and then you could go

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.710 
and it would stay and then you could go
back<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:04.220> as<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.400> saw<00:04:05.640> there<00:04:05.880> were<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.210> hopper

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
back and as you saw there were a hopper

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.890 
back and as you saw there were a hopper
beneath<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.530> debt<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.150> putting<00:04:09.510> stuff

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
beneath the debt and it is putting stuff

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.550 
beneath the debt and it is putting stuff
in<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.290> chest<00:04:10.680> down<00:04:11.010> here<00:04:11.780> now<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:13.110> could<00:04:13.380> be

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
in a chest down here now that could be

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.479 
in a chest down here now that could be
your<00:04:14.040> dispenser<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:15.030> dispensing<00:04:15.840> out<00:04:16.280> items<00:04:17.280> in

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
your dispenser a dispensing out items in

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.170 
your dispenser a dispensing out items in
a<00:04:17.850> water<00:04:18.600> system<00:04:19.070> or<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.280> could<00:04:20.489> simply<00:04:20.850> be

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
a water system or this could simply be

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.480 
a water system or this could simply be
your<00:04:21.480> chest<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:23.690> planks

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.909 

now<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.669> is<00:04:28.730> actually<00:04:29.240> pretty<00:04:29.900> simple<00:04:30.200> at

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
now this is actually pretty simple at

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.310 
now this is actually pretty simple at
the<00:04:31.100> single<00:04:31.400> put<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.790> signal<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.810> converted

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
the single put a signal is converted

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.280 
the single put a signal is converted
into<00:04:33.950> one<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.639> Pistons<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.290> nothing

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
into one of the Pistons and nothing

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.580 
into one of the Pistons and nothing
verted<00:04:36.740> but<00:04:37.070> put<00:04:37.910> into<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.389> monostable<00:04:38.990> circuit

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
verted but put into a monostable circuit

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.330 
verted but put into a monostable circuit
into<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.310> other<00:04:40.580> piston<00:04:41.800> now<00:04:42.800> there<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.130> a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
into the other piston now there is a

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.000 
into the other piston now there is a
rail<00:04:43.820> beneath<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:45.080> mine<00:04:45.770> cart<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:47.710> two<00:04:48.710> rails

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
rail beneath the mine cart and two rails

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.760 
rail beneath the mine cart and two rails
in<00:04:49.340> front<00:04:49.669> of<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.230> because<00:04:51.410> a

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
in front of it and that is because a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.110 
in front of it and that is because a
real<00:04:52.100> one<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.610> face<00:04:52.820> this<00:04:53.810> direction<00:04:54.850> which<00:04:55.850> is

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
real one to face this direction which is

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.260 
real one to face this direction which is
north<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.910> wanted<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.840> face<00:05:00.080> fat<00:05:00.650> South

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
north and I wanted to face fat South

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.960 
north and I wanted to face fat South
because<00:05:02.270> if<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.660> is<00:05:02.690> facing<00:05:03.320> north<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:04.190> mine

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
because if it is facing north the mine

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.960 
because if it is facing north the mine
court<00:05:05.300> will<00:05:05.660> jiggle<00:05:06.139> about<00:05:06.470> and<00:05:06.800> kind<00:05:07.460> of<00:05:07.639> get

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
court will jiggle about and kind of get

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.770 
court will jiggle about and kind of get
stuck<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.510> places<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.169> it<00:05:10.010> is<00:05:10.160> not<00:05:10.490> stable<00:05:10.880> so

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
stuck in places and it is not stable so

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.070 
stuck in places and it is not stable so
with<00:05:12.080> this<00:05:12.290> edition<00:05:13.070> it<00:05:13.250> is<00:05:13.460> now<00:05:13.669> very<00:05:14.080> very

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
with this edition it is now very very

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.120 
with this edition it is now very very
stable<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:17.000> we<00:05:17.120> can<00:05:17.590> kind<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.740> show<00:05:18.919> that

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
stable and so we can kind of show that

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:27.610 
stable and so we can kind of show that
by<00:05:20.710> throwing<00:05:21.710> items<00:05:22.310> at<00:05:23.090> random<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:26.470> as<00:05:27.470> you

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
by throwing items at random and as you

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.520 
by throwing items at random and as you
see<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.130> is<00:05:28.630> working<00:05:29.630> going<00:05:29.780> back<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.260> forth

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
see it is working going back and forth

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.219 
see it is working going back and forth
not<00:05:31.010> getting<00:05:31.490> stuck<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.180> there's<00:05:32.390> still<00:05:32.600> one

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
not getting stuck and there's still one

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.930 
not getting stuck and there's still one
item<00:05:33.890> here<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:35.530> everything<00:05:36.530> went<00:05:37.010> down<00:05:37.490> into

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
item here and everything went down into
