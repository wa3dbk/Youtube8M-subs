00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.360
 When a message arrives that you are saying, you sing, the plants meet 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.710
 the success but but I do not get to put the truth in the stomach 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.879
 Montevideo 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.059
 to the two 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.799
 I congratulate you for 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.470
 Well, you have to work 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 don raul quintanilla 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.899
 Ok here 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.749
 I just had to listen to a singleton nothing not a song 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.740
 d a song has to be understood there really is the environment to understand if not 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.629
 it is understood by the production and if there is no other option for a little dryness 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.580
 distance and then an artist who is working distances an artist 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.500
 elementary 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.580
 I just heard an elementary interpretation 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.590
 not even for kunst and corny enough to say of 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.730
 knees I ask you the conselleries an exceptional foundation of life is a 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.970
 language of love and you really scared to stay 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.870
 short distance that truly when I'm in a song I do not know 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 learn a young tomatitas understand what they are singing 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330
 if they understand what that is 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 We are doing great pleasure I'm ready 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 In the waist architecture of the state of florida 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.960
 efe 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.970
 by the way we stick to spectacular port 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 not in port apero that actually 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.640
 all of it 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.670
 half 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.610
 you have to take care of the leadership 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.260
 you have to distinguish the different musical genres that you're going to sing 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.540
 and the leadership 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.540
 these n 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.070
 in this Spain ap 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.210
 my dear esteban 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.200
 to learn is to you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.210
 yes 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.650
 now I like it 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.540
 please take something my child measures 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.370
 because it is minimal 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.690
 I wait for you next week 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.690
 isea and her happy children 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.750
 for all 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.260
 I think that good day since instead of coming from criticism they put 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.749
 kindergarten 7 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.879
 can work because it also goes for the above 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.010
 because this time 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.759
 china imported work 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.229
 look what happened 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.589
 this is all that this can dominate a waste of resources 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.499
 imagine that this two were alone 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.339
 singing this song 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:31.869
 in this empty forum 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.539
 without bus resources 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.519
 yes all the production here 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.069
 and if people who can give you feedback about their 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.119
 work 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.809
 I believe that the - results would not be 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.349
 best of which fire 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.429
 and all this is very easy 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.259
 it's a paraphernalia 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.159
 what is done for you to look good 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.009
 but if they do not sing well 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.379
 and they do not move 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.769
 and among you they do not even do anything to get the attention of the public 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.349
 this is a waste of resources 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.929
 and then it makes people 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.069
 waste time 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.989
 I believe that nobody in this way likes to waste time 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.369
 I do not know what happened to a musical bridge 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.079
 that they stood still that they did not even give themselves 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.659
 enjoy when this song in Basque so that the two went out to dance 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.709
 they will take from the body and if they feel 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.439
 a theme to feel 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.170
 to the young people who were playing here the band also 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 they made him waste his time as he has a 20 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.559
 May until May as possible to win tennis 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.009
 pl 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:42.289
 nothing happened but it will not be easy after reading it as for him once 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.770
 what 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.280
 it was somewhat clear that he did not swallow them with his comment at the moment 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.279
 What I'm telling you is that in the hacienda the songs 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.410
 and if there is mediocrity of teaching inside the box the house
