00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
well I am going to close it with a lid

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.930 
well I am going to close it with a lid
and<00:02:44.480> cook<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:44.810> about<00:02:44.960> two<00:02:45.440> minutes<00:02:45.650> until<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
oil starts oozing out again so now you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.300 
oil starts oozing out again so now you
can<00:02:49.910> see<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.750> perfect<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> masalas<00:02:52.160> are

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
can see it is perfect the masalas are

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.100 
can see it is perfect the masalas are
all<00:02:52.520> observed<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.390> chicken<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.840> very

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
all observed and the chicken is very

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.410 
all observed and the chicken is very
flavorful<00:02:54.440> now<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.730> only<00:02:55.910> partly

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
flavorful now but it is only partly

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.630 
flavorful now but it is only partly
cooked<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> cook<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.830> well<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.100> am<00:02:58.310> going<00:02:58.490> to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
cooked so to cook it well I am going to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.110 
cooked so to cook it well I am going to
add<00:02:58.760> one<00:02:59.090> cup<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.570> water<00:02:59.630> to<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.190> also<00:03:01.880> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
add one cup of water to this so also the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.090 
add one cup of water to this so also the
consistency<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.840> very<00:03:03.050> dilute<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.740> obtain<00:03:04.070> a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
consistency is very dilute so obtain a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.000 
consistency is very dilute so obtain a
thick<00:03:04.940> consistency<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.900> also<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> cook<00:03:06.770> the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
thick consistency and also to cook the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.860 
thick consistency and also to cook the
chicken<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.670> am<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:08.210> to<00:03:08.300> allow<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.660> come

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
chicken I am going to allow it to come

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.610 
chicken I am going to allow it to come
to<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.110> boil

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
to a boil

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.860

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
and once it starts boiling I'm going to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.810 
and once it starts boiling I'm going to
close<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.380> lid<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.830> again<00:03:13.370> cook<00:03:13.580> for

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
close to the lid and again cook for

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.210 
close to the lid and again cook for
about<00:03:14.060> five<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.570> seven<00:03:14.960> minutes<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.680> now<00:03:16.040> you
