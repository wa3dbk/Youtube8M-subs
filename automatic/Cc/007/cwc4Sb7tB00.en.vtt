 welcome friends of minecraft 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.080
 to my new channel 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.790
 and this is my first video 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.790
 so please, I want you to support me 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.920
 your clients good today I will teach you 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.400
 how to make a piston first thing 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.009
 they have to have is 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.380
 wood subtract iron and pavers for 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.430
 that we go to the fretting table and 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.090
 we give 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090
 It was like that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.360
 let's see 3 wooden 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.620
 cobblestones on the sides 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.840
 reston down 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.840
 and iron and we will get a whistle 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.370
 I will also show you how to make a 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 sticky piston 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.030
 does the same when they already have the piston 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 see if you can get this ball 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.869
 of is line that is obtained I do not know if already 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.869
 they will have seen 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.930
 green games that appear in the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.930
 shores 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.460
 the water kills them and they throw that ball 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.490
 then they make more of the table 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.740
 grab the piston and put the ball 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.220
 sticky here 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.300
 up and gives them a very sticky piston 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 all right 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.870
 I'm going to show you how and how 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.680
 active 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.090
 whether for 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.600
 I have my farm a little bit that I made it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.600
 with pythons 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.509
 to activate a little bit more any 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.840
 good you have to have a button 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.070
 and for example 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.070
 on a stone behind him 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.570
 tighten and dry 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.480
 you can have it as well as there you will want 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.580
 have a connection 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 and for that they will need rest 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.980
 he confuses a lot he names 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.849
 do so he proved this case that turns like this 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.849
 longer 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.129
 and it is activated in the same case they will do with 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.790
 the sticky but the sticky and distinct 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.650
 why 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.650
 because it must fulfill the function 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.440
 of pushing the block that does 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.930
 He said 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.980
 he must push what pushes him and attracts him 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.920
 everyone realizes 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.250
 push thread back 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.330
 it can serve you for many things but 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.540
 for example here 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.080
 there is pressure I have my automatic farm 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.230
 that I did it with billions and that they add up 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.230
 he pressed the button 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.060
 to the sugar cane 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.680
 and well that was all friends 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.099
 I hope you support me 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.580
 It's my new video and watching videos on my 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.350
 new channel 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.880
 give him the little hand up 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.730
 and good 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.670
 I'm going to upload more minecraft videos 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.670

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.670
