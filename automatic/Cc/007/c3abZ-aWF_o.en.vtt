in<00:00:07.360> this<00:00:07.540> lesson<00:00:07.840> we're<00:00:08.170> going<00:00:08.350> to<00:00:08.440> be<00:00:08.559> looking

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
in this lesson we're going to be looking

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.619 
in this lesson we're going to be looking
at<00:00:09.130> what<00:00:09.430> is<00:00:09.520> perhaps<00:00:09.730> the<00:00:10.030> most<00:00:10.299> fundamental

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:10.629 
at what is perhaps the most fundamental

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.890 
at what is perhaps the most fundamental
scale<00:00:11.320> for<00:00:12.070> every<00:00:12.309> musician<00:00:12.760> to<00:00:12.940> know<00:00:13.090> the

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
scale for every musician to know the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.560 
scale for every musician to know the
major<00:00:14.110> scale<00:00:14.500> we<00:00:15.340> will<00:00:15.460> also<00:00:15.670> analyze<00:00:16.059> why

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
major scale we will also analyze why

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.859 
major scale we will also analyze why
major<00:00:16.840> scales<00:00:17.290> sound<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.980> way<00:00:18.070> they<00:00:18.250> do<00:00:18.869> let's

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
major scales sound the way they do let's

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.800 
major scales sound the way they do let's
begin<00:00:20.259> by<00:00:20.439> starting<00:00:20.650> with<00:00:20.829> the<00:00:21.040> C<00:00:21.250> major<00:00:21.460> scale

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
begin by starting with the C major scale

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.420 
begin by starting with the C major scale
we<00:00:22.810> are<00:00:22.840> starting<00:00:23.320> with<00:00:23.349> this<00:00:23.619> scale<00:00:23.980> because

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
we are starting with this scale because

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.310 
we are starting with this scale because
all<00:00:24.610> of<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:24.849> notes<00:00:25.060> are<00:00:25.210> natural<00:00:25.660> which<00:00:25.960> is<00:00:26.140> to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
all of the notes are natural which is to

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.260 
all of the notes are natural which is to
say<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.800> none<00:00:27.009> of<00:00:27.040> them<00:00:27.279> are<00:00:27.489> either<00:00:27.759> sharp

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.620 
between one note and the very next just
as<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.829> words<00:01:27.070> imply<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.549> greater<00:01:28.060> interval

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
as the words imply the greater interval

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.260 
as the words imply the greater interval
of<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.960> whole<00:01:29.170> tone<00:01:29.469> is<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:30.310> same<00:01:30.610> as<00:01:30.880> two

of a whole tone is the same as two

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.660 
of a whole tone is the same as two
semitones<00:01:31.689> at<00:01:32.140> this<00:01:33.009> point<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.490> would<00:01:33.610> be

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
semitones at this point it would be

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.760 
semitones at this point it would be
helpful<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.210> take<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.539> moment<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.079> look<00:01:35.590> at<00:01:35.710> a

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
helpful to take a moment and look at a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.720

where we can plainly see the
side-by-side<00:01:40.420> semitone<00:01:41.420> interval<00:01:41.960> from<00:01:42.200> E<00:01:42.410> to

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
and B to C teedo notice how a black key

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.670 
and B to C teedo notice how a black key
separates<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.720> rest<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> white<00:01:54.380> keys

separates the rest of the white keys

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.740 
separates the rest of the white keys
producing<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.400> larger<00:01:55.820> interval<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.570> whole
