00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and the widest one weighs just 220 grams

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.240 
and the widest one weighs just 220 grams
it's<00:00:57.239> made<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> carbon<00:00:58.050> composite<00:00:59.010> shell

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's made of a carbon composite shell

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.389 
it's made of a carbon composite shell
and<00:00:59.550> it's<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.570> two<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.140> uptight<00:01:01.320> omean<00:01:02.160> rails

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and it's got two bit uptight omean rails

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
and it's got two bit uptight omean rails
so<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> remains<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.540> really<00:01:04.110> light<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so it remains a really really light and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.820 
so it remains a really really light and
this<00:01:05.220> top<00:01:05.520> section<00:01:05.940> here<00:01:05.970> has<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> nanotech

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this top section here has got a nanotech

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.639 
this top section here has got a nanotech
coating<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> water<00:01:09.119> resistant<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
coating which is water resistant now the

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.070 
coating which is water resistant now the
tech<00:01:11.009> beer<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.700> adds<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.149> comfort<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
tech beer that adds to the comfort is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
tech beer that adds to the comfort is
twofold<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.549> first<00:01:14.760> thing<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
twofold really the first thing is this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
twofold really the first thing is this
some<00:01:15.900> sort<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> memory<00:01:16.830> foam<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.520> these<00:01:18.030> pads

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
some sort of memory foam in these pads

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.560 
some sort of memory foam in these pads
here<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.830> does<00:01:20.040> mold<00:01:20.430> itself<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
here and it really does mold itself to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.200 
here and it really does mold itself to
the<00:01:21.860> support<00:01:22.860> area<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.430> important<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the support area that's important on

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.260 
the support area that's important on
your<00:01:24.600> butt<00:01:24.960> cheeks<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> does<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.939> good

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
your butt cheeks and does a really good

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.840 
your butt cheeks and does a really good
job<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> real<00:01:28.770> techie<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.430> as

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
job of that but the real techie bit as

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.320 
job of that but the real techie bit as
if<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.840> take<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> look<00:01:31.290> side<00:01:31.860> profile<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
if we take a look side profile of the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.090 
if we take a look side profile of the
seat<00:01:33.570> you'll<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.619> section

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
seat you'll see there's a little section

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.730 
seat you'll see there's a little section
here<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.780> where<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.140> private

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
here and this is where your private

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
here and this is where your private
parts<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> rest<00:01:39.150> while<00:01:39.509> you're

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
parts are going to rest while you're

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
parts are going to rest while you're
cycling<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:41.400> underneath<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.689> little

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
cycling now underneath there's a little

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.100 
cycling now underneath there's a little
pump<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> white<00:01:44.610> part<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pump this is a white part here and if I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.460 
pump this is a white part here and if I
pump<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.970> adding<00:01:48.210> air<00:01:48.720> into

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
pump this up is actually adding air into

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.010 
pump this up is actually adding air into
the<00:01:49.590> chambers<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.840> give<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the chambers in here so we're give it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.490 
the chambers in here so we're give it
about<00:01:52.079> sort<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> 12<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.520> 15<00:01:54.060> pumps<00:01:54.570> something

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
about sort of 12 to 15 pumps something

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.399 
about sort of 12 to 15 pumps something
like<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.729> adding<00:01:57.210> resistance<00:01:58.079> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
like that and it's adding resistance in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.069 
like that and it's adding resistance in
this<00:01:58.680> mid<00:01:59.009> section<00:01:59.310> let's<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> bit<00:02:00.540> harder

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this mid section let's go a bit harder

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.420 
this mid section let's go a bit harder
still<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:03.329> there<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.740> pumped<00:02:05.310> up

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
still and there it's really pumped up

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
still and there it's really pumped up
quite<00:02:05.820> tight<00:02:06.149> now<00:02:06.420> let's<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> little<00:02:07.229> bit

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
quite tight now let's do a little bit

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.030 
quite tight now let's do a little bit
more<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:09.959> we've<00:02:10.079> got<00:02:10.170> some<00:02:10.229> real<00:02:10.619> firm

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
more and then we've got some real firm

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.259 
more and then we've got some real firm
support<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.880> there

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
support in there

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.660 
support in there
now<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.959> you've<00:02:13.110> pumped<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.590> too<00:02:13.829> much<00:02:14.100> there's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
now if you've pumped up too much there's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.800 
now if you've pumped up too much there's
a<00:02:14.820> release<00:02:15.390> valve<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:18.060> allows<00:02:18.389> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
a release valve here and that allows the
