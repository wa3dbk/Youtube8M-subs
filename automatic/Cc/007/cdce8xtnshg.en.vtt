00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.610
 in uteca rings 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.510
 Hello my family here I bring you a 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.640
 construction paper project and 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.790
 let's use a cedÃ© to 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.940
 basically form what would be a 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.210
 circle and we're going to use this for 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.090
 do a kind of oriental decoration I'm going 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.309
 now to cut the circle and once 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.879
 have the circle already cut 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.699
 then I will proceed to cut the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.830
 other parts for my circle that 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.560
 basically it's going to be in the form of how 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.860
 a Chinese light bulb 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.210
 and basically we're going to cut a strip 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.820
 of paper thin 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.299
 in order to do the top part 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.300
 and the bottom of my lamp 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.790
 China 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.210
 and this can be used for any 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.640
 kind of occasion for one to put his name 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 to not put symbols for example I 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.400
 I put some things written in Arabic and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.410
 that was the project I did with my 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.240
 students last week and basically 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.000
 I decided this week to just put my 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 own name in addition to putting different 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.020
 things in the middle can not put 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.600
 messages like peace love friendship greetings 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.800
 that kind of thing what I'm going to do 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.800
 here is to put my name 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.350
 and if you want you can also decorate 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.970
 with other things like for example with 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 glitter or with stickers or stickers or 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.200
 diamond and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.900
 with a clipping papers and what can 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.140
 do with my circle now is to give the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.760
 shape of a fan 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.900
 and we are giving it the shape of a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.750
 fan and 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.019
 in this way is a little folded in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.430
 the medium and it seems a little more like 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.939
 an Asian lamp 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.670
 once you get my balloon in the form of 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.240
 fan now what I do is paste 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.730
 top part and bottom part 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.660
 and for this I'm going to use a little bit of 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.660
 glue 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.430
 we paste it on the bottom and 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.189
 we put a little bit of glue in the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.620
 part of above this is a good project 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.950
 easy which can be done en masse 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.319
 for the teachers since I know a lot 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.409
 teacher want to do easy projects 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.840
 and most of the people who see my 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.340
 teachers are eager so this is a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.540
 project they can do with the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.579
 students and at home also if they do not have 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.299
 many materials only have paper 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.409
 or cardboard can also do it here 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:28.139
 I have a piece of thread which by 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:32.480
 which cut to basically put in the 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.480
 part of above and then hang 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.490
 small decoration here 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.040
 now I made the decoration with the 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.960
 my name and I will also show it 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.260
 one of a decoration that I made 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.020
 previously and basically has the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.600
 symbols of peace solved a little bit 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.350
 because the snag has dried us yet and 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.810
 says peace in Chinese and my name on the side 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.760
 left what 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.160
 left and right on the right side 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.750
 which is green I hope you liked it 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.750
 a lot of the video see you later
