00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:13.480
 unboxing of the mother card 970 of 32 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.299
 gb with md chip 970 ultra durable 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.039
 two phases of power four plus one to three 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.519
 years of warranty you know here in Mexico 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.929

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.609
 Well, let's see what it is that 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.640
 I bring I do not know is a version says that already 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.130

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.720

 as you can see is the version if it is that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.450
 I find it does not come the version well 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.310
 revision 1.4 we are going to open it first 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 when we are going to find the guarantee 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.600
 from gigabyte to us we are interested without 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.150
 No cost remember here in Mexico 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.980
 You can send the direct gigabyte in your 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.250
 three years of guarantee and they are going to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 repair with another and two cables sata one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.390
 with termination in l 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.259
 your input and output back panel 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.310
 his instructive user manual of the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.160
 mother card with your disk 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.820
 installation made this disc also 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.440
 you can use it in a 990 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.229
 because they are the same drivers 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.530
 directly multilanguage the manual 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.130
 of installation monti languages ​​for 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 remove the a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.980
 stamped for our cabinet 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.320
 and so 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.390
 if you can do that is all it brings 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.490
 with only one father 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.600
 as you can see as always in your 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 anti static bag 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 and here is the mother card 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.229
 a little bit this for what 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.569
 can see the mother card better 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.830
 its four expansion doors for the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.890
 ram memory up to 1866 native with a 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.080
 efe former 24-pin driver 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.080
 ideal marc socket am3 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 two 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.130
 its 8 connector retention plate 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.440
 pins in the ideal 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.960
 an expansion port is what I do not 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.540
 like some gigabyte models of 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.600
 done I have a 990 fx av of 5 and 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.010
 I have that same problem this port of 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.470
 expansion for example this pci-express 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.660
 what is happening here that we have to 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.580
 use a very small card is one of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.280
 expansion that is fix the size 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.530
 minimum so we can use it this 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 port but practically remains null and 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.360
 it's my plate I still have more space 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.750
 over here but I have a USB 3.0 card 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.720
 internal which I could not put here 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.630
 because I'm almost missing 2 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.310
 millimeters to fit when here 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.960
 we have the first pci expansion port 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:21.860
 express x16 other two pci-express x16 te 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.660
 from here below works x4 because two pci 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.460
 old school express 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.950
 it's good to see these because there are still 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.730
 many that we can get to occupy 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.260
 here are your phases of power 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.440
 As you can see here are 4 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.280
 and four phases of power 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.610
 and here is the other 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.370
 + 1 then a connector for fan 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.940
 another connector for fan 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.120
 and I do not see more 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.549
 here below there is another 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.069
 it seems to me that nothing else is three 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.420
 there are four here is the other not all 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.180
 pipelines for the panel 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.330
 input and output 108 decibels in audio 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.140
 it's not good enough it's good we can 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.230
 see brings three internal 2.0 usb this is 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.280
 the one that serves as extra cargo is the one 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.410
 comes with it or not 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.489
 church 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:24.610
 and then let's see rear panel 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:32.520
 as you can see we have two usb are 24 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:35.970
 688 usb 2.0 I quite like 2 usb 3.0 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.009
 its audio ps2 connector 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.680
 juanes optical audio analog audio 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.500
 up to 5.1 I'm not up to that 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.770
 7.1 this goes up to 5.1 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.360
 Well, it 's a motherboard that 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.770
 I liked it enough here we have the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.569
 sata connectors on this side 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.759
 they are all sata3 are 6 in total this 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.819
 motherboard comes very well the cost 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.280
 You can hang around in Mexico Let's see 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.509
 to talk in dollars more or less between 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.030
 the 100 and 110 dollars plus or minus one 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.919
 very good choice is good in 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.050
 najmedin I really like this kind of 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.729
 clear motherboards and then use to 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.220
 gaming this can be a very good 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.710
 option the back panel as you can see 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.569
 nothing is wasted we 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.240
 only what we need we do not have 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:30.090
 video connector because he forgot what 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.380
 let's take out for a video card and 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:39.840
 well this was boxing from 971 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:42.319
 32 gb unforgiven 970 of 3 gb until the 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.319
 next
