 a couple of garlic cloves in small pieces 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:41.000
 on rubles about 400 grams of cheese on 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.000
 grater already rubbed 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.829
 more pot 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.110
 salt water as it should and pour 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.989
 there pasta form pasta does not have 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 values 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:05.119
 but it is not desirable that they were long 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 spaghetti type took the roasting formula 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.070
 sprinkle with olive oil for about minutes 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.729
 six checking pasta 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.180
 they have become a little plastic and 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.020
 recommended cooking time is 12 minutes 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.850
 this state is just enough 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.460
 after six minute cooking with him 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:35.360
 stop cooking them they come at 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:35.360
 baking stacking their shape 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.530
 went garlic 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:08.009
 went family also 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.610
 oregano and pour the whole thing cream 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 cream used then pack everything 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:31.350
 still under its always tastier 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:33.750
 a dish that is salted enough sir i 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.140
 already said 400 grams has become inexpensive 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.100
 cheese is relatively inexpensive 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.520
 Ukrainian production in this case 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.650
 a little nutmeg 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.660
 raw materials by the way bought for 320 rubles for 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.720
 kilogram but I buy in those places where 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.420
 It is sold by the heads, so you can 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.920
 buy cheap by type wholesale 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.960
 quite decent quality invest 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.090
 sprinkle on top 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.290
 olive oil 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 still a little black pepper added and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.860
 send in the oven well about 200 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.480
 degrees 195 like this and hold for 20 minutes 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.200
 then a few more minutes to her ball 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.610
 above all this dish cost less 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:37.900
 than 300 rubles in modern times and 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.900
 and do not work badly but not figs do 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:50.290
 it can be served 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.440
 the combination of bread and cheese and the classic 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.830
 next to the taste of this option is that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.830
 seen in the course 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.510
