00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
your ruffle pattern since I wanted to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
have a full gather I will make it three

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.420 
have a full gather I will make it three
times<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.390> wide<00:00:27.540> as<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.720> sleeves<00:00:28.020> edge<00:00:28.430> after

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
times as wide as the sleeves edge after

selecting the rectangle tool left click

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
selecting the rectangle tool left click
on<00:00:31.200> the<00:00:31.290> pattern<00:00:31.439> window<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.130> type<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
on the pattern window and type in the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:42.000 
on the pattern window and type in the
exact<00:00:33.390> numbers<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.079> want

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.090 

and<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.700> height<00:00:42.880> can<00:00:43.149> be<00:00:43.620> anything<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:44.800> you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
and the height can be anything that you

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:53.900 
and the height can be anything that you
wanted<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.550> be<00:00:47.460> okay

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.180 

start<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.750> pattern<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.290> with<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> particle

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
start this pattern off with the particle

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:09.310 
start this pattern off with the particle
distance<00:00:56.400> of<00:00:56.579> 20<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.930> medium<00:00:58.290> cloth<00:00:58.670> preset

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.130 

and<00:01:09.440> then<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.310> want<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.520> position<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.810> ruffle

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
and then you want to position the ruffle

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.540 
and then you want to position the ruffle
pattern<00:01:12.410> next<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> sleep<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.340> cloth

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
pattern next to the sleep and the cloth

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.930 
pattern next to the sleep and the cloth
when<00:01:13.730> done<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:17.240> we<00:01:17.450> could<00:01:17.570> just<00:01:18.910> use<00:01:19.910> some

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
when done so we could just use some

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.789 
when done so we could just use some
generic<00:01:20.570> arrangement<00:01:21.170> points<00:01:21.500> there

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.830 

now<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.979> offset<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
now you want to offset this just a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.249 
now you want to offset this just a
little<00:01:33.929> bit<00:01:34.939> this<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> simulation

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
little bit this will make the simulation

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.630 
little bit this will make the simulation
go<00:01:37.469> smoother<00:01:38.539> since<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.750> pattern<00:01:40.289> isn't

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
go smoother since the pattern isn't

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.859 
go smoother since the pattern isn't
colliding<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:42.179> itself<00:01:42.569> too<00:01:43.170> much<00:01:44.569> so<00:01:45.569> do

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
colliding with itself too much so do

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.529 
colliding with itself too much so do
that<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> go<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.969> under<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
that you want to go here under the

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.709 
that you want to go here under the
property<00:01:48.899> editor<00:01:49.969> let's<00:01:50.969> change<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.299> offset

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
property editor let's change this offset

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.090 
property editor let's change this offset
just<00:01:52.289> make<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:52.709> little<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:53.130> bigger<00:01:55.700> okay

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
just make a little bit bigger okay

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.160 
just make a little bit bigger okay
so<00:01:58.700> now<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:58.880> want<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.180> segment<00:01:59.630> so<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.960> top

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
so now you want a segment so the top

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:10.270 
so now you want a segment so the top
edge<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.560> ruffle<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> sleeve<00:02:01.520> edge

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.370 

and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.390> edge<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> ruffle

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and then so the edge of the ruffle

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.699 
and then so the edge of the ruffle
closed

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.399 

and<00:02:19.250> change<00:02:19.700> these<00:02:20.060> same<00:02:21.049> folds<00:02:23.109> give<00:02:24.109> them<00:02:24.260> an

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
and change these same folds give them an

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:32.559 
and change these same folds give them an
angle<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:24.890> 360<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.500> we'll<00:02:31.060> give<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> nice

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
angle of 360 so we'll give you a nice

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.379 
angle of 360 so we'll give you a nice
indentation<00:02:33.140> here<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.920> here<00:02:34.189> once<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
indentation here and here once the

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:41.870 
indentation here and here once the
protocole<00:02:35.930> distance<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.349> higher

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:57.910 

and<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:43.050> need<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:44.600> simulate

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.300 

and<00:02:58.460> if<00:02:58.580> you're<00:02:58.730> happy<00:02:59.090> with<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.360> look<00:03:00.310> change

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
and if you're happy with the look change

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.580 
and if you're happy with the look change
protocol<00:03:01.760> distance<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.360> five

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.170 

and<00:03:09.920> The<00:03:10.920> Presets<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.490> something<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.910> drapes

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and The Presets is something that drapes

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.420 
and The Presets is something that drapes
more<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.660> silk

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.449 

and<00:03:20.909> now<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.569> completed<00:03:22.459> playing

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
and now you have a completed playing

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.329 
and now you have a completed playing
straight<00:03:23.909> ruffle
