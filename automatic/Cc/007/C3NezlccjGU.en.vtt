anything in terms of its ability to
raise<00:01:28.090> testosterone<00:01:28.329> so<00:01:28.990> that's<00:01:29.170> two<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
raise testosterone so that's two of the

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.800 
raise testosterone so that's two of the
three<00:01:30.189> ingredients<00:01:30.420> couldn't<00:01:31.420> find<00:01:31.569> anything

three ingredients couldn't find anything

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.870 
three ingredients couldn't find anything
that<00:01:32.200> showed<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.159> it<00:01:33.490> can<00:01:33.639> increase

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
that showed that it can increase

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.719 
that showed that it can increase
testosterone<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:35.829> least<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.459> peer-reviewed

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
testosterone at least in peer-reviewed

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.580

about<00:02:10.989> 250<00:02:11.590> grams<00:02:11.820> all<00:02:12.820> three<00:02:13.150> doses<00:02:13.360> did

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
about 250 grams all three doses did

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
about 250 grams all three doses did
increase<00:02:14.020> testosterone<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.740> rats<00:02:15.420> so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
increase testosterone and rats so

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.710 
increase testosterone and rats so
that's<00:02:17.190> one<00:02:17.400> thing<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> consider<00:02:17.820> now<00:02:18.450> pink

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that's one thing to consider now pink

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
sixteen hundred milligrams so we don't

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.910 
sixteen hundred milligrams so we don't

herb<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> product<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.720> took

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
herb is in the product now if we took

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
herb is in the product now if we took
those<00:02:25.230> dosages<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.010> extrapolated<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.760> out

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
those dosages and we extrapolated it out

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.420 
those dosages and we extrapolated it out
to<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> human<00:02:27.540> let's<00:02:28.110> say<00:02:28.230> an<00:02:28.320> 82<00:02:28.680> kilogram<00:02:29.160> male

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
to a human let's say an 82 kilogram male

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.510 
to a human let's say an 82 kilogram male
it's<00:02:29.820> about<00:02:30.000> 180<00:02:30.690> pounds<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:32.160> would<00:02:32.340> mean

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
it's about 180 pounds that would mean

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.090 
it's about 180 pounds that would mean
based<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.300> need<00:02:33.540> about<00:02:33.660> 20<00:02:34.410> grams<00:02:34.740> of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
based on that you need about 20 grams of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.540 
based on that you need about 20 grams of
this<00:02:35.670> herb<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.840> order<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.550> increase

slightly larger body builder closer to
about<00:03:04.170> 200<00:03:04.620> pounds<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.550> you're<00:03:05.910> still<00:03:06.180> not

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
about 200 pounds so you're still not

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.300

going to reach the for gram dosage now
some<00:03:08.850> people<00:03:08.880> say<00:03:09.330> well<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:10.230> don't<00:03:10.410> know<00:03:10.530> if

whole herb we don't even know what the
active<00:03:14.670> ingredient<00:03:15.210> is<00:03:15.360> based<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> study

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
active ingredient is based on the study

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.810 
active ingredient is based on the study
and<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.440> don't<00:03:16.590> understand<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> mechanism<00:03:17.610> so

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
and we don't understand the mechanism so

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.300 
and we don't understand the mechanism so
to<00:03:18.660> say<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.080> it's<00:03:19.590> still<00:03:19.830> you're<00:03:20.070> not<00:03:20.190> going

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
to say that it's still you're not going

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.340 
to say that it's still you're not going
to<00:03:20.370> get<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:21.060> gram<00:03:21.300> amount<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.140> just

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
to get that for gram amount so it's just

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.550 
to get that for gram amount so it's just
that's<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.860> feasible<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:25.020> know<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that's just not feasible you know in the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.050 
that's just not feasible you know in the
thing<00:03:26.100> with<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.640> that's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
thing with this is that that's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.490 
thing with this is that that's
disappointing<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.959> product<00:03:28.320> sells

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
disappointing this this product sells

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.130 
disappointing this this product sells
really<00:03:28.740> well<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:30.540> would<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.780> thought<00:03:30.930> by

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
really well and we would have thought by

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.270 
really well and we would have thought by
now<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.380> there<00:03:31.650> would<00:03:31.740> actually<00:03:31.830> be<00:03:32.130> some

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
now that there would actually be some

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.670 
now that there would actually be some
human<00:03:32.550> studies<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.000> validate<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:34.080> study

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
human studies to validate this a study

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.400 
human studies to validate this a study
on<00:03:34.860> rats<00:03:35.130> doesn't<00:03:35.520> cut<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.760> for<00:03:35.790> me<00:03:36.060> personally

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
on rats doesn't cut it for me personally

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.660 
on rats doesn't cut it for me personally
it's<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> criteria<00:03:38.070> we<00:03:38.220> use<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.490> judge

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
it's not the criteria we use to judge

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.920 
it's not the criteria we use to judge
supplements<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.330> like<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:39.540> said<00:03:39.690> there's<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
supplements and like we said there's a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.150 
supplements and like we said there's a
lot<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.170> these<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.530> been<00:03:40.680> sold<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.070> we

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
lot of these that have been sold so we

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.199 
lot of these that have been sold so we
would<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.520> there'd<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.850> some<00:03:42.000> actual

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
would think that there'd be some actual

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.360 
would think that there'd be some actual
human<00:03:42.570> studies<00:03:42.870> done<00:03:43.020> on<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.260> now<00:03:43.800> if<00:03:44.100> that's

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
human studies done on it now if that's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.890 
human studies done on it now if that's
enough<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.120> buy<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.300> that's<00:03:45.570> fine

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
enough for you to buy it that's fine

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.630 
enough for you to buy it that's fine
well<00:03:46.410> we'd<00:03:46.560> suggest<00:03:46.740> if<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.220> want<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> find

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
well we'd suggest if you want to find

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.010 
well we'd suggest if you want to find
out<00:03:47.820> if<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.000> works<00:03:48.209> for<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.900> does

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
out if it works for your not and does

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.750 
out if it works for your not and does
increase<00:03:49.350> testosterone<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.490> have<00:03:50.640> your

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
increase testosterone is to have your

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.160 
increase testosterone is to have your
blood<00:03:50.970> work<00:03:51.090> done<00:03:51.270> before<00:03:51.450> taking<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.020> and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
blood work done before taking it and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.870 
blood work done before taking it and
then<00:03:52.590> let's<00:03:52.770> say<00:03:52.950> about<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.190> month<00:03:53.430> month<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
then let's say about a month month and a

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.910 
then let's say about a month month and a
half<00:03:53.910> later<00:03:54.260> see<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:55.290> it's<00:03:55.500> gone<00:03:55.620> up<00:03:55.680> from

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
half later see if it's gone up from

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.470 
half later see if it's gone up from
there<00:03:56.130> that's<00:03:56.670> really<00:03:56.910> all<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.240> do

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
there that's really all you can do

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.210 
there that's really all you can do
because<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.870> don't<00:03:58.080> have<00:03:58.170> any<00:03:58.470> human<00:03:58.860> research

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
because we don't have any human research

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.790 
because we don't have any human research
to<00:03:59.459> validate<00:03:59.850> it<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.320> that's<00:04:01.320> that's<00:04:01.560> the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
to validate it so that's that's the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.840 
to validate it so that's that's the
follow<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.370> again<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.730> little

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
follow up on it again a little

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.160 
follow up on it again a little
disappointed<00:04:03.420> by<00:04:03.540> now<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.780> there<00:04:03.990> hasn't

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
disappointed by now that there hasn't

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.390 
disappointed by now that there hasn't
