00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.930
 hi hello kilian i hope you are 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.120
 pretty good and good we're in a 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.139
 review of a sit that the truth was 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.699
 quite curious and strange at the same time 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.300
 and well, they will say yes afterwards 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.740
 it's my name but sincere 919 good yo 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.199
 I had told them to put neither 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.199
 goal 20 919 in infinite worlds so that 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.810
 we had the same map but in some 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.790
 several subscribers even put 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.880
 nothing more lyon gold and he left a 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.470
 in a world even the world is the world 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.410
 old and here in sling world itself 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.550
 although we put that we must put here 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.260
 also the same name for not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.649
 confuse me 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.500
 I tell them it 's the old world and it's generated 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.539
 in a very curious way too 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.899
 curious ok if my creation does not have to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.329
 Why nothing happens is we re-enter 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.609
 here 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.409
 very well it is loading and as you can see 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.170
 we left just like that 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.330
 right in the village crib but that is 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.240
 The most curious thing is this kind of 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.520
 huge skyscrapers that I have no idea of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.229
 why they are here but just 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.439
 we are out behind this 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.479
 huge pure stone skyscraper swims 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.149
 more that is, it has nothing inside or nothing 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.830
 like that but he 's pretty curious 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.159
 because I tell them about the worlds 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.600
 old but they come out exactly in what 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.350
 it's a village by I say several 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.960
 subscribers were putting it in 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.020
 I even saw that many had already done 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.209
 there some video showing it and I said 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.470
 well it 's like a date with my 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.330
 name and I said well let's upload it 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.929
 because this curious I tell you they are worlds 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.039
 oldies but because they are put I think 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.600
 if they put a goal in infinite worlds 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.940
 not now it does not appear from this 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.909
 way is not generated in this way but 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.740
 it is generated in a very rare way or 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.049
 I'm weird my name is weird but 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.210
 well there would be also a 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.060
 half house 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.240
 a big one around here you should see the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.640
 crime two villagers allianz landmarks where 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.100
 are not you see them good out there they were 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.040
 I think therefore it will look in there 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.230
 there is one and one itself would be everything else 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.319
 this appointment that was put out there my 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.930
 name in old worlds and they came out of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.030
 this way is pretty funny 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.769
 and obviously you can not go to was him 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.650
 because actually there were too many 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.150
 and it would be quite a roll so that 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.680
 true exercises for showing is yes 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.319
 I was quite curious about salts 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.079
 directly in a village and nothing I hope 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.400
 that you liked it and we 'll see you in the 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.400
 next video see you later
