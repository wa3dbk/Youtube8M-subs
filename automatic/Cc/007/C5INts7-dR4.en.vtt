00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.150
 Tell us guys, let's bring another video today. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.240
 long journey only today I bring to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.850
 you a different gameplay because I am 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 one of the beta testers us the simulator and went 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.369
 authorized to make videos about it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.769
 first of all for those who have not read the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.120
 video title I'm going again to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:38.070
 you long route alpha test simulator 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.680
 of physics or is it more for a version 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
 pre-alpha is not an alpha version yet with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 an alpha version already has a pine cone over there 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.860
 for you to walk and here you will not take that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.899
 will have a differentiated map that you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.270
 will understand and on the shoulder of the video to 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.980
 that you can have a sense there too 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 of how physics is getting and some 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 other details 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.120
 the scenario is still in production and this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.609
 that you are seeing a scenario created 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 to test the physics where it has 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.920
 some ripples and there are also some 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.659
 springs for us to pass through 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.720
 and see how the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.060
 shock absorbers 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.880
 so you will not see big things 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.119
 in part graphic this scenario because 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.340
 still being worked on by the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 guys there that's developing the game 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 physics is still in development 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.780
 but what we can see is a good system 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 of damping and of course how physics 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.079
 It is still being developed 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 stability is also being 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.400
 developed there in the course of the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.189
 video you can see that the path that the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.530
 applauded dinha I kind of get one day 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.540
 jumped and mail that a tomb gives more 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 are things that are going to be fixed in the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.259
 time will not come like this in the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.579
 final version with the pre alpha but has 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.540
 people who do not understand have to talk about 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.939
 new 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.610
 you can see that the daytime system is 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.740
 night is also a bit fast one 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 little is not very fast is outside the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.969
 normal pattern , right but she thinks that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.880
 there was not even to come in this version 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.039
 he just put it there for myself I have a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.830
 Notion of how it is and show it to the people 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.590
 what is going to be day night sunrise on 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.750
 third and all these ends 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.459
 hence the damping system of the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.069
 The truck is very nice because 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.690
 who likes that realism in the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.660
 truck springs will find it well 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.300
 different from the current simulators not so 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 different let's say it's going to be similar 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.940
 the current ones with a Brazilian touch 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.970
 We do not have anything to talk about yet. 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.519
 cushioning of the cabin because she's there 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.660
 mine that in correcting some bugs in 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.720
 previous version 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.000
 we played with a version where we had 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.549
 the inside of the truck had some bugs 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.310
 and they preferred not to disclose 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.140
 while that part of indoor 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.170
 just an outside truck 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.970
 showing there physics improvement has a 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.379
 clarification for you to see 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.019
 how galley is at full steam 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.349
 modeling and creating more and correcting 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.510
 more Brazilian resources in the simulator 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.329
 remember that you do not have a date yet 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.030
 then do not stand 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.879
 asking when you left simulator 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.709
 but it should not be long, he did not see how 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.880
 the flood in your opinion do not forget 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.100
 to give one here in this video of 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.200
 share with your friends our short 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.720
 page on facebook also participate in the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.310
 our group if you want to stay more for 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.560
 within all the news about the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.530
 long route all links are here
