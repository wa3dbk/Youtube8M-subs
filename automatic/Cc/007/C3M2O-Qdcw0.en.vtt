00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.630 
side too then turn it over and we're
gonna<00:01:53.210> go<00:01:53.450> ahead<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.869> fold<00:01:54.710> in<00:01:55.069> the<00:01:55.310> bottom

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
gonna go ahead and fold in the bottom

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:07.569 
gonna go ahead and fold in the bottom
part<00:01:55.909> now<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.759> do<00:01:58.939> that<00:01:59.060> for<00:01:59.270> both<00:01:59.450> sides<00:02:06.579> so

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
part now and do that for both sides so

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.859 
part now and do that for both sides so
you<00:02:07.640> get<00:02:07.759> something<00:02:07.939> that<00:02:08.119> looks<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.539> this

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
you get something that looks like this

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.509 
you get something that looks like this
now<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:09.799> want<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.009> go<00:02:10.099> ahead<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.340> fold

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
now I want to go ahead and fold

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.430 
now I want to go ahead and fold
everything<00:02:10.789> in<00:02:11.030> half<00:02:11.209> but<00:02:11.599> keep<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
everything in half but keep that the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.640 
everything in half but keep that the
tree<00:02:12.680> part<00:02:12.920> facing<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.819> top<00:02:14.239> here<00:02:17.440> turn<00:02:18.440> things

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
tree part facing on top here turn things

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.860 
tree part facing on top here turn things
over<00:02:18.799> for<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> second<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.910> we'll<00:02:20.090> take<00:02:20.390> this

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
over for a second and we'll take this

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.390 
over for a second and we'll take this
bottom<00:02:21.260> part<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.620> fold<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:21.920> down<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
bottom part and fold it down and this is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.710 
bottom part and fold it down and this is
where<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:22.849> kind<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.150> decide<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.510> little

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
where you can kind of decide a little

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.630 
where you can kind of decide a little
bit<00:02:23.959> how<00:02:24.230> far<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.739> want<00:02:24.950> everything<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.400> fold

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
bit how far you want everything to fold

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.910 
bit how far you want everything to fold
down<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.180> how<00:02:26.690> long<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.170> want<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.560> bottom

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
down and how long you want that bottom

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.160 
down and how long you want that bottom
part<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> tree<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.670> be<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.090> then<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.840> fold

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
part of the tree to be and then you fold

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.949 
part of the tree to be and then you fold
back<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.799> part<00:02:31.099> up<00:02:31.340> depending<00:02:32.090> again<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.629> on

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
back this part up depending again to on

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.920 
back this part up depending again to on
how<00:02:33.950> much<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.430> want<00:02:34.579> it<00:02:34.610> showing<00:02:35.030> if<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.750> had

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
how much you want it showing if you had

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.170 
how much you want it showing if you had
folded<00:02:36.140> from<00:02:36.890> here<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.730> by<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:37.879> little

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
folded from here just just by a little

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.330 
folded from here just just by a little
bit<00:02:38.269> you'd<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> much<00:02:38.750> narrower<00:02:39.290> kind<00:02:40.069> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
bit you'd get a much narrower kind of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.949 
bit you'd get a much narrower kind of
little<00:02:40.790> base<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.209> your<00:02:41.269> tree<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.810> could

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
little base to your tree that you could

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.590 
little base to your tree that you could
fold<00:02:42.140> off<00:02:42.319> by<00:02:43.040> folding<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.850> down<00:02:43.880> farther<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
fold off by folding it down farther you

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.629 
fold off by folding it down farther you
get<00:02:44.750> more<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.109> wide<00:02:45.410> base<00:02:45.920> right<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
get more of a wide base right here so

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.770 
get more of a wide base right here so
that's<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.940> kind<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.329> you<00:02:47.389> guys<00:02:47.510> how<00:02:47.720> you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
prefer to do it and then just fold this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.030 
prefer to do it and then just fold this
part<00:02:50.090> back<00:02:50.329> depending<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.139> how<00:02:51.319> long<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.859> want

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
part back depending on how long you want

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.910 
part back depending on how long you want
it<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.220> be<00:02:52.370> as<00:02:52.459> well<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.239> these<00:02:54.079> can<00:02:54.410> be<00:02:54.560> great
