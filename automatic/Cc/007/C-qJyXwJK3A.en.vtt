selection and this is how you build your

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
selection and this is how you build your
fortifications<00:01:38.040> wherever<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> drag<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.420> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
construct those log wall blocks so let's

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.350 
construct those log wall blocks so let's
select<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.710> small<00:01:43.979> wall<00:01:44.220> area<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.210> can

designation that you've made so the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780

advantage<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> log<00:01:52.920> walls<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> they're

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
advantage of log walls is that they're

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.850 
advantage of log walls is that they're
the<00:01:53.909> quickest<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> build<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.530> require

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the quickest to build and they require

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
the quickest to build and they require
the<00:01:56.009> most<00:01:56.159> plentiful<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.759> resources<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the most plentiful of the resources the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.359 
the most plentiful of the resources the
downside<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:58.829> comparatively

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
downside is that they are comparatively

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.730 
downside is that they are comparatively
weaker<00:01:59.909> than<00:02:00.090> stone<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.570> brick<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.500> course

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
weaker than stone or brick and of course

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.760 
weaker than stone or brick and of course
what<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.070> much<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.490> flammable<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.350> plan<00:02:04.590> now

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
what is much more flammable the plan now

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
what is much more flammable the plan now
is<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.950> show<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.219> how<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> craft<00:02:05.670> bricks<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
is to show you how to craft bricks to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.080 
is to show you how to craft bricks to
use<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> building<00:02:07.200> material<00:02:07.849> first<00:02:08.849> I'll

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.520 
for the purposes of this video it'll be
small<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.280> it'll<00:03:01.579> do<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.870> set<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.230> digging

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
small and it'll do you set the digging

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.879 
small and it'll do you set the digging
area<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.829> same<00:03:04.040> way<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.310> do<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.519> building<00:03:04.909> area

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
area the same way you do a building area

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.929 
area the same way you do a building area
you've<00:03:06.889> probably<00:03:07.129> noticed<00:03:07.400> already<00:03:07.760> that

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
you've probably noticed already that

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.970 
you've probably noticed already that
design<00:03:08.510> zones<00:03:08.840> are<00:03:09.049> color<00:03:09.260> coded<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:09.829> can

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
design zones are color coded so you can

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.289 
design zones are color coded so you can
always<00:03:10.159> tell<00:03:10.370> what's<00:03:10.519> being<00:03:10.669> laid<00:03:10.939> out<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
always tell what's being laid out and

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.270 
always tell what's being laid out and
where<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.169> can<00:03:12.290> see<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.769> mining<00:03:13.069> zones

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
where as you can see the mining zones

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.729 
where as you can see the mining zones
are<00:03:13.459> red<00:03:13.780> as<00:03:14.780> soon<00:03:14.959> as<00:03:15.049> he's<00:03:15.169> finished<00:03:15.379> digging

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
are red as soon as he's finished digging

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.530 
are red as soon as he's finished digging
up<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:16.040> top<00:03:16.250> layer<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.579> Earth<00:03:16.790> I'll<00:03:17.209> have<00:03:17.419> him

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
up the top layer of Earth I'll have him

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.869 
up the top layer of Earth I'll have him
start<00:03:17.780> mining<00:03:18.169> into<00:03:18.409> the<00:03:18.530> stone<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:19.579> take<00:03:19.609> him

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
start mining into the stone to take him

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.219 
start mining into the stone to take him
a<00:03:19.940> second<00:03:20.239> because<00:03:20.329> he's<00:03:20.510> using<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> lowest

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
a second because he's using the lowest

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.589 
a second because he's using the lowest
quality<00:03:21.440> pickaxe<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.340> he's<00:03:22.609> quite<00:03:23.030> low<00:03:23.209> level

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
quality pickaxe and he's quite low level

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.240 
quality pickaxe and he's quite low level
and<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.229> looks<00:03:24.379> like<00:03:24.530> he's<00:03:24.680> about<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.949> gather

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and it looks like he's about to gather

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.649 
and it looks like he's about to gather
his<00:03:25.519> first<00:03:25.849> piece<00:03:27.939> so<00:03:28.939> let's<00:03:29.090> go<00:03:29.209> back<00:03:29.419> to<00:03:29.569> the

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
his first piece so let's go back to the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.210 
his first piece so let's go back to the
crafting<00:03:30.049> menu<00:03:30.169> and<00:03:30.409> have<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.620> stonemason

order<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.090> craft<00:03:41.329> two<00:03:41.569> bricks<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.109> requires

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
order to craft two bricks it requires

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.249 
order to craft two bricks it requires
one<00:03:42.739> raw<00:03:42.919> stone<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.459> one<00:03:43.579> dirt<00:03:44.109> so<00:03:45.109> let's

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
one raw stone and one dirt so let's

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.749 
one raw stone and one dirt so let's
craft<00:03:45.439> a<00:03:45.590> few<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.889> those<00:03:46.040> they<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.459> into<00:03:46.579> the

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:46.759 
craft a few of those they go into the

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.069 
craft a few of those they go into the
queue<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.150> stonemason<00:03:47.720> will<00:03:47.840> start

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
queue and the stonemason will start

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.189 
queue and the stonemason will start
working<00:03:48.409> now<00:03:49.239> if<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:50.299> remember<00:03:50.659> correctly<00:03:50.989> this

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
working now if I remember correctly this

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.080 
working now if I remember correctly this
stonemason<00:03:51.799> is<00:03:51.889> level<00:03:52.129> 5<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.699> bricks<00:03:52.909> are

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
stonemason is level 5 and the bricks are

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.849 
stonemason is level 5 and the bricks are
fairly<00:03:53.299> easy<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.720> craft<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.500> there's<00:03:54.680> very

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
fairly easy to craft so there's very

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.530 
fairly easy to craft so there's very
little<00:03:55.040> risk<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.459> him<00:03:55.639> failing<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.209> wasting

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
little risk of him failing and wasting

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.199 
little risk of him failing and wasting
my<00:03:56.659> resources<00:03:57.259> but<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.560> can<00:03:57.709> happen<00:03:58.209> first

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
my resources but it can happen first

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.550 
my resources but it can happen first
he'll<00:03:59.389> work<00:03:59.569> at<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> bench<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.290> then<00:04:00.379> he'll

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
he'll work at the bench and then he'll

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.170 
he'll work at the bench and then he'll
head<00:04:00.709> over<00:04:00.949> to<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.159> forge<00:04:01.459> which<00:04:01.849> I<00:04:01.970> still

missed it but I went into my

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.280 
missed it but I went into my
woodchoppers<00:04:07.669> unit<00:04:08.299> preferences<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.079> set

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
woodchoppers unit preferences and I set

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.080 
woodchoppers unit preferences and I set
them<00:04:09.379> to<00:04:09.500> continuously<00:04:10.159> independently<00:04:10.849> chop

them to continuously independently chop

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.420 
them to continuously independently chop
trees<00:04:11.299> for<00:04:12.290> some<00:04:12.439> reason<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:12.949> bothers<00:04:13.280> me

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
trees for some reason it just bothers me

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.800 
trees for some reason it just bothers me
to<00:04:13.549> have<00:04:13.669> him<00:04:13.759> sitting<00:04:14.030> around<00:04:14.150> doing<00:04:14.329> nothing

my<00:04:30.590> opinion<00:04:30.620> which<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.190> food<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.880> most

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
my opinion which is food and the most

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.550 
my opinion which is food and the most
basic<00:04:32.450> way<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.570> collect<00:04:32.960> food<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.380> gather

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
basic way to collect food is to gather

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.590 
basic way to collect food is to gather
it<00:04:33.800> with<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.040> forager<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:34.970> let's<00:04:35.120> go<00:04:35.240> into<00:04:35.450> his

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
it with the forager so let's go into his

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.470 
it with the forager so let's go into his
menu<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.380> tell<00:04:36.620> him<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.830> gather<00:04:37.100> berries

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
menu and tell him to gather berries

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.940 
menu and tell him to gather berries
he'll<00:04:38.480> then<00:04:38.690> find<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> closest<00:04:39.470> berry<00:04:39.680> bush

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
he'll then find the closest berry bush

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.070 
he'll then find the closest berry bush
and<00:04:40.520> gather<00:04:40.760> all<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.120> available<00:04:41.330> berries<00:04:41.840> and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
and gather all the available berries and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.900 
and gather all the available berries and
move<00:04:42.200> on<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.530> next<00:04:42.710> closest<00:04:43.130> bush<00:04:43.340> he'll

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
move on to the next closest bush he'll

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.050 
move on to the next closest bush he'll
do<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.180> until<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.450> tell<00:04:44.660> him<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.810> stop<00:04:46.060> when

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
do that until you tell him to stop when

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.190 
do that until you tell him to stop when
he's<00:04:47.150> finished<00:04:47.270> gathering<00:04:47.510> from<00:04:47.810> that<00:04:47.930> first

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
he's finished gathering from that first

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.140 
he's finished gathering from that first
bush<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:48.620> think<00:04:48.830> I'll<00:04:48.920> have<00:04:49.040> him<00:04:49.160> stop<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.670> then

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
bush I think I'll have him stop and then

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.430 
bush I think I'll have him stop and then
I'll<00:04:50.240> go<00:04:50.330> back<00:04:50.480> into<00:04:50.660> his<00:04:50.810> preferences<00:04:51.260> and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
I'll go back into his preferences and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.590 
I'll go back into his preferences and
show<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.680> his<00:04:51.920> boa<00:04:52.160> range<00:04:52.460> he's<00:04:53.240> using<00:04:53.510> a

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
show you his boa range he's using a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.720 
show you his boa range he's using a
short<00:04:53.840> bow<00:04:54.020> which<00:04:54.800> has<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:54.980> short<00:04:55.280> range<00:04:55.310> but

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
short bow which has a short range but

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.970 
short bow which has a short range but
it's<00:04:55.880> extremely<00:04:56.270> useful<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:57.110> accurate<00:04:57.740> for

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
it's extremely useful and accurate for

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.210 
it's extremely useful and accurate for
haunting<00:04:59.410> showing<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.500> range<00:05:00.710> is<00:05:00.890> especially

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
haunting showing the range is especially

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.100 
haunting showing the range is especially
useful<00:05:01.520> when<00:05:01.790> placing<00:05:02.060> archers<00:05:02.480> on<00:05:02.600> walls<00:05:02.840> but

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
useful when placing archers on walls but

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.930 
useful when placing archers on walls but
for<00:05:03.260> now<00:05:03.380> I'll<00:05:03.860> just<00:05:03.980> show<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.400> range<00:05:04.610> so<00:05:04.820> you

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
for now I'll just show the range so you

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.400 
for now I'll just show the range so you
can<00:05:05.060> see<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.360> this<00:05:05.510> chicken<00:05:05.870> is<00:05:05.960> about<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.290> be

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
can see that this chicken is about to be

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.030 
can see that this chicken is about to be
shot<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.860> or<00:05:07.070> around<00:05:07.280> its<00:05:07.460> face<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:09.620> forager

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
shot in or around its face the forager

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.560 
shot in or around its face the forager
will<00:05:10.160> then<00:05:10.310> go<00:05:10.490> collect<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.820> resources<00:05:11.060> from

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
will then go collect the resources from

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.970 
will then go collect the resources from
that<00:05:11.690> dead<00:05:11.900> chick<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.290> most<00:05:12.440> importantly<00:05:12.860> the

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
that dead chick and most importantly the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.160 
that dead chick and most importantly the
food<00:05:13.220> in<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.580> form<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.820> poultry<00:05:14.180> but<00:05:14.750> also<00:05:14.930> its

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
food in the form of poultry but also its

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.600 
food in the form of poultry but also its
feathers<00:05:15.470> which<00:05:15.710> are<00:05:15.830> useful<00:05:15.980> for<00:05:16.160> crafting

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
feathers which are useful for crafting

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.850

make<00:05:19.010> some<00:05:19.160> more<00:05:19.250> bricks<00:05:19.580> because<00:05:20.180> he's

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
make some more bricks because he's

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.090 
make some more bricks because he's
standing<00:05:20.840> there<00:05:20.900> vacantly<00:05:21.470> staring<00:05:21.830> into<00:05:22.010> the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
standing there vacantly staring into the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.810 
standing there vacantly staring into the
furnace<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:24.470> here<00:05:24.740> we<00:05:24.830> go<00:05:25.010> three<00:05:25.310> food<00:05:25.580> and

that's about all I have to show for this

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.270 
that's about all I have to show for this
video<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.440> I'd<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.800> remind<00:05:30.980> you<00:05:31.160> all

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
that this is but a very very small

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.170 
that this is but a very very small
glimpse<00:05:33.680> of<00:05:33.920> what<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.460> can<00:05:34.610> do<00:05:34.730> in<00:05:34.820> timber<00:05:35.090> and

stone in its current state which and of
itself<00:05:37.490> is<00:05:37.760> not<00:05:38.240> much<00:05:38.660> compared<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.080> what<00:05:39.140> I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260
