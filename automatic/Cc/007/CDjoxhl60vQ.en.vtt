00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.620
 You decided today to do something different than 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.630
 instead of a photo 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.759
 I'm here talking to you a video 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 all these months 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.350
 We 've always been in touch. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.750
 of love speaks of flowers and plants 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.840
 dividing by adding messages I learned 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.330
 with you, we have reached 100 thousand 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.060
 As I said on another occasion, you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.559
 it's not just a universe like that there is always 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 people that like this page do not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.379
 canon and has its importance as we 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.390
 We really like to plant and also 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 we know that whoever plants crops is not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 even as the old saying goes 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 I'm going to give you a tip that I 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.620
 I want it to be marked there in your 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.719
 heart beyond the words that people 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 entered all this time something that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.039
 You'll do this to me, too. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 when my children were still 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 very small and by the squares of the city 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.010
 through the city parks we plant 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.799
 some avocado trees I know I can live 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 in an apartment and want a plant 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.159
 doing is a silly thing a lot 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.890
 you can have it run and in the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.479
 your home and then you search for a way 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 the city and society where you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.979
 can plant this potato and it will sprout 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.770
 inside your home and will become a 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.259
 tree and beautiful is also a way of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.259
 people teach their children from the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.970
 cultivate to preserve the green then today 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.460
 We are going to sing a model of a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.479
 different form and then when it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040
