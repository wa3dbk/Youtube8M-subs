00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay let's put a roll bar in this thing

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay let's put a roll bar in this thing
so<00:00:03.710> this<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.950> be<00:00:05.069> inventor<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.490> Trish<00:00:05.700> picked

up is called an affordable bender it

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.120 
up is called an affordable bender it
came<00:00:08.730> off<00:00:08.849> eBay<00:00:09.300> it's<00:00:09.960> not<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> terrible<00:00:10.740> vendor

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
came off eBay it's not a terrible vendor

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.030 
came off eBay it's not a terrible vendor
but<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> had<00:00:11.880> some<00:00:12.059> problems<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.719> see<00:00:13.040> we're

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
but I had some problems as you see we're

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.919 
but I had some problems as you see we're
having<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.490> heck<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.150> time<00:00:15.360> trying<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.809> get

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
having a heck of a time trying to get

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.250 
having a heck of a time trying to get
the<00:00:16.109> pipe<00:00:16.320> loaded<00:00:16.940> it<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.119> doesn't<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the pipe loaded it just doesn't that the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
the pipe loaded it just doesn't that the
tolerances<00:00:19.830> were<00:00:19.980> kind<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.250> bad<00:00:20.570> eventually

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
tolerances were kind of bad eventually

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.019 
tolerances were kind of bad eventually
we<00:00:21.720> learned<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.740> needed<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> put<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> clamp

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
we learned that we needed to put a clamp

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
we learned that we needed to put a clamp
on<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.269> also<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> dye<00:00:26.039> doesn't<00:00:26.310> move

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
on it also so the dye doesn't move

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.439 
on it also so the dye doesn't move
around<00:00:28.010> here<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.279> struggling<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.210> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
around here I'm struggling with it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.389 
around here I'm struggling with it
alright<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.199> here's<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> first<00:00:31.650> Bend<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
alright so here's the first Bend this is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.310 
alright so here's the first Bend this is
going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:35.059> doorpost<00:00:36.079> that's<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
going to be the doorpost that's going to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
going to be the doorpost that's going to
be<00:00:37.380> behind<00:00:37.530> Trish<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> banging<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
be behind Trish kind of banging on it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.590 
be behind Trish kind of banging on it
they're<00:00:39.840> trying<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:41.120> in<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.300> plane

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
they're trying to get it in a in a plane

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.470 
they're trying to get it in a in a plane
so<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:45.960> straight<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.800> bent

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
so it's so it's straight when it's bent

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
so it's so it's straight when it's bent
so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.600> been<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.160> Trish's<00:00:50.160> petering<00:00:50.579> out

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so it's been that Trish's petering out

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.959 
so it's been that Trish's petering out
on<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.250> top<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:53.850> going

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
on there that is the the top we're going

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.770 
on there that is the the top we're going
to<00:00:54.090> cross<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> roll<00:00:55.199> bar<00:00:56.780> using

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
to cross the top of the roll bar using

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.130 
to cross the top of the roll bar using
some<00:00:57.960> levels<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:58.739> sure<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.219> the<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
some levels to make sure that the the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
some levels to make sure that the the
tubing<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> ninety<00:01:02.070> degrees

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
tubing is ninety degrees

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.590 
tubing is ninety degrees
there<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.449> struggling<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
there you go I'm struggling with the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700 
there you go I'm struggling with the
tubing<00:01:06.600> vendor<00:01:06.930> again<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:10.020> tried<00:01:10.260> oil<00:01:10.500> we

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
tubing vendor again we tried oil we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
tubing vendor again we tried oil we
tried<00:01:10.920> everything<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.880> finally

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
tried everything there we go finally

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.550 
tried everything there we go finally
figured<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.570> using<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.110> clamp<00:01:13.380> works<00:01:15.560> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
figured out using a clamp works they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
figured out using a clamp works they
should<00:01:16.710> put<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> pin<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:19.400> alright<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
should put a pin in it alright so this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.730 
should put a pin in it alright so this
is<00:01:21.990> oh<00:01:23.720> oh<00:01:24.720> yeah<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:24.990> getting<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.350> ticked<00:01:25.619> off

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is oh oh yeah I'm getting so ticked off

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.990 
is oh oh yeah I'm getting so ticked off
and<00:01:26.070> putting<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.610> drill<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.640> Reed<00:01:29.640> drilling

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and putting a drill and Reed drilling

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.649 
and putting a drill and Reed drilling
things<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:31.640> irie<00:01:32.640> drilled<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> aluminum

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
things out irie drilled out the aluminum

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.149 
things out irie drilled out the aluminum
die<00:01:34.070> finally<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.840> think<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.560> now

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.050 

fight<00:01:40.909> fight<00:01:41.390> fight<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:43.460> we're<00:01:43.549> going<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.729> do<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
fight fight fight so we're going to do a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.020 
fight fight fight so we're going to do a
slight<00:01:44.479> offset<00:01:45.070> so<00:01:46.070> instead<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.549> going<00:01:46.789> to<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
slight offset so instead of going to the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.870 
slight offset so instead of going to the
perimeter<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.979> chassis<00:01:49.430> we're<00:01:49.759> going

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
perimeter of the the chassis we're going

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.080 
perimeter of the the chassis we're going
to<00:01:49.939> go<00:01:50.210> straight<00:01:50.630> down<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.289> subframe

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
to go straight down to the subframe

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.319 
to go straight down to the subframe
connector<00:01:54.579> it's<00:01:55.579> going<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.880> save<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> little

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
connector it's going to save a little

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.960 
connector it's going to save a little
bit<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.630> right-side<00:01:57.229> weight<00:01:57.729> we<00:01:58.729> could<00:01:58.880> have

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
bit of right-side weight we could have

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.830 
bit of right-side weight we could have
done<00:01:59.060> an<00:01:59.240> extreme<00:01:59.780> offset<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.539> added<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.600> third

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
done an extreme offset and added a third

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.230 
done an extreme offset and added a third
Bend<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:03.319> it's<00:02:03.439> not<00:02:03.590> really<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:05.030> car<00:02:05.210> that

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
Bend but it's not really in a car that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.969 
Bend but it's not really in a car that
has<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.600> weigh<00:02:05.720> 3,500<00:02:06.409> pounds<00:02:06.679> it's<00:02:06.829> not

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
has to weigh 3,500 pounds it's not

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.970 
has to weigh 3,500 pounds it's not
really<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.250> big<00:02:07.429> deal<00:02:10.840> trim<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.959> down<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.140> size<00:02:12.470> I

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
really a big deal trim it down to size I

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.020 
really a big deal trim it down to size I
get<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.209> height<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.970> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
get the right height there it is it's a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:31.790 
get the right height there it is it's a
good<00:02:20.180> view<00:02:20.450> showing<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.049> offset

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.500 

I<00:02:32.270> just<00:02:33.270> run<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> camera<00:02:35.270> here<00:02:36.270> we<00:02:36.300> go

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I just run into the camera here we go

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.490 
I just run into the camera here we go
there's<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.080> subframe<00:02:37.590> connectors<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
there's the subframe connectors and the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.650 
there's the subframe connectors and the
support<00:02:40.860> keeps<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.280> equipped<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:42.510> there

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
support keeps it equipped on there

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.230 
support keeps it equipped on there
before<00:02:42.960> now<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.260> angling<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.640> bottom<00:02:45.090> of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
before now I'm angling the bottom of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.060 
before now I'm angling the bottom of
these<00:02:45.420> tubes<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.930> seat<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.620> Trish<00:02:49.860> got

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
these tubes so the seat that Trish got

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.290 
these tubes so the seat that Trish got
is<00:02:50.700> an<00:02:50.850> aluminum<00:02:52.340> seat<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.550> about<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.060> think

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
is an aluminum seat with about I think

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.910 
is an aluminum seat with about I think
it's<00:02:54.480> probably<00:02:54.690> about<00:02:54.840> 10<00:02:55.320> degrees<00:02:55.880> tip<00:02:56.880> back

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
it's probably about 10 degrees tip back

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.960 
it's probably about 10 degrees tip back
so<00:02:58.920> we're<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.190> angle<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.610> roll<00:02:59.790> bar

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
so we're going to angle the roll bar

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.190 
so we're going to angle the roll bar
back<00:03:03.680> more<00:03:04.680> or<00:03:04.740> less<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.010> match<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.720> angle<00:03:06.720> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
back more or less to match the angle of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.880 
back more or less to match the angle of
the<00:03:07.440> window<00:03:08.010> posts<00:03:08.430> anyway<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.390> car

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
the window posts anyway and the car

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.050 
the window posts anyway and the car
you're<00:03:10.890> how<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> get<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.280> giant<00:03:11.550> crescent

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
you're how to get the giant crescent

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.930 
you're how to get the giant crescent
wrench<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.630> try<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.520> tweak<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.880> to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
wrench out to try to tweak this in to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.940 
wrench out to try to tweak this in to
place<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.450> quiet<00:03:15.780> get<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.230> right

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.809 

it's<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.129> be<00:03:24.189> more<00:03:24.340> bars<00:03:24.579> in<00:03:24.790> here

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
it's going to be more bars in here

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.119 
it's going to be more bars in here
bracing<00:03:25.360> this<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.140> stitch<00:03:26.439> that<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.860> to

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
bracing this I have to stitch that in to

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.110 
bracing this I have to stitch that in to
where<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> leaf<00:03:28.299> springs<00:03:28.689> Nick<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.700> get<00:03:30.939> some

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
where the leaf springs Nick and get some

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.380 
where the leaf springs Nick and get some
rest<00:03:31.420> off<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:32.400> rained<00:03:33.400> bunch<00:03:33.760> since<00:03:34.090> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
rest off of there rained bunch since the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.110 
rest off of there rained bunch since the
last<00:03:34.540> time<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:34.900> worked<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:35.290> it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.690 

now<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.930> started<00:03:42.200> raining<00:03:42.349> again<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.580> is

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
now it started raining again so this is

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.040 
now it started raining again so this is
going<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.879> be<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> brace<00:03:44.269> out<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.690> front<00:03:44.930> of

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
going to be a brace out to the front of

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.970 
going to be a brace out to the front of
the<00:03:45.260> subframe<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.050> about<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.500> 45

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
the subframe so you like about a 45

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.770 
the subframe so you like about a 45
degree<00:03:49.099> Bend<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:53.260> try<00:03:54.260> into<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:56.599> roll

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
degree Bend and then try into the roll

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.400 
degree Bend and then try into the roll
bar<00:03:56.959> in<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.410> back<00:03:58.390> cut<00:03:59.390> through<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:02.410> firewall

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
bar in the back cut through the firewall

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.369 
bar in the back cut through the firewall
there<00:04:04.420> I'm<00:04:05.420> concerned<00:04:05.810> about<00:04:05.870> putting<00:04:06.140> this

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
there I'm concerned about putting this

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.170 
there I'm concerned about putting this
one<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.739> right<00:04:06.920> away<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.549> roll<00:04:08.000> bar

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
one in right away so that roll bar

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.940 
one in right away so that roll bar
doesn't<00:04:08.510> move<00:04:08.629> back<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.019> forth<00:04:09.260> as<00:04:09.470> we<00:04:09.620> start

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
doesn't move back and forth as we start

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:20.470 
doesn't move back and forth as we start
building<00:04:10.099> other<00:04:10.430> parts<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:10.940> car

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.770 

that's<00:04:21.080> fighting<00:04:21.470> with<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> tubing<00:04:22.010> vendor<00:04:22.280> I

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that's fighting with the tubing vendor I

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.090 
that's fighting with the tubing vendor I
think<00:04:23.780> she<00:04:23.900> only<00:04:23.990> paid<00:04:24.200> three<00:04:24.530> hundred<00:04:24.560> four

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
think she only paid three hundred four

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.160 
think she only paid three hundred four
hundred<00:04:25.130> dollars<00:04:25.550> for<00:04:25.730> this<00:04:25.850> thing<00:04:26.170> really

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
hundred dollars for this thing really

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.890 
hundred dollars for this thing really
good<00:04:27.410> value<00:04:27.860> honestly<00:04:31.420> I'm<00:04:32.420> using<00:04:32.630> a<00:04:32.720> piece<00:04:32.870> of

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
good value honestly I'm using a piece of

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.100 
good value honestly I'm using a piece of
wire<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:35.480> estimate<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.080> bend<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:38.110> don't

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
wire to to estimate the bend I don't

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.200 
wire to to estimate the bend I don't
think<00:04:39.320> she<00:04:39.470> stopped<00:04:39.710> before<00:04:39.860> right<00:04:40.730> when<00:04:41.120> I

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
think she stopped before right when I

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.580 
think she stopped before right when I
had<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.420> tube<00:04:41.600> through<00:04:41.840> there<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.020> bent<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
had the tube through there I bent the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.510 
had the tube through there I bent the
piece<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:43.730> welding<00:04:44.060> rod<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.630> wire<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:45.590> the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
piece of welding rod the wire to the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.760 
piece of welding rod the wire to the
contour<00:04:46.970> line<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:50.000> just<00:04:50.690> fish<00:04:50.960> mouth<00:04:51.170> it<00:04:51.440> here

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
contour line and just fish mouth it here

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.030 
contour line and just fish mouth it here
and<00:04:51.980> cut<00:04:52.520> up<00:04:52.640> an<00:04:53.540> angle<00:04:54.020> across<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.530> bottom<00:04:54.710> so

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
and cut up an angle across the bottom so

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.990 
and cut up an angle across the bottom so
it'll<00:04:55.190> tie<00:04:55.430> into<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:57.100> subframe<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.790> fish

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
it'll tie into the subframe the fish

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.670 
it'll tie into the subframe the fish
mouth<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.750> back<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.290> then<00:05:00.410> cut<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.250> front

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.060 

unfortunately<00:05:07.639> my<00:05:07.790> tubing<00:05:08.180> notcher<00:05:08.570> broke<00:05:09.070> so

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
unfortunately my tubing notcher broke so

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.230 
unfortunately my tubing notcher broke so
I<00:05:10.130> don't<00:05:10.280> know<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.580> be<00:05:10.699> not<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:10.970> have<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.150> do

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
I don't know to be not you have to do

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.840 
I don't know to be not you have to do
everything<00:05:11.540> manually<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:13.160> got<00:05:13.340> dark<00:05:13.639> and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
everything manually and it got dark and

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.090 
everything manually and it got dark and
we<00:05:14.060> kind<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.330> had<00:05:14.449> it<00:05:14.570> stopped<00:05:14.919> thanks<00:05:15.919> for

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
we kind of had it stopped thanks for

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.370 
we kind of had it stopped thanks for
watching
