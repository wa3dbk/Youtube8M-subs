00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
how much I spent if you paid upfront for

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.610 
how much I spent if you paid upfront for
like<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> package<00:02:08.550> um<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.349> saved<00:02:10.709> money

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
like a package um then you saved money

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.860 
like a package um then you saved money
and<00:02:11.800> they<00:02:12.640> say<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:12.970> people<00:02:13.300> usually<00:02:13.569> need

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870

under hair my underarm hair would take

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.059 
under hair my underarm hair would take
like<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> couple<00:03:10.180> days<00:03:10.480> grow<00:03:10.840> back<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.319> then<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
like a couple days grow back and then it

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.120 
like a couple days grow back and then it
would<00:03:12.190> grow<00:03:12.459> back<00:03:12.640> in<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:14.650> would<00:03:14.799> take<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:14.980> lot

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
would grow back in it would take a lot

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.380 
would grow back in it would take a lot
it<00:03:15.250> would<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.489> basically<00:03:15.579> take<00:03:16.000> longer<00:03:16.209> to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
it would just basically take longer to

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.449 
it would just basically take longer to
grow<00:03:16.510> back<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.410> she<00:03:17.500> said<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:17.980> was<00:03:18.100> normal

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
grow back in so she said that was normal

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.039 
grow back in so she said that was normal
and<00:03:18.670> after<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> couple<00:03:19.090> sessions<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:19.870> it

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
and after a couple sessions like it

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.050 
and after a couple sessions like it
would<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.200> stop<00:03:20.500> coming<00:03:20.829> back<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.130> or<00:03:21.430> if<00:03:21.970> it

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
would just stop coming back in or if it

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.640 
would just stop coming back in or if it
did<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.299> would<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.420> like<00:03:22.630> light<00:03:22.930> vellus<00:03:23.440> hair

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
did it would be like light vellus hair

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.870 
did it would be like light vellus hair
which<00:03:23.920> like<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.190> wouldn't<00:03:24.519> really<00:03:24.609> have<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
which like you wouldn't really have to

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.920 
which like you wouldn't really have to
shave<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.120> fourth<00:03:28.359> session<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.870> was

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
shave so I like the fourth session I was

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.960 
shave so I like the fourth session I was
like<00:03:29.049> listen<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.530> all<00:03:29.739> my<00:03:30.250> underarm<00:03:30.700> hair<00:03:30.850> is

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
like listen like all my underarm hair is

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.490 
like listen like all my underarm hair is
still<00:03:31.180> there<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.620> um<00:03:33.390> it's<00:03:34.390> not<00:03:34.569> making<00:03:35.319> a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
still there and um it's not making a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.599 
still there and um it's not making a
difference<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.069> takes<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.370> couple<00:03:36.489> days

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
difference like it takes a couple days

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.520 
difference like it takes a couple days
to<00:03:36.760> grow<00:03:36.970> back<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.209> otherwise<00:03:37.840> it's<00:03:38.170> still

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
to grow back but otherwise it's still

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.620 
to grow back but otherwise it's still
all<00:03:38.709> there<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.489> she<00:03:39.579> basically<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:40.299> cranked

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
all there so she basically like cranked

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.500 
all there so she basically like cranked
up<00:03:40.690> machine<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.440> two<00:03:41.680> passes<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:43.269> past

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
up machine to two passes and the past

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.270

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
and it worked I don't know what it was

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.770 
and it worked I don't know what it was
but<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.790> some<00:04:06.940> reason<00:04:07.239> laser<00:04:07.420> hair<00:04:07.630> removal

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
but for some reason laser hair removal

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.319 
but for some reason laser hair removal
didn't<00:04:08.260> work<00:04:08.380> for<00:04:08.410> me<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.859> it<00:04:09.489> was<00:04:09.609> so<00:04:09.940> painful

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
didn't work for me and it was so painful

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.740 
didn't work for me and it was so painful
and<00:04:11.340> even<00:04:12.340> even<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.060> pain<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.329> went<00:04:13.450> through<00:04:13.660> it

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
and even even the pain I went through it

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.420 
and even even the pain I went through it
like<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.019> almost<00:04:14.350> wasn't<00:04:14.680> worth<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.130> but<00:04:15.190> I'd

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
like it almost wasn't worth it but I'd

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.190 
like it almost wasn't worth it but I'd
already<00:04:15.670> paid<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.630> kept<00:04:16.840> going<00:04:17.079> back

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
already paid for it so I kept going back

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.219 
already paid for it so I kept going back
anyway<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.450> didn't<00:04:19.690> pay<00:04:19.780> for<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.169> would

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
anyway if I didn't pay for it I would

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.230 
anyway if I didn't pay for it I would
have<00:04:20.440> gone<00:04:20.590> back<00:04:20.830> because<00:04:21.159> to<00:04:21.549> me<00:04:21.700> shaving<00:04:22.150> my

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
have gone back because to me shaving my

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.600 
have gone back because to me shaving my
underarms

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
underarms

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.070 
underarms
is<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.850> lot<00:04:24.240> less<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.600> burden<00:04:24.750> than

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
is a lot less of a burden than

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.270 
is a lot less of a burden than
everything<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.470> went<00:04:25.650> through<00:04:25.800> for<00:04:26.009> laser<00:04:26.190> hair

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
everything I went through for laser hair

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.900 
everything I went through for laser hair
removal<00:04:27.199> so<00:04:28.199> all<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:29.039> all<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.430> wouldn't

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
removal so all in all I wouldn't

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.760 
removal so all in all I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.720> anyone<00:04:31.020> especially

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
recommend it to anyone especially

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230 
recommend it to anyone especially
because<00:04:32.100> there<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> chance<00:04:32.759> that<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.090> won't

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
because there is a chance that it won't

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.909 
because there is a chance that it won't
work<00:04:33.509> and<00:04:33.810> even<00:04:33.930> after<00:04:34.229> six<00:04:34.440> sessions<00:04:34.620> it

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
work and even after six sessions it

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.650 
work and even after six sessions it
still<00:04:35.160> didn't<00:04:35.430> work<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:35.729> me<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.030> there's<00:04:36.539> no

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
still didn't work for me and there's no

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.820 
still didn't work for me and there's no
reason<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.080> shouldn't<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.620> really<00:04:38.310> um<00:04:39.830> maybe

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
pretty much it it does still grow back a

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.250 
pretty much it it does still grow back a
little<00:05:45.000> bit<00:05:45.210> slower<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:45.750> takes<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.020> little<00:05:46.169> bit

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
little bit slower it takes a little bit

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.629 
little bit slower it takes a little bit
longer<00:05:46.409> to<00:05:46.650> grow<00:05:46.830> back<00:05:46.979> like<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.370> won't<00:05:47.550> be

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
longer to grow back like I won't be

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.580 
longer to grow back like I won't be
immediately<00:05:48.419> stuck<00:05:48.720> it's<00:05:48.930> doubly<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.380> next

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
immediately stuck it's doubly the next

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.850 
immediately stuck it's doubly the next
day<00:05:49.740> will<00:05:50.400> be<00:05:50.430> but<00:05:50.789> I'll<00:05:50.880> still<00:05:51.120> be<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.720> know

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
day will be but I'll still be you know

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.680 
day will be but I'll still be you know
I'll<00:05:52.860> be<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.370> little<00:05:53.669> stubbly<00:05:53.940> but<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.419> used<00:05:54.570> to

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
I'll be a little stubbly but it used to

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.120 
I'll be a little stubbly but it used to
grow<00:05:54.810> back<00:05:55.020> at<00:05:55.229> least<00:05:55.470> a<00:05:55.620> couple<00:05:55.889> centimeters

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
grow back at least a couple centimeters

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.830 
grow back at least a couple centimeters
by<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.520> next<00:05:56.759> day<00:05:56.880> like<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.240> grows<00:05:57.449> really

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
by the next day like it grows really

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.279 
by the next day like it grows really
fast<00:05:58.259> so<00:05:59.009> um<00:05:59.280> it<00:05:59.940> just<00:06:00.240> grows<00:06:00.539> slightly<00:06:01.020> slower

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
fast so um it just grows slightly slower

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.649 
fast so um it just grows slightly slower
and<00:06:01.530> that's<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:01.860> unfortunately<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.880> don't<00:06:03.330> have

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
and that's it unfortunately I don't have

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.730 
and that's it unfortunately I don't have
my<00:06:03.949> baby<00:06:04.949> soft<00:06:05.310> smooth<00:06:06.110> armpits<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.440> I
