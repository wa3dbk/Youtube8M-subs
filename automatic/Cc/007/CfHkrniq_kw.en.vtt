00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
down you got impact right I mean I think

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
down you got impact right I mean I think
every<00:01:33.360> night<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> week<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.439> some

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
every night of the week there is some

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
every night of the week there is some
sort<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.159> wrestling<00:01:35.640> program<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.360> show<00:01:36.630> on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
during the week and it's absolutely
phenomenal<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.570> ever<00:01:40.140> since<00:01:40.259> Impact

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
phenomenal and I think ever since Impact

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
phenomenal and I think ever since Impact
Wrestling<00:01:40.829> moved<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> friday<00:01:41.700> nights<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
Wrestling moved to friday nights and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
Wrestling moved to friday nights and
although<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.750> their<00:01:42.899> highest<00:01:43.110> rating

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
although that is their highest rating

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.280 
although that is their highest rating
program<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.159> destination<00:01:44.970> America<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.570> think

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
program on destination America I think

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
program on destination America I think
the<00:01:46.619> fact<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> report<00:01:47.939> came
