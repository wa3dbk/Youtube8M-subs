the only thing that I really like notice

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.800 
the only thing that I really like notice
is<00:01:09.439> down<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> bottom<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is down here at the bottom it's kind of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.859 
is down here at the bottom it's kind of
frizzy<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.729> good<00:01:15.090> until<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> gets<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
frizzy like it's good until it gets to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.590 
frizzy like it's good until it gets to
this<00:01:15.960> part<00:01:16.259> down<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:17.159> gets<00:01:17.250> frizzy<00:01:17.600> but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this part down here it gets frizzy but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
this part down here it gets frizzy but
um<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.740> mean<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.729> big<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
um I mean it's not really that big of a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.859 
um I mean it's not really that big of a
deal<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.659> me<00:01:21.780> no<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.610> really<00:01:23.610> noticed<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.479> think

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
deal to me no one really noticed I think

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
deal to me no one really noticed I think
people<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.350> infatuated<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:27.060> color

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
people are so infatuated with the color

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.990 
people are so infatuated with the color
of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.110> hair<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> ombre<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.460> they

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
of the hair like the ombre that they

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
of the hair like the ombre that they
really<00:01:30.450> aren't<00:01:30.750> looking<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> frizz<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
really aren't looking at the frizz and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
really aren't looking at the frizz and
I've<00:01:32.850> been<00:01:33.000> getting<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> lot<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.420> compliments

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I've been getting a lot of compliments

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.789 
I've been getting a lot of compliments
on<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.110> hair<00:01:36.049> basically<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.439> my<00:01:37.590> first

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
on my hair basically in my first

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.920 
on my hair basically in my first
impression<00:01:38.189> video<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:38.939> talked<00:01:39.509> about<00:01:39.630> how

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
impression video I just talked about how

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.859 
impression video I just talked about how
the<00:01:40.740> texture<00:01:41.130> changed<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> bottom<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.810> my

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the texture changed at the bottom of my

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.620 
the texture changed at the bottom of my
hair<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:44.340> smoother<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> top<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.540> then

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
hair it's smoother at the top and then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.280 
hair it's smoother at the top and then
it<00:01:45.750> goes<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:48.950> coarser<00:01:49.950> texture<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.290> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it goes down to a coarser texture and I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.380 
it goes down to a coarser texture and I
guess<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.790> row<00:01:53.939> hair<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
guess it's just like your row hair the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.749 
guess it's just like your row hair the
more<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.659> bleach<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:55.829> coarse<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
more you bleach it the more coarse it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.450 
more you bleach it the more coarse it
gets<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.829> same<00:01:59.040> thing<00:01:59.250> with

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
gets so that's kind of same thing with

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.510 
gets so that's kind of same thing with
this<00:01:59.579> hair<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.140> did<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:01.950> mention<00:02:02.189> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this hair and I did not mention in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.030 
this hair and I did not mention in
Memphis

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040

this<00:02:03.310> video<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:04.720> came<00:02:05.710> with<00:02:05.980> this<00:02:06.160> sparkly

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
this video that came with this sparkly

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.150 
this video that came with this sparkly
thing<00:02:07.180> I'm<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:07.720> exactly<00:02:08.050> sure<00:02:08.229> what<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:08.890> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
thing I'm not exactly sure what this is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.880 
thing I'm not exactly sure what this is
I'm<00:02:09.430> guessing<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.970> could<00:02:10.260> bring<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.440> up<00:02:11.680> in

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
I'm guessing you could bring it up in

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.520 
I'm guessing you could bring it up in

like<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.060> said<00:02:28.380> order<00:02:29.380> 2<00:02:29.680> 7<00:02:29.980> had<00:02:30.160> two<00:02:30.280> separate

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
like I said order 2 7 had two separate

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.960 
like I said order 2 7 had two separate
orders<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.330> my<00:02:32.080> first<00:02:32.320> order<00:02:32.620> came<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.490> about

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
orders and my first order came in about

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.390 
orders and my first order came in about
a<00:02:34.030> week<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:35.110> second<00:02:35.560> time<00:02:35.709> about<00:02:35.890> ordered

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
a week the second time about ordered

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.170 
a week the second time about ordered
which<00:02:36.790> was<00:02:37.090> more<00:02:37.660> hair<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:39.010> took<00:02:39.400> about<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:40.150> week

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
which was more hair it took about a week

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.690 
which was more hair it took about a week
and<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.480> half<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.080> did<00:02:41.200> take<00:02:41.230> longer<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.520> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and a half so it did take longer but it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.180 
and a half so it did take longer but it
didn't<00:02:42.850> take<00:02:42.970> much<00:02:43.330> longer<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:45.010> still

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
didn't take much longer but I was still

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.080 
didn't take much longer but I was still
expecting<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.850> come<00:02:46.000> faster<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.940> guess<00:02:48.940> if

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
expecting to come faster so I guess if

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.760 
expecting to come faster so I guess if
you<00:02:49.180> order<00:02:49.480> more<00:02:49.660> hair<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.020> takes<00:02:50.230> longer<00:02:50.470> for

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
you order more hair it takes longer for

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.590 
you order more hair it takes longer for
them<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:51.790> together<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.270> really
