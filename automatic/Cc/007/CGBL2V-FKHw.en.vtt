reasoning for that is to make use of his

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950 
reasoning for that is to make use of his

Tryndamere<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.940> definitely<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:51.930> stuff

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
Tryndamere can definitely do more stuff

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
Tryndamere can definitely do more stuff
than<00:00:52.260> fiora<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.640> snowball<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> lot

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
than fiora in a game and snowball a lot

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
than fiora in a game and snowball a lot

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
faster from the jungle fiora has

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.610 
faster from the jungle fiora has
consistency<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.570> Tryndamere<00:00:58.050> still<00:00:58.350> kind

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620

of liked play Russian roulette like he
when<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> jungle<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> mirror<00:01:03.629> you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
when you jungle sure in the mirror you

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
when you jungle sure in the mirror you
have<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.830> juggle<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.250> lower<00:01:05.460> health<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.030> make

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
have to juggle with lower health to make

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.149 
have to juggle with lower health to make
use<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> his<00:01:06.689> steroids<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> stuff<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.100> that

so<00:01:08.670> you're<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:09.000> juggling<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> lot

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
so you're pretty much juggling a lot

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.140 
so you're pretty much juggling a lot
like<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:11.100> state<00:01:11.610> unsafe

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
like you know at a little state unsafe

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.410 
like you know at a little state unsafe
amount<00:01:12.510> yes<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.700> head<00:01:14.939> cue<00:01:15.240> for

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
amount yes you can use your head cue for

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
amount yes you can use your head cue for
sustained<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> hurts<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.740> clearing

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
sustained but that hurts you're clearing

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
sustained but that hurts you're clearing
speed<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.110> negative

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
speed so in a way he has negative

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
speed so in a way he has negative
sustained<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.750> drain<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.470> for

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
sustained because if you drain it for

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
sustained because if you drain it for
health<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.460> slower<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.390> hit

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

are<00:02:21.390> terrible<00:02:22.170> dead<00:02:22.710> that's<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.460> that's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
are terrible dead that's just not that's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.400 
are terrible dead that's just not that's
not<00:02:23.730> even<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.090> for<00:02:24.120> debate<00:02:24.330> yeah<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> as<00:02:25.140> slow<00:02:25.380> as

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
not even up for debate yeah I as slow as

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
not even up for debate yeah I as slow as
good<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.160> damage<00:02:26.550> reduction<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.360> be

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
good and the damage reduction can be

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.210 
good and the damage reduction can be
good<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.930> he's<00:02:28.200> got<00:02:28.320> problems<00:02:28.590> chasing

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
good but he's got problems chasing

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.070 
good but he's got problems chasing
because<00:02:29.490> his<00:02:29.640> e<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.210> not<00:02:30.630> exactly<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
because his e is not exactly the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
because his e is not exactly the
greatest<00:02:31.140> thing<00:02:31.470> ever<00:02:31.620> when<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.520> just<00:02:32.730> use<00:02:32.940> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
greatest thing ever when you just use it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.540 
greatest thing ever when you just use it

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
I live by itself you know it's it's a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.880 
I live by itself you know it's it's a
basic<00:02:35.970> gap<00:02:36.180> closer<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.750> no<00:02:36.900> CC<00:02:37.230> attached<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
basic gap closer with no CC attached and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.250 
basic gap closer with no CC attached and
it's<00:02:38.250> kind<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.580> slow<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.600> actually<00:02:39.720> kind<00:02:39.930> of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it's kind of slow it's actually kind of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410

very slow and the ranges and as great as

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.940 
very slow and the ranges and as great as
you'd<00:02:42.540> want<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.440> yes<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.680> can
