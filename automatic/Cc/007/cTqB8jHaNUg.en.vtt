playing Grand Theft Auto online with the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.050 
playing Grand Theft Auto online with the
heist<00:00:22.500> update<00:00:22.890> already<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> then<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
heist update already and then I just

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.580 
heist update already and then I just
logged<00:00:24.269> off<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.930> wasn't<00:00:25.109> able<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> get
