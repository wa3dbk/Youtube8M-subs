 martial combat sports and the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.750
 a physical training 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.070
 this is the third episode in my series 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.630
 on the movements in boxing 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.980

 you will find them on my website 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 today you will see the fight in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 boxing the compass is a very moving 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 defensively important he's going to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.439
 allow not to stay in front of so much 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.599
 the opponent and therefore take less 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.949
 exactly how do you do 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.009
 imagine that tajan now this is the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 tip and barrier agents the pencil 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.500
 you are going to draw with money married 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 a quarter circle like this for 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.280
 to train you to master it you can in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.140
 do as much as mistakes to not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 commit too much weight on the bank and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 nadja maillard who get up so 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.660
 excessive like this other mistake 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.090
 frequent the foot of support am not the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
 rotation and you finish in this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.469
 position it's one position at a time 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.930
 weak and dangerous when your knee 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.119
 so really to avoid so it's very 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.860
 important to initiate the rotation on the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.860
 bowl of the foot accompanied by a good cladding 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.549
 every time you have to arrive in your 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 fighting position to be able to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.020
 hit dodge or move to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 again once you master the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.439
 basic compass there are several educational 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.600
 what can you do to place it in 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.369
 fight in episode 2 on the square on 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 saw the going back and forth we will be able to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.689
 also use it in the group to by 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.820
 example you can do three go 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 returns and behavior right away 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.340
 so I'm going back and forth 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.570
 and on the third 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 my fight one two three fights and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.909
 repeat 2 3 3 you can also do 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.860
 a heck on the first two go 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:57.390
 back and a hook on the third 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:01.470
 with the company 2 3 shows a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:08.700
 2 3 ok if I can start again ferrand 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:10.229
 circle loop 1 2 3 1 3 sat for 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.940
 use it for example in combat if you 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.550
 have done one job and the other is going 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.820
 treatment speaks jacques cros tu blocks 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.250
 his job and when the cross comes you go out 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.170
 in combat and you make me although 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.180
 sweat hook it works well when 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.160
 the other really is committed to you if 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.420
 jacques ends roth meaning to go to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.709
 before it's going to be harder but if 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.510
 and often people who fall slightly 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.880
 on their butts and that's when 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.269
 where you you withdraw it helps you to you 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.800
