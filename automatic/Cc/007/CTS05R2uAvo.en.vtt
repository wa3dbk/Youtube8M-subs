00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
is the chip bug that I used and I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.349 
is the chip bug that I used and I
cut<00:02:13.140> each<00:02:13.290> piece<00:02:13.349> out<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.129> then<00:02:14.790> assemble<00:02:15.269> it

I could have bought this in a kit just
when<00:02:25.079> it's<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.349> just<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> chipboard<00:02:25.920> cut<00:02:26.430> out

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
when it's on just the chipboard cut out

when it's on just the chipboard cut out
of<00:02:26.909> pieces<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.569> would<00:02:27.840> need<00:02:28.079> with

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
and I did two of those birdhouses

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.780 
and I did two of those birdhouses
I<00:02:36.840> don't<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:37.859> them<00:02:37.980> any<00:02:38.129> longer<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.549> show<00:02:38.730> you

is<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.139> lot<00:05:23.319> easier<00:05:23.710> than<00:05:23.919> having<00:05:24.009> to<00:05:24.190> cut<00:05:24.460> it

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
is a lot easier than having to cut it

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.779 
is a lot easier than having to cut it
all<00:05:24.759> out<00:05:25.530> some<00:05:26.530> people<00:05:26.740> don't<00:05:27.039> have<00:05:27.190> die-cuts

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
all out some people don't have die-cuts

have the right tools to do it with and

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.610
