it was quite interesting but it was as
simple<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.630> thought<00:01:45.659> alright<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.530> going

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
simple as I thought alright so I'm going

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.959 

okay<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:51.880> first<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.509> all<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.799> my<00:01:54.520> scarf

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
okay so first of all I have my scarf

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.179 
okay so first of all I have my scarf
which<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.719> a<00:01:55.899> red<00:01:56.409> one<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.649> guess<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.009> can<00:01:57.159> use

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
which is a red one I guess you can use

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.550 
which is a red one I guess you can use
whatever<00:01:57.670> color<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.240> want<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:59.229> really

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
whatever color you want but it's really

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.740 
whatever color you want but it's really
really<00:02:00.310> long<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.850> would<00:02:01.180> say<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:01.539> is<00:02:01.720> probably

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
really long I would say this is probably

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.510 
really long I would say this is probably
about<00:02:03.479> two<00:02:04.479> yards<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:05.229> fabric<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:06.159> basically

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
about two yards of fabric but basically

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.759 
about two yards of fabric but basically
if<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:06.909> have<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.119> long<00:02:07.539> behind<00:02:07.990> scarf<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.619> you

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
if you have a long behind scarf that you

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.250 
if you have a long behind scarf that you
can<00:02:08.920> kind<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.220> double<00:02:09.640> like<00:02:10.509> meaning<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.050> you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
can kind of double like meaning that you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.860 
can kind of double like meaning that you
can<00:02:11.470> wrap<00:02:12.099> it<00:02:12.130> around<00:02:12.370> your<00:02:13.300> neck

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
can wrap it around your neck

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.839 
can wrap it around your neck
twice<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.190> still<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> lot<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.849> it's

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
twice and still have a lot like so it's

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.589 
twice and still have a lot like so it's
enough

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
enough

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.979 
enough
the<00:02:19.870> bigger<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.260> fabric<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.750> better<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.959> is

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
the bigger the fabric the better it is

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.440 
the bigger the fabric the better it is
the<00:02:23.349> more<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.040> fabric<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.819> because<00:02:25.239> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
the more the fabric so because the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.039 
the more the fabric so because the
fabric<00:02:25.810> also<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.500> long<00:02:27.280> excuse<00:02:28.180> me<00:02:28.360> wide<00:02:28.630> is

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
fabric also is long excuse me wide is

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.580 
fabric also is long excuse me wide is
long<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:30.010> wide<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:31.299> is<00:02:31.450> how<00:02:31.540> wide<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.049> okay

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
long in wide this is how wide it is okay

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.680 
long in wide this is how wide it is okay
so<00:02:32.680> what<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.010> did<00:02:33.099> was<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.459> folded<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> scarf<00:02:34.480> in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
so what I did was I folded the scarf in

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.979 
so what I did was I folded the scarf in
half<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:40.650> fold<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.799> in<00:02:41.890> half<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.400> long

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
half like so I fold it in half the long

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.930 
half like so I fold it in half the long
way<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.650> folded<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.280> half<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.700> long<00:02:45.730> way

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940

is folded as you can see this is the

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.780 
is folded as you can see this is the
part<00:03:10.690> where<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.470> put<00:03:12.090> over<00:03:14.069> my<00:03:15.069> head<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
part where I put over my head now the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.210 
part where I put over my head now the
ends<00:03:16.389> do<00:03:16.600> not<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.109> be<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.470> equal<00:03:17.739> length

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
ends do not have to be of equal length

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.240 
ends do not have to be of equal length
it's<00:03:18.519> not<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:19.090> big<00:03:19.720> deal<00:03:19.989> they<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.590> one

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
it's not a big deal they can be one

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.370 
it's not a big deal they can be one
could<00:03:21.430> be<00:03:21.579> smaller<00:03:22.209> than<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.540> other<00:03:22.750> on<00:03:23.200> each

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
could be smaller than the other on each

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.319 
could be smaller than the other on each
side<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.950> I'm<00:03:24.400> going<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.639> make<00:03:24.819> sure<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.000> put<00:03:25.180> it

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
side so I'm going to make sure I put it

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.180 
side so I'm going to make sure I put it

stock<00:03:36.609> has<00:03:36.880> fringes<00:03:37.810> on<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.079> ends<00:03:38.560> but<00:03:39.400> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
stock has fringes on the ends but I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.309 
stock has fringes on the ends but I
don't<00:03:39.730> want<00:03:39.880> have<00:03:40.000> fringes<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.569> show<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.079> what

to do with this do it my head round is

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.660 
to do with this do it my head round is
that<00:03:51.830> I'm<00:03:52.010> going<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.400> begin<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:55.190> wrap<00:03:55.460> it

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
that I'm going to begin to wrap it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.650 
that I'm going to begin to wrap it
around<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.500> all<00:03:57.680> I'm<00:03:57.800> doing<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:59.300> going

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660
