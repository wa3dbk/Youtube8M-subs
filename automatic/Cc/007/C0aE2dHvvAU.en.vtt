00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
looking for some sort of makeshift mall

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.670 
looking for some sort of makeshift mall
our<00:01:47.030> type<00:01:47.300> thing<00:01:47.600> here<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:48.050> wanted<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.410> leave

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
our type thing here so I wanted to leave

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.800 
our type thing here so I wanted to leave
up<00:01:48.830> Abyssinian<00:01:49.430> priests<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.150> tap<00:01:50.660> it

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
up Abyssinian priests just to tap it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.000 
up Abyssinian priests just to tap it
down<00:01:51.490> if<00:01:52.490> possible<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:56.680> continue<00:01:57.680> getting<00:01:57.800> in

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
down if possible and continue getting in

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.230 
down if possible and continue getting in
there<00:01:58.190> but<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.729> probably<00:01:58.940> would<00:01:59.119> have<00:01:59.150> been

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
there but it probably would have been

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.550 
there but it probably would have been
better<00:01:59.330> just<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.750> attack<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.200> play<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.410> moon

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
better just to attack and play the moon

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.680 
better just to attack and play the moon
heron<00:02:00.890> but<00:02:01.729> since<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:02.030> left<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.330> back<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.630> think

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
heron but since I left it back I think

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.060 
heron but since I left it back I think
playing<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> Fox<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.470> going<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.710> end<00:02:03.800> up<00:02:03.860> being

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
playing the Fox is going to end up being

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.180 
playing the Fox is going to end up being
better<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.380> turns<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.860> right<00:02:09.979> kind

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
better so it turns out in the right kind

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.710 
better so it turns out in the right kind
of<00:02:10.220> deck<00:02:10.459> guys<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.000> saint<00:02:11.209> traft<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.600> like

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
really good if you even have just a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.210 
really good if you even have just a
couple<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.390> bounce<00:02:14.750> spells<00:02:15.080> or<00:02:15.260> whatnot<00:02:15.440> this

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
guy's like he's a savage beating if you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.710 
guy's like he's a savage beating if you
don't<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.880> lot<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.000> removal<00:02:20.390> though<00:02:20.510> he's

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
don't have a lot of removal though he's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.060 
don't have a lot of removal though he's
just<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.989> lot<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.200> X<00:02:21.410> which<00:02:22.100> is<00:02:22.280> no<00:02:22.489> good<00:02:26.980> look<00:02:27.980> at

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
just a lot of X which is no good look at

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.720 
just a lot of X which is no good look at
that<00:02:28.250> I'm<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:29.269> mind<00:02:29.510> reader<00:02:29.630> man

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.270 

so<00:02:33.730> hopefully<00:02:34.030> we<00:02:34.450> draw<00:02:34.660> land<00:02:35.050> here<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.209> can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so hopefully we draw land here and can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.610 
so hopefully we draw land here and can
just<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.900> also<00:02:41.230> fine<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.840> let's<00:02:44.020> see<00:02:44.200> if<00:02:44.530> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
just that's also fine so let's see if I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.560 
just that's also fine so let's see if I
tap<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.190> that's<00:02:45.550> for<00:02:47.820> for<00:02:49.950> 10-14

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
tap this down that's for for 10-14

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.600 
tap this down that's for for 10-14
almost<00:02:52.570> gets<00:02:52.780> there

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.820 

I<00:02:58.670> am<00:02:59.300> pretty<00:02:59.960> sure<00:03:00.080> we're<00:03:00.440> going<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.620> win<00:03:00.680> this

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
I am pretty sure we're going to win this

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:10.410 
I am pretty sure we're going to win this
game

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.600 

I<00:03:10.510> definitely<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.740> pass<00:03:12.069> here<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.370> don't

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
I definitely just pass here I don't

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.650 
I definitely just pass here I don't
think<00:03:12.730> there's<00:03:12.880> any<00:03:13.030> reason<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.330> play<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
think there's any reason to play the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.570 
think there's any reason to play the
moon<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.170> when<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.319> can<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.590> tap<00:03:15.250> this

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
moon here and when I can just tap this

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.520 
moon here and when I can just tap this
Tappin<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.599> their<00:03:16.720> blocker<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:17.290> almost

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
Tappin on their blocker and then almost

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:55.970 
Tappin on their blocker and then almost
certainly<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.459> lethal

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.610 

on<00:03:56.310> breathing<00:03:56.909> hoard<00:03:57.360> as<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.629> 22<00:03:58.230> where<00:03:58.500> you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
on breathing hoard as a 22 where you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.400 
on breathing hoard as a 22 where you
kiddin<00:03:59.040> me<00:03:59.220> that's<00:03:59.909> hilarious

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.140 

I<00:04:07.860> think<00:04:08.860> I'll<00:04:08.980> definitely<00:04:09.520> get<00:04:09.820> in<00:04:09.970> with<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
I think I'll definitely get in with the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.250 
I think I'll definitely get in with the
Geist<00:04:10.390> here<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:12.750> suppose<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.900> should<00:04:14.170> have

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
Geist here I suppose I should have

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.810 
Geist here I suppose I should have
played<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.590> moon<00:04:14.890> hair<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.250> last<00:04:15.460> turn<00:04:15.640> so

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
played the moon hair and last turn so

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.380 
played the moon hair and last turn so
let's<00:04:15.970> see<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.420> I<00:04:17.100> get<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.280> what<00:04:19.030> does<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.239> say

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
let's see so I get in what does it say

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.810 
let's see so I get in what does it say
if<00:04:19.630> damage<00:04:20.019> would<00:04:20.170> be<00:04:20.230> dealt<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.400> prevent

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
if damage would be dealt to it prevent

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.580 
if damage would be dealt to it prevent
that<00:04:22.000> damage<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.690> remove<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.110> many

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
that damage and remove that many

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.100 
that damage and remove that many
counters<00:04:24.040> so<00:04:24.640> he<00:04:24.760> certainly<00:04:25.060> trades<00:04:25.570> here

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
counters so he certainly trades here

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.740 
counters so he certainly trades here
blocks<00:04:26.560> here<00:04:26.830> takes<00:04:27.450> for<00:04:29.790> ya<00:04:30.790> goes<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.510> five

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
blocks here takes for ya goes to five

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.270 
blocks here takes for ya goes to five
and<00:04:31.960> then<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.140> get<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.290> play<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.530> moon<00:04:32.740> heron<00:04:33.130> and

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
and then I get to play a moon heron and

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.660 
and then I get to play a moon heron and
have<00:04:34.320> rally<00:04:35.320> depends<00:04:35.770> in<00:04:35.860> my<00:04:35.950> hand<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.430> seems

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
have rally depends in my hand that seems

00:04:36.670 --> 00:05:10.690 
have rally depends in my hand that seems
fine

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.350 

bring<00:05:11.360> legal<00:05:12.820> interesting<00:05:13.900> yep<00:05:16.180> they<00:05:17.180> said

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
bring legal interesting yep they said

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.330 
bring legal interesting yep they said
the<00:05:17.480> area<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.750> these<00:05:17.870> two<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.140> think<00:05:18.380> especially

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
the area of these two I think especially

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.440 
the area of these two I think especially
because<00:05:19.820> this<00:05:20.030> has<00:05:20.180> flashback<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:23.210> I<00:05:23.270> guess

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
because this has flashback so I guess

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.510 
because this has flashback so I guess
we're<00:05:23.630> not<00:05:23.750> in<00:05:23.930> as<00:05:24.740> great<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.040> shape<00:05:25.190> as<00:05:25.490> it

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
we're not in as great of shape as it

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.690 
we're not in as great of shape as it
would<00:05:25.730> seem<00:05:25.940> like<00:05:27.040> but<00:05:28.040> he<00:05:28.340> can't<00:05:28.580> really

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
would seem like but he can't really

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.750 
would seem like but he can't really
attack<00:05:29.150> us<00:05:29.390> very<00:05:29.600> effectively<00:05:30.080> so<00:05:30.580> that's<00:05:31.580> the

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
attack us very effectively so that's the

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.820 
attack us very effectively so that's the
good<00:05:31.790> part<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:35.320> just<00:05:36.320> want<00:05:36.440> to<00:05:36.470> see<00:05:36.620> if<00:05:36.650> he<00:05:36.770> was

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
good part I just want to see if he was

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.980 
good part I just want to see if he was
going<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.040> do<00:05:37.160> anything<00:05:37.570> I'm<00:05:38.570> just<00:05:38.840> going<00:05:38.960> to

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
going to do anything I'm just going to

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.930 
going to do anything I'm just going to
do<00:05:39.590> this<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:40.070> then<00:05:40.610> pass<00:05:40.910> the<00:05:41.090> turn<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:42.940> this

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
do this and then pass the turn and this

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.700 
do this and then pass the turn and this
way<00:05:44.240> since<00:05:44.810> he<00:05:44.930> didn't<00:05:45.170> seem<00:05:45.260> to<00:05:45.380> have<00:05:45.560> any

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
way since he didn't seem to have any

00:05:45.710 --> 00:06:03.950 
way since he didn't seem to have any
good<00:05:45.950> plays<00:05:46.550> last<00:05:46.940> turn

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.519 

yeah<00:06:04.560> we'll<00:06:05.430> just<00:06:05.660> pass<00:06:06.660> it<00:06:06.840> back<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.229> suppose

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.769 

I<00:06:11.619> think<00:06:12.369> as<00:06:12.549> soon<00:06:12.579> as<00:06:12.909> he<00:06:13.029> plays<00:06:13.239> something<00:06:13.539> we

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
I think as soon as he plays something we

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.199 
I think as soon as he plays something we
win<00:06:13.959> the<00:06:14.049> game<00:06:14.079> because<00:06:14.739> he's<00:06:14.949> dead<00:06:15.849> on<00:06:15.969> board

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.209 
win the game because he's dead on board

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:20.159 
win the game because he's dead on board
except<00:06:16.509> for<00:06:16.629> the<00:06:16.689> stitch<00:06:16.899> Drake<00:06:17.169> so<00:06:19.109> unless<00:06:20.109> he

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
except for the stitch Drake so unless he

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.259 
except for the stitch Drake so unless he
does<00:06:20.379> it<00:06:20.529> end<00:06:20.709> of<00:06:20.799> turn<00:06:20.979> I<00:06:21.009> suppose<00:06:21.489> he<00:06:21.759> could

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:22.269 
does it end of turn I suppose he could

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.989 
does it end of turn I suppose he could
like<00:06:22.949> play<00:06:23.949> some<00:06:24.189> sort<00:06:24.429> of<00:06:24.519> end<00:06:24.669> of<00:06:24.819> turn

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:24.999 
like play some sort of end of turn

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:32.819 
like play some sort of end of turn

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.550 
would have been better because he would
have<00:07:21.270> just<00:07:21.450> I<00:07:21.660> still<00:07:21.720> would<00:07:22.110> never<00:07:22.290> been<00:07:22.470> able
