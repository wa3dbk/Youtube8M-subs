00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
biggest thing that you need to know is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.320 
biggest thing that you need to know is
if<00:02:17.010> they're<00:02:17.190> gonna<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.489> using<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.849> for<00:02:17.879> hunting

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
if they're gonna be using it for hunting

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.640 
if they're gonna be using it for hunting
for<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> tactical<00:02:19.409> match<00:02:20.870> might<00:02:21.870> maybe<00:02:22.440> they

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
for a tactical match might maybe they

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.649 
for a tactical match might maybe they
even<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.099> shoot<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.400> Ventress<00:02:23.849> match<00:02:24.090> so

even want to shoot a Ventress match so
sometimes<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.409> do<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> those<00:02:27.330> are<00:02:27.510> things<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
sometimes you do so those are things you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
sometimes you do so those are things you
need<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:28.500> barrel<00:02:29.159> length<00:02:29.340> makes

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
need to know because barrel length makes

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.350 
need to know because barrel length makes
a<00:02:29.760> difference

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
a difference

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.479 
a difference
that's<00:02:30.780> all<00:02:31.080> barrel<00:02:31.560> twist<00:02:31.739> rates<00:02:32.190> make<00:02:32.459> a

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
that's all barrel twist rates make a

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.270 
that's all barrel twist rates make a
difference<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:33.959> caliber<00:02:34.739> most<00:02:34.950> people

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
difference and then caliber most people

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.800 
difference and then caliber most people
don't<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.550> what<00:02:35.730> caliber<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.360> really

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
don't know what caliber they really

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.330 
don't know what caliber they really
really<00:02:37.110> want<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.860> want<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.159> do<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
really want you know they want to do a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.339 
really want you know they want to do a
308<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.269> they're<00:02:39.450> talking<00:02:39.870> they<00:02:40.019> might<00:02:40.200> want

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
308 but they're talking they might want

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.520

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
to shoot a thousand yards plus well it's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.259 
to shoot a thousand yards plus well it's
just<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.889> enough<00:02:44.129> gas<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.760> threeway

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
talk over some of the things that we

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.540 
talk over some of the things that we
talked<00:02:57.960> about<00:02:58.110> while<00:02:58.890> building<00:02:59.160> this

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
talked about while building this

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.620 
talked about while building this
specific<00:03:00.090> rifle

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
specific rifle

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.330 
specific rifle
yeah<00:03:00.900> well<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.680> think<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:02.010> first<00:03:02.250> thing

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
yeah well the I think the first thing

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.010 
yeah well the I think the first thing
that<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.790> talked<00:03:03.060> about<00:03:03.180> was<00:03:03.630> wanting<00:03:03.960> to

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
that you talked about was wanting to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.870 
that you talked about was wanting to
have<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> tactical<00:03:04.770> talk<00:03:05.130> rifle<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
have a tactical talk rifle that you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.120 
have a tactical talk rifle that you
could<00:03:06.030> hunt<00:03:06.210> sure<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.620> tried<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.890> make

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
could hunt sure and so we tried to make

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.730 
could hunt sure and so we tried to make
it<00:03:08.160> as<00:03:08.370> lightweight<00:03:08.640> as<00:03:08.880> possible<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.470> is

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
it as lightweight as possible so this is

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.670 
it as lightweight as possible so this is
this<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> manners<00:03:11.790> T<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.240> 90%<00:03:13.050> carbon<00:03:13.470> fiber

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
this is a manners T to 90% carbon fiber

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.530 
this is a manners T to 90% carbon fiber
stock<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.580> real<00:03:14.760> lightweight<00:03:15.030> stock

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
stock so it's a real lightweight stock

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.990 
stock so it's a real lightweight stock
and<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:16.440> went<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.890> remington<00:03:17.460> varmint

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
