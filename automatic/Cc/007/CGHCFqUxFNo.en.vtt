00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it starts out pretty pretty simple we're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
it starts out pretty pretty simple we're
actually<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> double

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900

actually going to do with the double
extractor<00:00:31.470> trick<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.130> where<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.520> going

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
extractor trick here where we're going

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
extractor trick here where we're going
to<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> full<00:00:33.210> ten<00:00:34.200> ten<00:00:35.300> supply<00:00:36.440> 10<00:00:37.440> drones

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to get a full ten ten supply 10 drones

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
to get a full ten ten supply 10 drones
and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> create<00:00:39.899> two

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and then we're going to create two

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
and then we're going to create two
extractors<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.610> hear

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
extractors you see we do that here hear

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.340 
extractors you see we do that here hear
anything<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.300> creating<00:00:43.110> those<00:00:43.170> two

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
anything right creating those two

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.770 
anything right creating those two
extractors<00:00:43.860> frees<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.090> supply<00:00:45.480> for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
extractors frees up two more supply for

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
extractors frees up two more supply for
us<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.500> drones<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:47.969> soon<00:00:48.120> as

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
us to get two more drones and as soon as

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.369 
us to get two more drones and as soon as
those<00:00:48.360> drones<00:00:48.660> are<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
those drones are out we're going to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.490 
those drones are out we're going to
cancel<00:00:49.710> those<00:00:50.070> extractors<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.050> put<00:00:52.379> those

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
cancel those extractors and put those

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.979 
cancel those extractors and put those
drums<00:00:52.800> backing<00:00:53.100> minerals<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.360> get

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
drums backing minerals so I actually get

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.529 
drums backing minerals so I actually get
oversupplied<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.420> you're

Overlord now economic advantage of that

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.390 
Overlord now economic advantage of that
is<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.660> 25<00:01:04.080> minerals<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.799> create

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
is you know it's 25 minerals to create

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
is you know it's 25 minerals to create
the<00:01:06.060> extractor<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.720> only<00:01:06.960> six<00:01:07.350> minerals<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the extractor is only six minerals to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.280

and hopefully i slept get my slide three
drones<00:02:13.920> over<00:02:14.310> there<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.700> then<00:02:17.700> we're<00:02:17.880> going

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
drones over there and then we're going

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.690 
drones over there and then we're going
to<00:02:18.090> grab<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:18.750> overlord<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.130> next<00:02:20.430> unit

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
to grab an overlord is the next unit

to grab an overlord is the next unit
we're<00:02:20.850> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.500> train<00:02:22.500> out<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> hatchery

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
we're going to train out of the hatchery

we're going to train out of the hatchery
see<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.280> Roche<00:02:26.280> warn<00:02:26.549> go<00:02:26.760> down<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:28.519> right

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
see the Roche warn go down there right

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.789 
see the Roche warn go down there right
at<00:02:29.760> 18<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> probably<00:02:30.630> could<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.870> got<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.049> little

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
at 18 I probably could have got a little

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.370 
at 18 I probably could have got a little
bit<00:02:31.920> quicker<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:33.690> build<00:02:33.930> i'm<00:02:34.019> going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> post

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
bit quicker the build i'm going to post

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.600 
bit quicker the build i'm going to post
actually<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.340> no<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:35.790> was<00:02:35.880> about<00:02:36.239> right

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
actually well no that was about right

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.300 
actually well no that was about right
okay<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.750> Overlord<00:02:40.019> comes<00:02:40.320> out<00:02:40.530> Queen

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
okay so that Overlord comes out Queen

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.580 
okay so that Overlord comes out Queen
comes<00:02:41.610> out<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.030> get<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.360> spawn<00:02:42.660> larva<00:02:43.140> right

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
comes out and get the spawn larva right

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.620 
comes out and get the spawn larva right
away<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:44.040> reposition<00:02:44.850> my<00:02:44.970> queen<00:02:45.209> over<00:02:45.450> here

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
away I reposition my queen over here

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.090 
away I reposition my queen over here
where<00:02:45.810> she<00:02:46.080> could<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.350> useful<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.920> some

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
where she could be useful in some

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.550 
where she could be useful in some
defense<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:49.290> we're<00:02:49.380> really

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
defense and then so then we're really

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.490 
defense and then so then we're really
waiting<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.100> our<00:02:50.370> our<00:02:50.730> three<00:02:51.090> eggs<00:02:51.500> naturally

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
waiting for our our three eggs naturally

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.830 
waiting for our our three eggs naturally
from<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.769> hatchery<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.370> our<00:02:53.489> 4<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.820> pop<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.630> get

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
from the hatchery in our 4 to pop to get

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
from the hatchery in our 4 to pop to get
our<00:02:55.049> seven<00:02:55.620> roaches<00:02:56.070> which<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> name<00:02:56.700> of

the bill so the purpose here is to push

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.289 
the bill so the purpose here is to push
out<00:03:00.870> those<00:03:01.320> seven<00:03:01.769> roaches<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.430> apply<00:03:02.790> as<00:03:03.120> much

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299

so that you can secure your expansion as
soon<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:10.900> those<00:03:11.019> seven<00:03:11.319> roaches<00:03:11.620> are<00:03:11.739> out<00:03:13.260> we

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
soon as those seven roaches are out we

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.360 
soon as those seven roaches are out we
do<00:03:14.469> want<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.890> get<00:03:16.560> another<00:03:17.560> drone<00:03:17.890> another

Overlord<00:03:18.909> and<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:19.359> our<00:03:19.569> expansion<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.620> kind

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
Overlord and then our expansion you kind

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.500 
Overlord and then our expansion you kind
of<00:03:20.890> got<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.159> do<00:03:21.250> all<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.489> while<00:03:22.269> you're

marching those roaches over to your base
see<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.599> got<00:03:25.750> another<00:03:25.930> spawn<00:03:26.200> larva<00:03:26.590> there<00:03:29.489> you

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
see I got another spawn larva there you

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.210 
see I got another spawn larva there you
know<00:03:30.609> this<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.239> build<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:32.140> win<00:03:32.530> straight

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
know this this build can win straight

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.679 
know this this build can win straight

zerg<00:03:41.829> you're<00:03:42.159> probably<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.639> find

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
zerg you're probably going to find

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.429 
zerg you're probably going to find
yourself<00:03:42.939> pretty<00:03:43.420> evenly<00:03:43.780> matched<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
yourself pretty evenly matched and

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.599 
yourself pretty evenly matched and
against<00:03:44.709> terran<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.010> might<00:03:45.159> run<00:03:45.280> into<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.549> wall

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
against terran you might run into a wall

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.800 
against terran you might run into a wall
too<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.819> is<00:03:48.939> very<00:03:48.970> strong<00:03:49.540> against

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
too so but it is very strong against

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.819 
too so but it is very strong against
protoss<00:03:50.230> for<00:03:50.560> for<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.250> non<00:03:51.519> wall<00:03:51.849> reason<00:03:52.269> so

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
protoss for for that non wall reason so

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.750 
protoss for for that non wall reason so
ok<00:03:53.829> so<00:03:53.889> we're<00:03:54.069> going<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.250> move<00:03:54.340> all<00:03:54.430> seven

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
ok so we're going to move all seven

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.069 
ok so we're going to move all seven
roaches<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.209> here<00:03:55.569> you're<00:03:55.810> going<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.989> see

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
roaches out here you're going to see

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.190 
roaches out here you're going to see
them<00:03:56.260> get<00:03:56.439> my<00:03:56.650> expansion<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:58.599> got<00:03:59.169> another

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
them get my expansion I got another

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.399 
them get my expansion I got another
Overlord<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.099> got<00:04:00.250> another<00:04:00.519> drone<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:04.480> then<00:04:05.290> as

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
Overlord I got another drone and then as

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.869 
Overlord I got another drone and then as
soon<00:04:05.530> as<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.769> get<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:05.980> expansion<00:04:06.400> I'm<00:04:06.730> going

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
soon as I get that expansion I'm going

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.089 
soon as I get that expansion I'm going
to<00:04:06.939> saturate<00:04:07.120> all<00:04:07.510> my<00:04:07.659> gas<00:04:08.169> get<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.739> couple<00:04:09.010> more

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
to saturate all my gas get a couple more

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.939 
to saturate all my gas get a couple more
drones<00:04:09.400> at<00:04:09.609> my<00:04:09.730> main<00:04:09.939> and<00:04:10.349> upgrade<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.590> layer

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
drones at my main and upgrade to a layer

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.710 
drones at my main and upgrade to a layer
so<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.180> move<00:04:13.329> into<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.109> muta<00:04:14.440> tech<00:04:15.389> so<00:04:16.389> I

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
so I can move into to muta tech so I

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.260 
so I can move into to muta tech so I
hadn't<00:04:17.260> scouted<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.889> do<00:04:17.949> run<00:04:18.250> into<00:04:18.280> her<00:04:19.120> again

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
hadn't scouted I do run into her again

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.850 
hadn't scouted I do run into her again
gonna<00:04:22.270> find<00:04:22.510> herself<00:04:22.630> pretty<00:04:22.930> doing<00:04:23.320> match<00:04:23.500> we

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
gonna find herself pretty doing match we

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.439 
gonna find herself pretty doing match we
had<00:04:24.010> two<00:04:24.250> pairs<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.550> zerglings<00:04:24.909> in<00:04:25.180> five

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
had two pairs of zerglings in five

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.330 
had two pairs of zerglings in five
rotations

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
rotations

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.400 
rotations
so<00:04:27.690> probably<00:04:28.690> should<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.900> micro<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.380> a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
so probably should have micro that a

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.580 
so probably should have micro that a
little<00:04:29.710> bit<00:04:29.770> better<00:04:30.010> he<00:04:30.340> was<00:04:30.520> he<00:04:30.790> had<00:04:30.940> some<00:04:31.590> you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
little bit better he was he had some you

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.990 
little bit better he was he had some you
know<00:04:32.620> roaches<00:04:33.100> in<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.310> dark<00:04:33.520> there<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:33.940> were

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
know roaches in the dark there that were

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.930 
know roaches in the dark there that were
getting<00:04:34.270> hits<00:04:34.480> on<00:04:34.630> me<00:04:35.370> but<00:04:36.370> pretty<00:04:36.580> much<00:04:36.639> we

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
getting hits on me but pretty much we

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.969 
getting hits on me but pretty much we
just<00:04:37.180> swapped<00:04:37.660> blows<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.350> we're<00:04:38.590> back<00:04:38.830> to

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
just swapped blows and we're back to

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.939 
just swapped blows and we're back to
even<00:04:39.330> what's<00:04:40.330> not<00:04:40.570> even<00:04:40.990> though<00:04:41.199> is<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.530> I

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
even what's not even though is that I

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:51.210 
even what's not even though is that I
now<00:04:42.130> have<00:04:42.160> an<00:04:42.430> expansion<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:49.680> okay<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.040> then<00:04:51.160> I

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
now have an expansion and okay so then I

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.189 
now have an expansion and okay so then I
come<00:04:51.430> back<00:04:51.460> home<00:04:51.820> I'm<00:04:52.150> gonna<00:04:52.300> get<00:04:52.510> my<00:04:52.660> lair<00:04:52.900> I

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
come back home I'm gonna get my lair I

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.340 
come back home I'm gonna get my lair I
did<00:04:53.410> get<00:04:53.530> three<00:04:53.770> more<00:04:53.919> drones<00:04:54.280> they're

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
did get three more drones they're

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.570 
did get three more drones they're
waiting<00:04:56.350> for<00:04:56.500> my<00:04:56.590> expansion<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.160> build<00:04:57.370> here<00:04:57.550> I

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
waiting for my expansion to build here I

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.219 
waiting for my expansion to build here I
will<00:04:57.790> speed<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.270> up<00:04:58.449> just<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.960> tad<00:05:00.840> see<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.870> sent<00:05:02.139> a

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
will speed it up just a tad see I sent a

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:13.230 
will speed it up just a tad see I sent a
drone<00:05:02.440> over<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.919> get<00:05:03.100> two<00:05:03.850> more<00:05:04.000> extractors

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.940 

and<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.330> did<00:05:14.510> train<00:05:14.810> five<00:05:15.140> more<00:05:15.380> emotions<00:05:15.830> to

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
and I did train five more emotions to

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.890 
and I did train five more emotions to
kind<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.190> deal<00:05:16.370> with<00:05:16.610> this<00:05:16.730> little<00:05:16.940> cushion

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.850 

or<00:05:22.900> i<00:05:22.960> should<00:05:23.020> say<00:05:23.140> i<00:05:23.290> have<00:05:23.500> this<00:05:23.620> five

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
or i should say i have this five

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.690 
or i should say i have this five
military<00:05:24.190> training<00:05:24.640> anyway<00:05:26.430> okay<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.610> then

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
military training anyway okay and then

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.980 
military training anyway okay and then
we're<00:05:27.790> gonna<00:05:27.850> get<00:05:28.060> another<00:05:28.180> Queen<00:05:28.480> over<00:05:28.750> here

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
we're gonna get another Queen over here

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.510 
we're gonna get another Queen over here
so<00:05:29.290> we<00:05:29.320> can<00:05:29.470> get<00:05:29.590> as<00:05:29.710> much<00:05:29.830> production<00:05:30.190> out<00:05:30.460> of

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
so we can get as much production out of

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.420 
so we can get as much production out of
this<00:05:30.640> hatchery<00:05:30.880> as<00:05:31.180> possible<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:32.190> move<00:05:33.190> some

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
this hatchery as possible I move some

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.910 
this hatchery as possible I move some
more<00:05:33.520> drones<00:05:33.820> down<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.360> keep<00:05:34.540> my<00:05:34.690> gas<00:05:35.200> produce

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
more drones down to keep my gas produce

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.640 
more drones down to keep my gas produce
more<00:05:36.160> drones<00:05:36.400> here<00:05:36.730> I<00:05:37.600> don't<00:05:38.140> do<00:05:38.230> the<00:05:38.320> greatest

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
more drones here I don't do the greatest

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.260 
more drones here I don't do the greatest
job<00:05:38.920> after<00:05:39.520> this<00:05:39.640> you<00:05:39.820> know<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.000> point<00:05:40.180> of

job after this you know the point of

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.400 
job after this you know the point of
this<00:05:40.360> bill<00:05:40.570> was<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.840> really<00:05:40.960> show<00:05:41.200> you<00:05:41.290> guys

this bill was to really show you guys
that<00:05:41.470> opener<00:05:42.120> but<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.180> did<00:05:43.360> want<00:05:43.540> to<00:05:43.630> run<00:05:43.900> it<00:05:44.020> to

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
that opener but I did want to run it to

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.370 
that opener but I did want to run it to
completion<00:05:45.840> obviously<00:05:46.840> just<00:05:47.020> to<00:05:47.110> show<00:05:47.260> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
completion obviously just to show the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.900 
completion obviously just to show the
economic<00:05:47.860> advantage<00:05:48.310> and<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.550> advantage

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
economic advantage and the advantage

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.420 
economic advantage and the advantage
where<00:05:49.060> they've<00:05:49.180> having<00:05:49.420> to<00:05:49.570> hatcheries<00:05:50.110> write

where they've having to hatcheries write
produce<00:05:51.430> quite<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.820> bit<00:05:52.000> more<00:05:52.150> units<00:05:52.740> so<00:05:53.740> we'll

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
produce quite a bit more units so we'll

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.920 
produce quite a bit more units so we'll
go<00:05:53.950> for<00:05:54.220> X<00:05:54.490> here<00:05:54.700> until<00:05:55.030> I<00:05:55.060> get<00:05:55.240> my<00:05:55.390> army<00:05:55.720> up<00:05:55.810> to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
get my evolution chamber so I can

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.150 
get my evolution chamber so I can
upgrade<00:06:06.460> there<00:06:06.910> and<00:06:07.690> actually<00:06:08.500> get<00:06:08.740> speed
