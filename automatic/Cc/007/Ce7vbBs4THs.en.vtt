00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
cord itself what it does is that you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.749

of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.099> charging<00:02:26.640> dock<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.780> what<00:02:28.440> happens<00:02:28.769> is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
of the charging dock and what happens is

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.259 
of the charging dock and what happens is
you'll<00:02:29.340> see<00:02:29.489> like<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:29.940> green<00:02:30.090> light

you'll see like the little green light
flashing<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.349> means<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.680> charging<00:02:32.099> a

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
flashing and that means it's charging a

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.650 
flashing and that means it's charging a
full<00:02:33.599> charge<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.660> approximately

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
full charge for this is approximately

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.500 
full charge for this is approximately
around<00:02:37.560> maybe<00:02:37.860> about<00:02:38.069> 10<00:02:38.340> hours<00:02:38.459> or<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
around maybe about 10 hours or so but it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.740 
around maybe about 10 hours or so but it
should<00:02:39.720> last<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.260> up<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:41.129> about<00:02:41.519> six<00:02:42.000> days<00:02:42.360> of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
should last you up to about six days of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.900 
should last you up to about six days of
usage<00:02:43.590> which<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.069> great<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.489> when<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> leave
