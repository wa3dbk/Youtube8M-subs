 window its hello board you did 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150
 repeatedly point out that I 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.529
 very regular hair changes 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.789
 so it's true that sometimes I'm a 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 little pod a little ch sometimes 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 even a little white I fail curly 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.019
 short hair judge little long but 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.880
 how does she do to keep them as 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.149
 beautiful and well I have five products 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 scrunchies told us I'll go to them 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.360
 show like that you too will have 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.010
 as soon as beautiful wants because yes my 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 hair are naturally they are this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.989
 are real breasts do not change from 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.120
 as it holds the road only on nine or 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.450
 douala no we do not do that for this 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 following riels who is not one who is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 dedicated to hair here are the same 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 products then I'm going to do in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.570
 washing order is not it care 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.100
 because it makes noise 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.949
 so which one is he first is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 this one is a shampoo 1 to wash 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.729
 the hair when they are dirty so 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.689
 you can wash clean conditions 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.630
 also some that's a question 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.860
 usually we like we do not like short 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.060
 shampoo is cleanliness too 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 I chose this one that comes from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
 at weleda first it is 100% natural 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.240
 and that's good if the stuff a little bio 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 like that I like things 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 it's a dog tip a shampoo use 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.479
 frequent 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.680
 because I wash my hair 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.150
 every day I know it's bad 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 but I can not help it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.299
 for several reasons first because 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.600
 that paris pollution I do not like 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.040
 too much 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.170
 then I have hair that regresses 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.960
 easily and also because I have 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.479
 an ear here and at night when I sleep there 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 is developing like that and it looks like 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.600
 I led this growth on the head 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.790
 suddenly I have to wash myself for 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 back establish here so I wash them 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.970
 hair every day and even if it's 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.430
 not good it's okay because I have 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.719
 a free face shampoo when it is 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.979
 well why because first of all it is 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.479
 for the whole family that's good 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 because you can you can be full 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.590
 of people and that's not bad at all 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.420
 so he cleans gently and they 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.429
 preserve the natural shine of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.649
 hair here 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.590
 yes so here it is then it is at best a 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.390
 who is a what is it already said 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.769
 ungrateful mines and lo and behold - grasses and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.409
 So here you put grasses in 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.819
 your hair and everything is better 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.889
 then always at weleda 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.480
 this one is oat based and it's a 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.370
 after shampoo then first I like 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.799
 well colors I find it pretty 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.750
 it restores elasticity strength and shine 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.099
 with hair that means that when we have 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.450
 the hair any case are like that and 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 then who stand alone in place 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.230
 so they are dry and he is going to you 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.510
 reinvigorate all that and maybe it will 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.299
 also hair re hair and that's 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.909
 well and then you shine after you have the 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.049
 hair st1 as if it were hair 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.340
 of same baby site did take off 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.599
 coloring discolorations you have them 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.459
 keywords used africa and tickles 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.840
 once again we are clean 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.650
 got out of the shower because that's it 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.790
 it's in the shower we agree 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.150
 the after shampoo all that we have them a 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.859
 meaning 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.180
 it was a shampoo that stays on 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.790
 your head because almost all thanks where 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 it stuck it's not nice so we got it 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.269
 20 what happens next what is it that I 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.849
 put in my hair game but these 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.049
 who come from scott and I come to 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.889
 pronounce it and I even manage to write 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.299
 without mistakes it is an oil for the 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.849
 hair that we put on hair 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.440
 wet about the fate of the shower and 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.970
 we leave it on the hair so we 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.799
 would have a spa and it does not matter 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.180
 no it only feeds 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.989
 and besides that without loosening good I 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.819
 find that it was a little bit 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.709
 chaplaincy but that I think it's 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.449
 in my head but I find it a bit like 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.979
 so that's it for all types of 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.419
 hair it is thick it is fine 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.129
 it's dry that's a little bit 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.389
 trend a little fat where it goes when 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.459
 even because we do not put the root 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.169
 1 we are not happy with him but in 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.530
 parra otherwise it's useless to wash 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.180
 hair 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.659
 here is an oil spray here 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.829
 like that's where hop and on leash and 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.120
 besides, I even advise you to 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.319
 leave a little dry your hair 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.729
 like that would be natural already because 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.560
 it's better for them and more like that 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.319
 said he was fine 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.129
 next step so I have two little ones this 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.359
 ready 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.939
 we will not put at the same time because 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.220
 that too much of that loan you spray it then 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:05.099
 this one comes from aurel 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.009
 cl net like lacquer but it's not a 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.259
 lacquer we do not mistaken then this spray 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.939
 is a styling spray actually it goes 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.680
 discipline and the hair is not it 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.829
 so we put it on wet hair 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.510
 as well I put on the louis 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.410
 it's good because it smoothes 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.080
 beautiful and that frankly 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.920
 what more could I ask for 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.050
 him this magnificent game shoot down they 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.460
 look at this is so that's good 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.630
 so that's what I choose me 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.580
 when I decided to have hair 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.190
 all smooth the chopsticks as 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.780
 today but there are days when I 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.490
 I change my mind telling you not know 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.690
 but you will perhaps make thee 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.860
 curls you do not know where you want 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.260
 to have completed more needs a little bit of 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.640
 volume like that on t4 hair because 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.710
 I do not have a lot of games that are 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.230
 small but for that I the myths before 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.970
 to go near behind there is not this one 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.730
 i like me isabelle wekstein 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.650
 and that's good to say it also comes from 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.810
 scop dryers that I know to say write 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.920
 but if the villains osys more you 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.280
 know it's what you buy from 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.040
 hairdresser 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.690
 if tom joad national in France is a 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.690
 dry balm for people who are not 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.090
 bilingual so what he serves it serves 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.180
 is illuminated the hair first but he 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.280
 also serves to refresh and aerate the 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.360
 hair that is actually when you 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.130
 have applied then careful it takes 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.270
 apply it on dry hair and 25 cm 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.040
 so you take your rule you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.910
 calculate it's been 25 years if you are 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.590
 have big feet you can not 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:30.290
 succeeded like that yes 25 centimeters is 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.400
 not a rule no with low can not 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:39.890
 this word a shoe to all so we go 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:46.850
 do as you there are what you wear 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:48.290

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.130

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.700
 39 pray to you like that and there 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.470
 immediately it's amazing but 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.550
 actually saher the capillary hair so 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.300
 here you have the impression to have a 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.970
 little more volume 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.910
 I like it a lot and then it 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.530
 feel good I want near 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.919
 recap 1 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.240
 we wash with that the frequent use for 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.490

 ladies and gentlemen and finally when we 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.550
 decided to have a little more volume 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.440
