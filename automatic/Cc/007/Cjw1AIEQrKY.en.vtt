I keep a whole stack of white rags

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.580 
I keep a whole stack of white rags
instead<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.840> using<00:03:02.020> paper<00:03:02.290> towels<00:03:07.440> I'm<00:03:08.440> going

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
instead of using paper towels I'm going

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.410

do<00:04:15.590> something<00:04:15.980> different<00:04:16.310> um<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.519> other<00:04:16.670> one

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.220

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
lavender maybe more than half there

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.439

I<00:04:43.539> do<00:04:43.599> with<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:45.599> you<00:04:46.599> know<00:04:46.689> I<00:04:46.719> have<00:04:46.990> this
