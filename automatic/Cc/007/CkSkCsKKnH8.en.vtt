00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.710
 in the Soviet Union with the initiative of creating 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.630
 intercontinental high-speed 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.630
 the bomber first made 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.639
 Vladimir Mischuk 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.610
 he assured that the flight range 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.590
 the plane will be at least twelve 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320
 thousand km 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.360
 in a government decree 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.170
 design and construction 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.529
 bombers 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.079
 came out in spring 50 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 n about two years 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.359
 twentieth january fifty third 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.350
 this is a big blow and why raised 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.650
 bombers 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 the plane had bicycle chassis 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010
 flexible arrowhead addition 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.979
 cockpit german 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.850
 ejection seats 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.269
 percentage of novelty 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.269
 and therefore risks 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 bomber was equipped with 4 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.060
 at that time the most powerful in the world 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.960
 Olympiad winners 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 each of them created a takeoff 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.230
 traction almost 9 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.740
 the tests were intense 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.150
 condry engines 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.070
 new system refused one after 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.730
 other 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.810
 but the main 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.390
 promised by the designer 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 a distance of 12 thousand kilometers 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.290
 didn't reach 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.670
 the team was threatened 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 closing the program 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 with all the consequences 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.860
 initiative again passed thousands 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 Vladimir Mikhailovich proposed a number of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.710
 measures are designed to bring it further 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.500
 bomber such as 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.400
 already in the manufacture of the second experienced 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.469
 instance m 4 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:37.890
 so called aircraft 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.720
 war was declared overweight 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.170
 each shot by rationalization 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.969
 kilogram 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.790
 appointed 3 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.710
 chassis equipped with a mechanism 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 reared 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.000
 this adaptation is essential 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.160
 exceeded 90 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.100
 the car was tested in just 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.230
 four months 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
 she showed a speed of 950 kilometers 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 and range 9,500 colonies 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.510
 but it was less than promised 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.270
 allowed to fly over 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.679
 ocean 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.219
 for example from Moscow to Washington a little 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.959
 less than eight thousand crowns 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.769
 bomber urgently launched all 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.049
 May 1st 1950 fourth year 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.419
 m 4 flew over the red square 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.009
 in the same year the cars became hastily 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.079
 pass on humanity 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.509
 do I have to say what impression 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.109
 produced a new bomber 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.929
 raiders 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.419
 after the war not even ten years 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.049
 many still remember those aircraft 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.169
 still generally everywhere flew 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.169
 2 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:48.269
 and then 180 tons and the beautiful sleep carry 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.840
 meter wing span 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.840
 able to fly to another continent 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.389
 however, continuous improvement in the process 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.889
 mass production 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.819
 led to the fact that the aircraft strongly 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.759
 different from one another 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.229
 it made life very difficult and 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.039
 pilot 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.969
 but who will pay attention to 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.769
 such trifles when on the eve 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.809
 competition foe worth 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.809
 the fate of the country 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.419
 m 4 became the world's first jet 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.419
 strategic bomber 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
 entered service 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.849
 the plane was equipped with a barbell until tomorrow 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.019
 arch first tests were carried out over 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:30.779
 teachers 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.249
 and since then the system has been enough 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:34.749
 worked well 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.409
 it was she who became the primary means and 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.409
 lengthening of a threatening ball long-range aviation 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.940
 on that 16 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.750
 used quite complicated 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.750
 the circuit will tell you opened 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.499
 for large machines 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.499
 seemed to be the best refueling last 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.029
 upon receipt of service 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:06.260
 bombers 3 km 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.560
 m 4 reworked these giants into the tanker 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.510
 could share with 40 tons of fuel with 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.400
 one refueling range 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.760
 bomber 3 km increased from 12 to 15 with 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.909
 half thousand kilometers 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.249
 soon, as it were, myasishcheva presented 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.129
 missile version of the aircraft 3 km 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.559
 however intended to 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.739
 him cruise missiles so they brought to mind 

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:33.580
 and the system was left without a main combat 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.900
 tank
