00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello every year, call details today 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 I'll be there for you as 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 impartial the old books and rare good 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.880
 it is very common to buy used book 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.590
 especially when you are a student 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.470
 yet even if you are not a student 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.119
 you find a rare book usually 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 not in great condition 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.849
 ie a good state of conservation of 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.400
 some kind of maintenance some care 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 Special 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.870
 spending little or almost nothing and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 some materials that fetch you can 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.140
 have in your house 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.680
 well the first material we will use 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.680
 the gel alcohol 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.030
 his percentage here is 65% 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 a know which differs 65 and 70 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.710
 in this case it could even be alcohol 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.030
 liquid 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.129
 because we will not pass on the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.210
 more surfaces use paper 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 hygienic 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.060
 I have something so I will apply none 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.650
 but the rest of the materials 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.650
 such as a sandpaper 600 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.990
 around 1 and 20 if you do not have the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.090
 your home a hardware store 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.720
 construction comes to you value of a real 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.950
 and twenty cotton is in the part of $ 3 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.009
 papers come with sure you have at home 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:58.350
 good the last material I like today 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:02:03.960
 of sodium also the last used 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 also so I do not have the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.950
 book now to use but I'll show you the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 possibilities to apply for good 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 and here a point 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.330
 I had already selected an old book 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.120
 karate hours living conditions all 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 written this kind of thing does not come out 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.190
 I do not think it's good for you to go through 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.190
 first because the surface of the paper 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.440
 that paper that receives a layer 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:52.299
 plastic is easier and does not actually 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:57.540
 exit, but sometimes so that the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.540
 album does not show up easily 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.660
 on paper a little bit you 'll get 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:16.140
 open the book well look 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.379
 even if it's paper it does not have 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.379
 no problem 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.300
 now when the book is very rare and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.080
 requires a little more care, right? 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:44.690
 How did I say the difference ink does not come out? 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:46.879
 but in some ways the role that the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.010
 alcohol strip more generous you ask 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:55.880
 our magistrates the book is not the focus 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:59.989
 does not spoil or with a strip not 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.560
 If a book with this just this 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.810
 material mirrored here 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.970
 alcohol does not take brightness by 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:23.709
 contrary is more expressive until the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:23.709
 cleaning up a neuro as I said now 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:55.479
 the edges carefully understood the cover 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:55.479
 the sheet of paper in a bit will 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.840
 take care of rare books, then 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.840
 important to be very careful 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.570
 with the result is immediate 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.380
 it turns white is that my 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:31.270
 my webcam is very nice but it's 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:33.770
 noticeable that the change if the book 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:48.310
 has some bad smell that is not the case 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:48.310
 of some branded products 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:06:28.990
 in the book on several pages of it and in 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.990
 sequence in a place 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:47.360
 Be careful in there three days. 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:51.669
 that strong smell the book has some 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.669
 rare books neither compensates 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:05.889
 so some things 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:19.729
 on page it can paper water paper 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.849
 paper 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.419
 So I do not think it's legal, do not be composed. 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.919
 from water 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.580
 the chemical composition of alcohol in 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.289
 truth 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.270
 Rosary will leave parents I did not decide 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.639
 flame including on the cover 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.889
 There is no problem here with a cleaning 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.650
 external finishing of things 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:40.319
 easier for you to clean from you 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.870
 and another very important tip is 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:46.219
 You always have such a duster. 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:54.650
 of pen in your house so you think 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:59.039
 this way apart all aligned 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.860
 this way accumulates and it does not 

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:04.349
 so yellowed with the action of time 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.729
 we can not help but something 

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:07.169
 people can do 

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:10.219
 so these are my tips I 

00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:10.219
 I hope everyone has enjoyed it
