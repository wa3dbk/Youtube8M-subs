perspective on this I'll give this

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.700 
perspective on this I'll give this
analogy<00:01:32.759> let's<00:01:33.090> say<00:01:33.270> there's<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> person

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
analogy let's say there's this person

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
analogy let's say there's this person
that<00:01:34.740> wants<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> draw<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.729> picture<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.509> dog

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that wants to draw a picture of a dog

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.440 
that wants to draw a picture of a dog
but<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.320> no<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.880> artistic

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
but they have no you know artistic

but they have no you know artistic
skills<00:01:39.689> whatsoever<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.650> instead<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.400> just

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
skills whatsoever so instead they just

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
skills whatsoever so instead they just
go<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> stencil<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.840> dog<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:44.159> know

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
go get a stencil of a dog and you know

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
go get a stencil of a dog and you know
the<00:01:44.399> stencil<00:01:44.790> restricts<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> pencil<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> such

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the stencil restricts the pencil in such

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
the stencil restricts the pencil in such
a<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> they<00:01:46.649> almost<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.070> no<00:01:47.310> choice

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a way that they almost have no choice

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.270 
a way that they almost have no choice
but<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> draw<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> dog<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
but to draw the dog like but then you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
but to draw the dog like but then you
might<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.610> somebody<00:01:50.850> who's<00:01:51.110> artistic<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
might have somebody who's artistic and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
might have somebody who's artistic and
you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.220> could<00:01:53.369> probably<00:01:53.520> free<00:01:53.820> hand

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you know they could probably free hand

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
you know they could probably free hand
that<00:01:54.180> same<00:01:54.420> dog<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> look<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.799> as

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that same dog and make it look just as

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.399 
that same dog and make it look just as
good<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.969> could<00:01:57.060> probably<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.810> picture

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
good and it could probably do a picture

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.600 
good and it could probably do a picture
of<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> dog<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> whole<00:01:59.100> bunch<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> different

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
of a dog in a whole bunch of different

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.319 
of a dog in a whole bunch of different
ways<00:01:59.759> well<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.880> stencil<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.030> like

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
ways well you know the stencil is like

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
ways well you know the stencil is like
the<00:02:03.479> cleaning<00:02:03.780> approach<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.290> diet<00:02:04.500> dining

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the cleaning approach to diet dining

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.700 
the cleaning approach to diet dining
weight<00:02:05.579> loss<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.110> flexible<00:02:07.110> dieting<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.560> more

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
weight loss and flexible dieting is more

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.740 
weight loss and flexible dieting is more
like<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.310> freehand

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
like the freehand

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.990 
like the freehand
approach<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> case<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.729> person

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
approach so in the case of the person

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.400 
approach so in the case of the person
who's<00:02:11.120> just<00:02:11.330> starting<00:02:11.480> out<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.320> know

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
who's just starting out you know

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.780 
who's just starting out you know
sometimes<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.920> more<00:02:12.980> critical<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
sometimes it's more critical to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.120 
sometimes it's more critical to
establish<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.630> hierarchy<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.260> importance<00:02:15.890> like

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
establish a hierarchy of importance like

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.710 
establish a hierarchy of importance like
it's<00:02:16.700> got<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:16.940> very<00:02:16.970> apparent<00:02:17.510> that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
it's got to be very apparent that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.810 
it's got to be very apparent that
getting<00:02:18.320> in<00:02:18.410> shape<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.830> more<00:02:19.310> important<00:02:19.760> than

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
getting in shape is more important than

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.000 
getting in shape is more important than
eating<00:02:19.970> your<00:02:20.210> favorite<00:02:20.480> foods<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.890> know

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
eating your favorite foods and you know

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.620 
eating your favorite foods and you know
you<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.460> know<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.970> their<00:02:23.210> favorite<00:02:23.360> foods

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
you and I know that their favorite foods

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.120 
you and I know that their favorite foods
in<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.110> themselves<00:02:24.140> aren't<00:02:24.710> preventing

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
in and of themselves aren't preventing

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.070 
in and of themselves aren't preventing
them<00:02:25.220> from<00:02:25.250> making<00:02:25.459> progress<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.990> know

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
them from making progress but you know

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.110 
them from making progress but you know
just<00:02:27.110> having<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.770> option<00:02:28.100> on<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> table<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
just having that option on the table is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.510 
just having that option on the table is
too<00:02:29.780> similar<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.620> their<00:02:30.830> current<00:02:30.980> lifestyle

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
too similar to their current lifestyle

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.960 
too similar to their current lifestyle
so<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.690> some<00:02:32.900> people<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:34.490> just<00:02:34.820> makes

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so for some people and that just makes

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.460 
so for some people and that just makes
it<00:02:35.060> too<00:02:35.180> easy<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.600> over<00:02:35.840> indulge<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.380> then

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
it too easy to over indulge and then

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.070 
it too easy to over indulge and then
ultimately<00:02:36.709> not<00:02:37.310> make<00:02:37.550> progress<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.690> for<00:02:39.020> that

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
ultimately not make progress so for that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.449 
ultimately not make progress so for that
reason<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.530> don't<00:02:39.709> completely<00:02:40.010> knock<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
reason I don't completely knock the

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.710 
reason I don't completely knock the
clean<00:02:40.670> eating<00:02:40.850> lifestyle<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.660> mean

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
clean eating lifestyle you know I mean

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.110 
clean eating lifestyle you know I mean
like<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.920> can<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.160> used<00:02:43.370> as<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> tool<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
like it's it can be used as a tool to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000 
like it's it can be used as a tool to
establish<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> certain<00:02:45.230> level<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.530> discipline

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
establish a certain level of discipline

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.370 
establish a certain level of discipline
and<00:02:46.250> somebody's<00:02:46.610> life<00:02:46.790> right<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:48.290> I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and somebody's life right but like I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.479 
and somebody's life right but like I
said<00:02:48.470> everybody<00:02:48.739> doesn't<00:02:48.980> need<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.250> there's

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
said everybody doesn't need this there's

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.010 
said everybody doesn't need this there's
some<00:02:49.640> people<00:02:49.910> who<00:02:50.030> are<00:02:50.120> out<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.300> shape<00:02:50.420> but

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
some people who are out of shape but

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.360 
some people who are out of shape but
they<00:02:51.140> have<00:02:51.320> discipline<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.250> they

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
they have discipline it's just that they

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.890 
they have discipline it's just that they
haven't<00:02:52.520> been<00:02:52.670> focusing<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:53.660> area

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
haven't been focusing it on this area

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.690 
haven't been focusing it on this area
their<00:02:54.140> life<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.800> can<00:02:54.950> show<00:02:55.100> them<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
their life and you can show them the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.610 
their life and you can show them the
flexible<00:02:56.090> dieting<00:02:56.300> protocol<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.230> they'll

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
flexible dieting protocol and they'll

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.770 
flexible dieting protocol and they'll
have<00:02:57.770> success<00:02:58.100> with<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.370> right<00:02:58.730> away<00:02:58.790> but

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
have success with it right away but

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.630 
have success with it right away but
other<00:03:00.110> people<00:03:00.440> need<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.100> restriction<00:03:01.550> they

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
other people need the restriction they

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.150 
other people need the restriction they
need<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.060> guidelines<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.739> know<00:03:03.860> at

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
need the guidelines and you know at

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.100 
need the guidelines and you know at
least<00:03:04.220> at<00:03:04.610> first<00:03:04.670> or<00:03:05.270> sometimes<00:03:05.780> they<00:03:06.080> just

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
least at first or sometimes they just

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.870 
least at first or sometimes they just
need<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.530> all<00:03:06.620> together<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:07.489> fine<00:03:07.700> too

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
need it all together and that's fine too

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.699 
need it all together and that's fine too
all<00:03:08.720> right<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:08.959> now<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.320> got<00:03:09.350> all<00:03:09.470> that

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
all right so now that we got all that

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.830 
all right so now that we got all that
out<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.980> way<00:03:10.100> let's<00:03:10.370> think<00:03:11.270> about<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.600> type

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
out the way let's think about the type

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.110 
out the way let's think about the type
of<00:03:11.870> person<00:03:12.110> who<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.799> knocking<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.880> for<00:03:14.030> your

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
of person who is knocking you for your

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.420 
of person who is knocking you for your
flexible<00:03:14.450> diet<00:03:14.630> approach<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:15.980> pretty

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
flexible diet approach right it's pretty

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.130 
flexible diet approach right it's pretty
obvious<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:16.910> they<00:03:17.360> take<00:03:17.600> pride<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.019> fact

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
obvious that they take pride in the fact

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.120

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
everything you're not just fitness so if

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.830 
everything you're not just fitness so if
this<00:03:49.010> person<00:03:49.579> since<00:03:49.880> their<00:03:50.060> self-worth<00:03:50.329> is

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
this person since their self-worth is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.750 
this person since their self-worth is
based<00:03:51.380> on<00:03:51.560> something<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.010> fragile<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:52.579> this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
based on something so fragile like this

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.710 
based on something so fragile like this
is<00:03:52.880> why<00:03:52.970> they<00:03:53.090> feel<00:03:53.209> like<00:03:53.299> they're<00:03:53.570> better

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
is why they feel like they're better

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.360 
is why they feel like they're better
than<00:03:53.780> somebody<00:03:54.170> else<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:54.860> let<00:03:55.040> them<00:03:55.160> have<00:03:55.340> it

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370

than somebody else just let them have it
you<00:03:55.730> know<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:55.940> have<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.150> realize<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.660> these

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
you know you have to realize it these

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.890 
you know you have to realize it these
moments<00:03:57.440> are<00:03:57.739> not<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:59.000> best<00:03:59.299> time<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.690> try<00:03:59.840> to
