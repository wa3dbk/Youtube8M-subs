00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
with just malt I do it this way because

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.809 
with just malt I do it this way because
I<00:03:43.890> like<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> little<00:03:44.370> bit<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.519> heat<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
I like a little bit of heat to the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.860 
I like a little bit of heat to the
either<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:46.230> white<00:03:46.440> takes<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> bulk

either and the white takes up the bulk

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.420 
either and the white takes up the bulk
