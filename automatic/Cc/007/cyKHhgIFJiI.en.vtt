get<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> power<00:01:54.780> saving<00:01:55.290> mode<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.280> also

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
get the power saving mode and you also

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
get the power saving mode and you also
do<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> fingerprint<00:01:57.390> scanner<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
do get the fingerprint scanner on the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.520 
do get the fingerprint scanner on the
front<00:01:58.770> side<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.420> here's<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> big<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.469> me

personally and that is that it's both
dust<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.200> waterproof<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:07.110> love<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> have

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
dust and waterproof I would love to have

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
dust and waterproof I would love to have
it<00:02:07.770> live<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.129> bigger<00:02:08.340> than<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.879> two

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
it live with bigger than from with two

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.969 
it live with bigger than from with two
inches<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.110> had<00:02:10.229> rumors<00:02:10.470> about<00:02:10.709> 20

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
inches then we had rumors about 20

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.650 
inches then we had rumors about 20
megapixel<00:02:11.370> camera<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:11.970> also

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
megapixel camera and also

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.350 
megapixel camera and also
about<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.990> exclusive<00:02:13.770> galaxy<00:02:14.250> s5<00:02:14.580> like

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
about the exclusive galaxy s5 like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320 
about the exclusive galaxy s5 like
aluminum<00:02:15.960> or<00:02:16.200> something<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:17.850> mean<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.180> can

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
aluminum or something so I mean they can

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
aluminum or something so I mean they can
take<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> different<00:02:18.660> work<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.500> stuff<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
take a different work on stuff in the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.550 
take a different work on stuff in the
future<00:02:20.690> they<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.900> make<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.380> bit

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
future they can make it a little bit

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710 
future they can make it a little bit
more<00:02:22.800> interesting<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.850> was<00:02:24.270> probably<00:02:24.540> hoping

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
more interesting I was probably hoping

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.670 
more interesting I was probably hoping
for<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> little<00:02:25.380> bit<00:02:25.560> more<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.600> but<00:02:27.600> I'm<00:02:28.320> still

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
for a little bit more here but I'm still

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.620 
for a little bit more here but I'm still
pretty<00:02:28.920> pretty<00:02:29.160> satisfied<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.210> 1080p

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
pretty pretty satisfied but the 1080p

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.200 
pretty pretty satisfied but the 1080p
only<00:02:31.020> display<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.700> mean<00:02:32.700> when<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:33.000> hear<00:02:33.180> rumors

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
only display I mean when we hear rumors

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.060 
only display I mean when we hear rumors
about<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.200> would<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.440> way<00:02:34.620> better<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
about that it would be way better and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.570 
about that it would be way better and
you<00:02:35.640> also<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> 4k<00:02:36.800> video<00:02:37.800> recording<00:02:37.860> at

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
you also do get a 4k video recording at

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.040 
you also do get a 4k video recording at
30<00:02:38.970> frames<00:02:39.180> per<00:02:39.330> second<00:02:39.750> same<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.460> z2<00:02:42.050> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
30 frames per second same as the z2 you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440 
30 frames per second same as the z2 you
have<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> new<00:02:43.590> version<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.920> s<00:02:44.070> health<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.670> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
have a new version on s health and this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.150 
have a new version on s health and this
ultra<00:02:45.750> power<00:02:45.930> saving<00:02:46.020> mode<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.710> will<00:02:46.740> be<00:02:47.100> able

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
ultra power saving mode it will be able

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280 
ultra power saving mode it will be able
to<00:02:47.370> turn<00:02:47.550> everything<00:02:47.820> from<00:02:48.150> white<00:02:48.480> or<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.020> like

to turn everything from white or to like
black<00:02:50.030> which<00:02:51.030> could<00:02:51.570> be<00:02:52.050> kind<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.650> interesting

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
black which could be kind of interesting

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.950 
black which could be kind of interesting
I<00:02:53.550> don't<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.300> full<00:02:54.570> specs

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
I don't think this is the full specs

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.110 
I don't think this is the full specs
here<00:02:55.080> I'm<00:02:55.260> gonna<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.950> probably<00:02:56.910> make<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
here I'm gonna go and probably make a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.390 
here I'm gonna go and probably make a
video<00:02:57.270> gsmarena<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.560> shake<00:02:58.800> them<00:02:58.950> off<00:02:59.040> more

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
video gsmarena and shake them off more

video gsmarena and shake them off more
at<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.330> graphic<00:03:00.690> processing<00:03:01.080> unit<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.680> then

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
at the graphic processing unit and then

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.680 
at the graphic processing unit and then
all<00:03:02.130> those<00:03:02.310> things<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.600> it
