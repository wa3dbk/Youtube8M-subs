way<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.170> needed<00:01:27.500> something<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.800> was<00:01:27.920> gonna

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
way so I needed something that was gonna

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.920 
way so I needed something that was gonna
hook<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.580> was<00:01:28.700> what<00:01:28.820> was<00:01:28.909> basically<00:01:29.300> driving

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
hook that was what was basically driving

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.860 
hook that was what was basically driving
the<00:01:30.140> 275<00:01:30.710> any<00:01:31.070> other<00:01:31.280> wide-body<00:01:31.870> to

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
the 275 any other wide-body to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.450 
the 275 any other wide-body to
accommodate<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.770> was<00:01:34.160> kind<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.340> just

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
accommodate that I was kind of just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.969 
accommodate that I was kind of just
looking<00:01:34.640> at<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.940> displacement<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.979> fact

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
looking at the displacement and the fact

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.530 
looking at the displacement and the fact
that<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.280> forced<00:01:37.550> induction<00:01:37.700> all-wheel

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
that it's forced induction all-wheel

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.450 
that it's forced induction all-wheel
drive<00:01:38.810> low<00:01:39.500> coefficient<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:40.040> drag<00:01:40.160> it<00:01:40.369> all

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
drive low coefficient of drag it all

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.730 
drive low coefficient of drag it all
seemed<00:01:40.640> like<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.820> recipe<00:01:41.060> for<00:01:41.300> success<00:01:41.869> with

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
seemed like a recipe for success with

00:01:42.740 --> 00:02:46.140
