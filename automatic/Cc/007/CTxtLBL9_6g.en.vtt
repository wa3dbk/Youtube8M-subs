00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
about this part in a minute you've got

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
about this part in a minute you've got
one<00:00:34.170> end<00:00:34.379> that's<00:00:34.680> fixed<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.579> end<00:00:35.760> that's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
one end that's fixed and one end that's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
one end that's fixed and one end that's
free<00:00:36.240> I'm<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.810> to<00:00:36.870> uncoil<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.030> cable<00:00:40.040> just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
free I'm going to uncoil the cable just

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.060 
free I'm going to uncoil the cable just
kind<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.220> like<00:00:41.400> let<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> fall<00:00:42.890> make<00:00:43.890> their

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
kind of like let that fall make their

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.630 
kind of like let that fall make their
sure<00:00:44.280> that's<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.640> straightened<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:46.640> now

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
sure that's all straightened out now

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.030 
sure that's all straightened out now
I've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:48.120> again<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.960> end<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.320> fixed<00:00:49.739> one

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
I've got again one end that's fixed one

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.220 
I've got again one end that's fixed one
in<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.370> free<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.540> first<00:00:51.780> step<00:00:51.930> in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
in that's free so the first step in

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
in that's free so the first step in
determining<00:00:52.489> what<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.670> doing<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.060> is<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
determining what you're doing here is to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
determining what you're doing here is to
find<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> ideal<00:00:55.739> length<00:00:56.040> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> cable<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
find the ideal length of the cable for

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.560 
find the ideal length of the cable for
you<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.110> do<00:00:58.380> that<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> I'm<00:01:00.420> going

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you so to do that what I do is I'm going

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.450 
you so to do that what I do is I'm going
to<00:01:00.660> step<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> rope<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.980> foot<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to step on the rope with one foot and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
to step on the rope with one foot and
then<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.880> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> draw<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.360> cable<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.110> or

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
then I'm going to draw the cable up or

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
then I'm going to draw the cable up or
the<00:01:04.589> handles<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:06.000> chest<00:01:06.299> level

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the handles up to about my chest level

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.080 
the handles up to about my chest level
now<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.350> better<00:01:07.770> jumpers<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> jump

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
now the better jumpers are going to jump

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.789 
now the better jumpers are going to jump
with<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> rope<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.870> shorter<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
with the rope a little shorter and if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
with the rope a little shorter and if
you're<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.100> learning<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:12.150> form<00:01:12.810> isn't

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you're just learning or your form isn't

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.500 
you're just learning or your form isn't
quite<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.650> maybe<00:01:14.430> wide<00:01:14.760> hand<00:01:15.150> something

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
quite right maybe wide hand something

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.760 
quite right maybe wide hand something
like<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> you're<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.320> jump<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
like that you're going to jump with the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
like that you're going to jump with the
rope<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.250> longer<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.820> somewhere<00:01:18.270> from

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
rope a little longer so somewhere from

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
rope a little longer so somewhere from
bottom<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.590> pecs<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.280> clavicle<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
bottom of your pecs to your clavicle is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
bottom of your pecs to your clavicle is
kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.930> measure<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.740> start

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
kind of like a good measure to start

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.680 
kind of like a good measure to start
with<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.119> once<00:01:24.360> i<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> dialed<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:26.690> can

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
with so once i get that dialed in i can

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.359 
with so once i get that dialed in i can
go<00:01:27.780> ahead<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.020> Mark<00:01:28.350> where<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> rope

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
go ahead and Mark where I want the rope

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.260 
go ahead and Mark where I want the rope
to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> cut<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.470> step<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to be cut and that would be step to the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.630 
to be cut and that would be step to the
next<00:01:33.299> step<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> nice<00:01:34.799> pair<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> wire

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
next step is to get a nice pair of wire

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
next step is to get a nice pair of wire
cutters<00:01:38.180> we<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.360> these<00:01:39.479> right<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.080> we

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
cutters we have these right here that we

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
cutters we have these right here that we
sell<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.500> our<00:01:40.590> website<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.340> we'll<00:01:41.460> give

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you a nice clean cut on the wire if

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.480 
you a nice clean cut on the wire if
you've<00:01:43.650> got<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.830> good<00:01:44.070> pair<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> wire<00:01:44.460> cutters

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you've got a good pair of wire cutters

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
you've got a good pair of wire cutters
at<00:01:45.030> home<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.390> will<00:01:45.510> work<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.650> what

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
at home that will work as well so what

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.870 
at home that will work as well so what
I'm<00:01:46.830> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> mark<00:01:47.640> my

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm going to do is I'm going to mark my
