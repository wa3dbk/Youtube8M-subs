00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
think it's a sidewinder wire 3c Xbox 360

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.760 
think it's a sidewinder wire 3c Xbox 360
controller<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> basically<00:00:18.779> claimed<00:00:19.619> that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
controller that I basically claimed that

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
controller that I basically claimed that
pretty<00:00:20.100> much<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.240> casing<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> all

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
pretty much of all the casing and all

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.230 
pretty much of all the casing and all
the<00:00:22.590> electronics<00:00:23.250> okay<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.150> been

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the electronics okay this is I've been

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.609 
the electronics okay this is I've been
doing<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.539> market<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.109> hundred<00:00:25.320> thousand

anyway<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.160> hack<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.579> my<00:00:32.969> favorite

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
anyway the hack is that my favorite

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.440 
anyway the hack is that my favorite
games<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.050> type<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.550> arcades<00:00:35.550> racing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
games in that type of arcades racing

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.229 
games in that type of arcades racing
game<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> little<00:00:37.110> racing<00:00:37.530> games<00:00:37.770> most<00:00:38.309> cars

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
game is a little racing games most cars

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.080 
game is a little racing games most cars
and<00:00:39.690> offered<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> problem<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and offered like that but the problem is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.110 
and offered like that but the problem is
they<00:00:42.329> requires<00:00:42.920> 360<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.100> most<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> time

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
they requires 360 will most of the time

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
they requires 360 will most of the time
you<00:00:45.420> don't<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.840> 360<00:00:46.590> wheel<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.190> hard

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
you don't have a 360 wheel they are hard

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
you don't have a 360 wheel they are hard
to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.670> expensive<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.690> they're<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to get expensive and they're not that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
to get expensive and they're not that
easy<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> run<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> hard<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
easy to run not that hard but not that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
easy to run not that hard but not that
easy<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.170> looking<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.129> easy

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
easy so I was looking for a very easy

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.119 
easy so I was looking for a very easy
hack<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.989> found<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.500> very<00:00:55.739> cool

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
hack and I think I found one very cool

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.240 
hack and I think I found one very cool
ok<00:00:56.930> basically<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.199> created<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.890> haven't

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
ok basically I created that I haven't

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
ok basically I created that I haven't
seen<00:00:59.430> anybody<00:00:59.579> doing<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.000> before<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.750> maybe

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
seen anybody doing that before but maybe

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
ball rotates it rotates one of those

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.860 
ball rotates it rotates one of those
rods<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.700> makes<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> mass<00:02:21.209> go<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.750> down

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
rods that makes the mass go up and down

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.600 
rods that makes the mass go up and down
or<00:02:22.050> left<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.349> right<00:02:22.440> okay<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.340> how<00:02:23.550> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
or left and right okay that's how it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.580 
or left and right okay that's how it
works<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.330> those<00:02:24.420> mouths<00:02:24.660> okay<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
works for one of those mouths okay so I

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.260 
works for one of those mouths okay so I
took<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.920> ball<00:02:26.130> out<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.640> took<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.030> rod

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
took the ball out and I took the rod

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.000 
took the ball out and I took the rod
that<00:02:27.540> pulls<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.739> bother

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
that pulls up and down to not bother

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
that pulls up and down to not bother
that<00:02:29.580> access<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.300> get<00:02:30.450> noise<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.170> edie

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
that access and get noise and edie

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.460 
that access and get noise and edie
errors<00:02:32.190> from<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.480> kept<00:02:33.720> only<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> rod

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
errors from that and I kept only the rod

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.979 
errors from that and I kept only the rod
that<00:02:34.769> goes<00:02:35.420> horizontal<00:02:36.420> left<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.810> right

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
that goes horizontal left to right

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.440 
that goes horizontal left to right
basically<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.769> mouse<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.970> bought<00:02:39.300> it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
basically on the mouse and I bought it

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.790 
basically on the mouse and I bought it
because<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.989> runs<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.349> little<00:02:40.410> bit<00:02:40.590> more<00:02:40.739> on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
because that runs a little bit more on

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.759 
because that runs a little bit more on
the<00:02:40.860> left<00:02:41.040> side<00:02:41.300> okay<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.930> mouse<00:02:43.110> you're

it's done to ensure that the rubberband

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's done to ensure that the rubberband
right<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.750> gonna<00:02:57.989> touch<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:59.040> when

right here is not gonna touch and when

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.100 
right here is not gonna touch and when
you<00:02:59.250> do<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.549> this<00:03:00.480> side<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> mouth<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
you do that this side of the mouth the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.199 
you do that this side of the mouth the
plastic<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.769> casing<00:03:02.190> which<00:03:02.580> would<00:03:02.790> break<00:03:03.030> it

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
plastic the casing which would break it

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.600 
plastic the casing which would break it
after<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> while<00:03:03.750> all<00:03:04.049> right<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.340> that's

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.280 
after a while all right and so that's
the<00:03:05.819> problem<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.049> once<00:03:07.200> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
the problem and that's it and once you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.220 
the problem and that's it and once you
do<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.799> put<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.190> rubber<00:03:08.340> band<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.880> the

you know you check out the little rod
inside<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.849> mouse<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.959> slide<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
inside the mouse and you slide the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.380 
inside the mouse and you slide the
rubber<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.860> under<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.670> put<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.209> back
