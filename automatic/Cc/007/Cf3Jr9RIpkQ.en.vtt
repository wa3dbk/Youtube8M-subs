00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.920
 fc energy tv is presented to you by 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.520
 iceberg is your partner for media production 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.520
 and web solutions 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.340
 welcome two years with so 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.920
 play a lot but the first question applies 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.760
 no yesterday's challenge cold 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.460
 survived 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.270
 yes, yes perfect, I really have something 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.840
 made a bit tired though 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.350
 before 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.430
 after that you are wide awake and the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.690
 Team not synonymous again 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.580
 after the exciting game in hamburg 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.059
 So for me I have the boys on 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.710
 ground 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.800
 how can you do it in such a short time? 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.680
 to raise again we have a lot 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.730
 talked about what that led to 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.030
 that we showed such a good performance 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.910
 have and we considered how can you 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.890
 now transferred to the third league everyday 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.930
 and shown in the video that goes 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 and that many elements oppose us 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.440
 hamburg have also made strong in the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.200
 third league can grab if we can 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 stable on the place and that brings 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.470
 makes sure then I believe that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.390
 you forget the disappointment someday 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.950
 and I was looking forward to the next game 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.970
 Yesterday in Augsburg successful 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.500
 was operated 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.240
 I do not have myself with him yet 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.549
 but I heard that it was him 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.979
 it works and will be good at the latest 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.420
 tomorrow to contact him where 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.080
 you all the best and a quick one 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.080
 to desire convalescence 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.280
 So leo center in the reha after three 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.260
 weeks down there do his job 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.659
 and likes to work hard on his comeback 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.490
 it's here and can run that's good because 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.049
 he because he physically in the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.549
 the state remains in the one now and 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.460
 that will then go fast afterwards 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.780
 thomas hÃ¼bener is very hardworking and able 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 from next week with ball work 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780
 that means he will be too 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.210
 not too long missing and the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.560
 both keeper are already doing well 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.400
 So that slowly clears 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.400
 it's about time too 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.350
 beaten these uncomfortable opponents 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.130
 At home the team has to 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.080
 to adjust 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.120
 do you imagine it already becomes one 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.950
 again a typical third league match where 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.840
 the performance differences are minimal 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.489
 and where it matters a lot on small things 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.900
 Holstein Kiel is a very combative 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.670
 team a very strong 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.890
 Team like we do a lot about 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.800
 the collective comes and we have to 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.330
 have to counter and have if one more 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.739
 there is a lack of fatigue and disappointment 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.989
 is we must have the painting and decorating out 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.660
 because you have to kick off in the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.610
 third league to be on top of everything 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.750
 be prepared and fight the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.069
 Third league always gives accept next 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.299
 But do not play this game 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.620
 at least is already on tuesday 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.500
 somehow in wiesbaden 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.850
 what he loves to do on monday 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.190
 against the hsv hopes here as a team 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.250
 little support even on tuesday 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.810
 that was fantastic it really was 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.000
 a gooseflesh mood hardly in words 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.799
 also the players in training 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.350
 talked about how it looks 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.090
 also celebrated and like that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.400
 has led that one over pain limits 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.500
 can walk over it and all really 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.320
 nobody to quit the last percent 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.760
 can get out of it and that's why 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.380
 we hope that as many as possible 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.910
 people and his team to evening 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.650
 we have to support one of the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.910
 Top teams top favorite for me 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.859
 on the climb with two three others 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.500
 need teams together and there 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.680
 we change that mood again 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.680
 to be competitive
