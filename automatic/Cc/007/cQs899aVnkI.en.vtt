 on my facebook of my personal profile 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.169
 here is below I invite you to join 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.580
 as my friend because he is always giving 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.669
 updates and news about 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.890
 anything like raffles or any 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.900
 thing that we will be doing here in this 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.140
 channel now I just want to tell 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.030
 anyone who wins now does not 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.080
 we have made of guatemala or in the 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.770
 future that when I do a lottery and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.560
 well I'm going to sign with a carry 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.259
 I will send it if there is a guide number 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.539
 I'm going to give it away and when I get to 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.759
 guatemala or any other country that is 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.979
 If the government wants to buy you collect 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.539
 taxes or whatever and that's not 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:09.710
 My problem now is your problem 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:13.630
 in those countries that do not charge then 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.820
 well hopefully 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.130
 do not be very sad those who did not win 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.070
 because it comes a lot more raffles and they come 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.010
 the beats for 14 February to 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.080
 then friends, I love you all very much and 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.920
 keep watching my videos commenting 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.360
 because the winners come from there and I go 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.010
 to explain a little how it's going to change 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.280
 they raffled off the future to make it 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.270
 much easier still until then we 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.270
 we are going to talk
