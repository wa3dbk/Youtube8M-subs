people<00:02:56.550> are<00:02:56.640> dieting<00:02:57.090> with<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.960> regular

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
people are dieting with just a regular

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.340 
people are dieting with just a regular
me<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:59.010> know<00:02:59.130> regular<00:02:59.460> diet<00:03:00.110> eating<00:03:01.110> less

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
me you know regular diet eating less

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.130 
me you know regular diet eating less
calories<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.190> then<00:03:02.430> they<00:03:02.610> had<00:03:02.820> another<00:03:03.810> study

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
calories and then they had another study

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199 
calories and then they had another study
where<00:03:04.410> people<00:03:04.830> were<00:03:05.040> dieting<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:06.030> had

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
where people were dieting but they had

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.390 
where people were dieting but they had
to<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.450> eggs<00:03:06.720> every<00:03:07.020> morning<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.560> for

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
to have eggs every morning and for

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.180 
to have eggs every morning and for
whatever<00:03:08.580> reason<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:10.440> people<00:03:10.739> who<00:03:10.800> had<00:03:10.920> eggs

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
whatever reason the people who had eggs

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.300 
whatever reason the people who had eggs
every<00:03:11.550> morning<00:03:11.810> lost<00:03:12.810> more<00:03:13.170> along<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:13.980> waist

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
every morning lost more along the waist

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.820 
every morning lost more along the waist
and<00:03:14.550> some<00:03:15.330> people<00:03:15.600> think<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.020> one<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.770> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
and some people think that one of the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.040 
and some people think that one of the
reasons<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.520> will<00:03:18.030> suggest<00:03:18.270> that<00:03:18.660> anyways

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
reasons that will suggest that anyways

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.699 
reasons that will suggest that anyways
in<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.950> study<00:03:20.190> was<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.670> fact<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.709> instead

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
in the study was the fact that instead

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.860 
in the study was the fact that instead
of<00:03:22.770> having<00:03:23.480> except<00:03:24.480> having<00:03:24.690> food<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.640> sugary

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
of having except having food that sugary

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.620 
of having except having food that sugary
cereal<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:29.820> know<00:03:29.910> sometimes<00:03:30.330> through<00:03:30.570> a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
cereal or you know sometimes through a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.580 
cereal or you know sometimes through a
lesser<00:03:30.900> extent<00:03:31.200> fruit<00:03:31.620> they<00:03:32.280> had<00:03:33.110> eggs<00:03:34.110> which

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
lesser extent fruit they had eggs which

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.260 
lesser extent fruit they had eggs which
like<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.980> said<00:03:35.010> doesn't<00:03:35.489> raise<00:03:35.670> your<00:03:35.820> place<00:03:36.060> in

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
like I said doesn't raise your place in

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.090 
like I said doesn't raise your place in
mechanics<00:03:36.690> doesn't<00:03:37.110> cause<00:03:37.410> your<00:03:37.590> blood<00:03:37.800> sugar

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
mechanics doesn't cause your blood sugar

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.830 
mechanics doesn't cause your blood sugar
to<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.430> up<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.590> doesn't<00:03:40.590> quite<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.890> let<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
to go up and doesn't quite a let the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.020 
to go up and doesn't quite a let the
spike<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.200> cause<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.920> get<00:03:44.220> hungry<00:03:44.400> later<00:03:44.640> on

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
spike and cause you get hungry later on

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.600 
spike and cause you get hungry later on
so<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.600> find<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.320> eggs<00:03:46.500> are<00:03:46.680> very<00:03:46.950> filling<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
so I find that eggs are very filling and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.940 
so I find that eggs are very filling and
any<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:49.050> you're<00:03:49.350> trying<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.680> build

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
any you know you're trying to build

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.360 
any you know you're trying to build
muscle<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.910> should<00:03:51.510> have<00:03:52.040> eggs<00:03:53.040> at

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
muscle I think that should have eggs at

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.360 
muscle I think that should have eggs at
least<00:03:53.610> 23<00:03:54.209> times

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
least 23 times

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.820 
least 23 times
three<00:03:56.370> times<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.700> week<00:03:56.959> even<00:03:57.959> Gary<00:03:58.170> products<00:03:58.680> as

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
three times a week even Gary products as

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.990 
three times a week even Gary products as
well<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.490> I<00:04:00.230> put<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.290> over<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:04.910> think<00:04:05.910> my

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
well so I put that over I think my

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.309 
well so I put that over I think my
burger<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.450> done<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:06.900> I'm<00:04:06.959> going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.170> take<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
burger is done so I'm going to take that

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.530 
burger is done so I'm going to take that
burger<00:04:07.770> there<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.490> put<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.270> over<00:04:09.450> here<00:04:10.310> on

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
burger there and put that over here on

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.260 
burger there and put that over here on
to<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.890> looks<00:04:13.890> pretty<00:04:14.160> nasty<00:04:14.400> with<00:04:14.880> all<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
to the looks pretty nasty with all the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.569 
to the looks pretty nasty with all the
egg<00:04:15.510> pieces<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.139> D<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.370> looks<00:04:17.489> pretty

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
egg pieces on D and it looks pretty

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.280 
egg pieces on D and it looks pretty
nasty<00:04:17.880> buddy<00:04:18.269> hey<00:04:18.930> listen<00:04:19.730> doesn't<00:04:20.730> matter

it's<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.470> about<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.710> proteins<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
it's all about the proteins and the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.290 
it's all about the proteins and the
nutrients<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.600> I'm<00:04:24.720> getting<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:26.240> what<00:04:27.240> I

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.620 
nutrients that I'm getting and what I
like<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.570> do<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.870> add<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> bit<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.370> black<00:04:29.370> pepper

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
like to do is add a bit of black pepper

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.650 
like to do is add a bit of black pepper
on<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.980> eggs<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.610> like<00:04:33.000> black<00:04:33.180> pepper<00:04:33.480> on

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
on to the eggs I like black pepper on

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.400 
on to the eggs I like black pepper on
everything<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:36.120> what<00:04:36.330> we<00:04:36.690> got<00:04:36.810> about<00:04:37.020> 20

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
everything so what we got about 20

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.460 
everything so what we got about 20
probably<00:04:38.280> 20<00:04:38.730> grams<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.180> protein<00:04:39.390> in<00:04:39.840> this

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
probably 20 grams of protein in this

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.070 
probably 20 grams of protein in this
burger<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.300> each<00:04:42.300> egg<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.840> believe<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.380> what

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
burger and each egg I believe is what

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:56.440 
burger and each egg I believe is what
hey<00:04:46.080> guys<00:04:51.350> each<00:04:52.350> egg<00:04:52.710> has<00:04:53.100> what<00:04:53.820> each<00:04:54.540> egg<00:04:54.840> has

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
hey guys each egg has what each egg has

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.240 
hey guys each egg has what each egg has
seven<00:04:57.450> grams<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:58.080> protein<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.310> all<00:05:00.240> together

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
seven grams of protein so all together

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.400 
seven grams of protein so all together
I'm<00:05:02.250> having<00:05:02.910> close<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.300> 40<00:05:03.630> grams<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:04.169> protein

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
I'm having close to 40 grams of protein

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.020 
I'm having close to 40 grams of protein
in<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.729> meal<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:07.370> hopefully<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.490> carbs<00:05:08.850> from

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
in this meal so hopefully the carbs from

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.640 
in this meal so hopefully the carbs from
the<00:05:09.210> bread<00:05:09.419> will<00:05:09.600> give<00:05:09.750> me<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.870> energy<00:05:10.080> for

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
the bread will give me the energy for

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.290 
the bread will give me the energy for
running<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.370> doing<00:05:11.850> some<00:05:12.090> weightlifting

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
running and doing some weightlifting

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.250 
running and doing some weightlifting
later<00:05:13.200> on<00:05:13.380> today<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.570> usually<00:05:15.570> if<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:16.020> have

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
later on today and usually if I have

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.100 
later on today and usually if I have
this<00:05:16.440> type<00:05:16.650> of<00:05:16.680> meal<00:05:17.010> before<00:05:17.550> i<00:05:17.900> work<00:05:18.900> out

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
this type of meal before i work out

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.110 
this type of meal before i work out
after<00:05:19.169> i<00:05:19.680> work<00:05:19.740> out<00:05:20.010> i<00:05:20.070> won't<00:05:20.370> have<00:05:20.580> another

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
after i work out i won't have another

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.760 
after i work out i won't have another
big<00:05:21.360> meal<00:05:21.600> what<00:05:21.810> I'll<00:05:21.900> usually<00:05:22.050> have<00:05:22.260> is<00:05:22.590> just
