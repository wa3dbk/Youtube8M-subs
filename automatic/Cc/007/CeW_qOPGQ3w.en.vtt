00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.160
 hey people we are here today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.259
 in front of the building of the company paints advertising 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.950
 because I want my sun shades 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.440
 to print 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 Here's a nice greeting 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.759
 to austria to the photographer 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 matthias schweighÃ¶fer the before a few 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.300
 Weeks already uploaded a video 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 showed how he basked his sun 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 are printed and that was one 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 inspiration for me too 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.859
 if that 's easy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.539
 incredible advertising effect and how that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.080
 whole works look us now 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.560
 more exactly 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.560
 With 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.780
 we'll try this sun visor here 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
 to stick on it means to be years old 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.300
 It takes over I watch and I watch 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190
 will perhaps a bit 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.230
 assist 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.830
 what kind of a film of that is 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.570
 pressed which is a digital templates 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.910
 foil the insolvency proceedings directly 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 can be printed 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.750
 special foil the artist 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.310
 very halting is that I see the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 pressure through the coal 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.230
 after officers no longer stand alone 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.400
 one dissolves long before the attacks 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.170
 it is just important that they are important 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.270
 about west fire what kind of scope 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.590
 So the iris has a bit of a can 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.890
 The film then a bit 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.010
 that maybe he has a margin 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.210
 but has been reasonably accurate one 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.930
 have still more fun to it all at 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.930
 comfortable 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.040
 so we are finished we have two 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.970
 sun send sunshine times stuck 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.120
 I would say she has that very well 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.500
 so made my logo so chic 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.720
 on it my name with internet address and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 how can you just send here now 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.870
 and again collectively sit on and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.600
 then you are definitely one 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.120
 flashy photographer so if you're at 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.780
