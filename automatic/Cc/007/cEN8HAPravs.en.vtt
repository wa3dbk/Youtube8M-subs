all of that I would suggest he might

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.939 
all of that I would suggest he might
still<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.390> showing<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:18.930> ill<00:00:19.140> effects<00:00:21.949> up

there to the midsection of humongous and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.290 
there to the midsection of humongous and
a<00:00:26.640> flurry<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.119> uppercuts<00:00:28.880> Nunda<00:00:29.880> slightly

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.819 
blocked him
and<00:00:32.969> raining<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:33.719> blows<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> back<00:00:34.649> of

Mendoza<00:00:39.079> mongers<00:00:40.079> finally<00:00:40.469> escapes<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
Mendoza mongers finally escapes from the

the<00:00:44.370> top<00:00:44.579> rope<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.550> humongous<00:00:48.360> was

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the top rope and I think humongous was

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
the top rope and I think humongous was
able<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:48.899> his<00:00:49.110> considerable<00:00:49.320> girth<00:00:50.180> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
able to use his considerable girth to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
able to use his considerable girth to
see<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.780> he<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:51.930> doing<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> referee

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
see what he was doing from the referee

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
see what he was doing from the referee

and delivery had seen that he would

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
and delivery had seen that he would
quite<00:00:54.510> possibly<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.649> received<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> public

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
quite possibly have received a public

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.640 
quite possibly have received a public

humongous using his considerable size

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.940 
humongous using his considerable size
advantage<00:01:09.070> over<00:01:10.070> Mikey<00:01:10.640> Mendoza
