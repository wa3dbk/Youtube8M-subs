was<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> Wisconsin<00:00:23.369> v4<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.320> they<00:00:25.320> pulled<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
was a Wisconsin v4 and they pulled it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.169 
was a Wisconsin v4 and they pulled it
out<00:00:25.890> finding<00:00:26.430> parts<00:00:26.869> to<00:00:27.869> rebuild<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.179> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
out finding parts to rebuild it and but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.519 
out finding parts to rebuild it and but
I<00:00:30.210> did<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> use<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.170> around<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I did want to use it just around the

I did want to use it just around the
house<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.329> we<00:00:33.329> bought<00:00:33.899> another<00:00:34.110> Bobcat

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
house here we bought another Bobcat

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.560 
house here we bought another Bobcat
replace<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> farm<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.140> installed<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
replace it for the farm so I installed a

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.799 
replace it for the farm so I installed a
16<00:00:39.570> horsepower<00:00:40.850> engine<00:00:41.850> off<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> starting

16 horsepower engine off of a starting
unit<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.260> bought<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.649> auction<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.219> $65

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
unit that I bought at auction for $65

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
unit that I bought at auction for $65
we<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.469> underpowered<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> works<00:00:47.430> for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
we don't underpowered but it works for

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.580 
we don't underpowered but it works for
what<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> need<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.809> still<00:00:49.289> lifts

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
what I need here actually still lifts

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
what I need here actually still lifts
about<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> same<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> I'll<00:00:51.750> show<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
about the same and I'll show you the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
about the same and I'll show you the
engine<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.090> had<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.360> some

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
engine here had to make some

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.979 
engine here had to make some
modifications<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> work<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.989> built

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
modifications to get it to work I built

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.310 
modifications to get it to work I built
special<00:00:58.829> mounting<00:00:59.190> plate<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.989> couldn't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
special mounting plate and I couldn't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
special mounting plate and I couldn't
use<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.469> automatic<00:01:01.949> she'd<00:01:02.370> clutch<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
use the automatic she'd clutch on this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.690 
use the automatic she'd clutch on this
one<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> took<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.930> snowmobile<00:01:04.589> clutch<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
one so I took a snowmobile clutch the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.200 
one so I took a snowmobile clutch the
secondary<00:01:06.299> machined<00:01:07.140> fitting<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
secondary machined fitting for it and I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.429 
secondary machined fitting for it and I
just<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> gear<00:01:10.439> range<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
just at the gear range that I want and

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.300 
just at the gear range that I want and
works<00:01:13.439> pretty<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> stuff<00:01:16.619> originally

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
works pretty good and stuff originally

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
works pretty good and stuff originally
this<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> had<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> variable<00:01:18.659> sheave<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this one had a variable sheave in it so

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.730 
this one had a variable sheave in it so
you<00:01:19.439> could<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.740> different<00:01:20.119> speed<00:01:21.119> ranges

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
you could get different speed ranges

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
you could get different speed ranges
these<00:01:22.740> old<00:01:22.950> bobcats<00:01:24.200> they<00:01:25.200> basically<00:01:26.509> worked

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
these old bobcats they basically worked

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.960 
these old bobcats they basically worked
as<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> direct<00:01:28.500> drive<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> snowmobile<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
as a direct drive like a snowmobile and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.719 
as a direct drive like a snowmobile and
then<00:01:30.150> everything<00:01:30.540> else<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.930> hydraulics

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
then everything else was hydraulics

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.660 
then everything else was hydraulics
later<00:01:32.729> skid<00:01:33.119> loaders<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.750> hydraulic<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
later skid loaders are all hydraulic so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179 
later skid loaders are all hydraulic so
you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.570> there's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> clutch

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you can see down here there's the clutch

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.969 
you can see down here there's the clutch
part<00:01:38.549> machine<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.210> halves<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> drop<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
part machine the two halves and drop the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.550 
part machine the two halves and drop the
belt<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> lower<00:01:41.939> gear<00:01:42.060> range<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
belt down to a lower gear range that it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100 
belt down to a lower gear range that it
works<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.479> parts<00:01:45.810> because<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
works and to I get parts because the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.910 
works and to I get parts because the
other<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.439> whoops

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
other one whoops

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.200 
other one whoops
overhauled<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.990> stuff<00:01:49.790> got<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> separate

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
overhauled and stuff got a separate

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910 
overhauled and stuff got a separate
little<00:01:51.360> gas<00:01:51.659> tank<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> feed<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
little gas tank up here to feed it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.950 
little gas tank up here to feed it
because<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.700> pump<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> strong

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
because the pump on this one is strong

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.639 
because the pump on this one is strong
enough<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> draw<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> fuel<00:01:55.920> tank<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:57.649> we'll

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
enough to draw out a fuel tank but we'll

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.730 
enough to draw out a fuel tank but we'll
start<00:01:59.009> er<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.159> once<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.380> they<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
start er up once here and they get this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.230 
start er up once here and they get this
over<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:03.950> alright<00:02:04.950> got<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.310> custom<00:02:05.759> starting

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
over here alright got my custom starting

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
here

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
here
it's<00:02:07.020> throttle<00:02:07.500> set

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it's throttle set

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:24.770 
it's throttle set
for<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> coke

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.540 

I<00:02:29.450> also<00:02:30.450> installed<00:02:31.110> another<00:02:31.530> hydraulic<00:02:32.280> pump

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
I also installed another hydraulic pump

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.440 
I also installed another hydraulic pump
to<00:02:32.730> run<00:02:32.910> autumn<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.300> draw
