00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.210
 hi guys how are you and ramÃ³n sutep 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.730
 and today I'm going to present my first one 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.440
 boxing that what you see the truth that 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.580
 I did not plan to do a boxing I'm not 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.680
 a lot of boxing you can see 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.139
 so far I have not done any but I 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.029
 You told me what is twitter and 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.579
 facebook today to the morning when I put my 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.619
 acquisition then good if we 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:26.989
 you ask it logically I'm going to do it 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.089
 which is here I have the milestone 4 edition 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.220
 limited well me in principle 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.290
 I'm going to recognize him I wanted to buy the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.990
 normal what happens that in the store in 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.490
 the one that I normally bought there was no 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.020
 normal only this was the edition 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.120
 limited as I said at least we're going to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.190
 buying it cost me a little bit more but not 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.810
 nothing happens, nothing happens, everything is everything 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.070
 be to try new things like the 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.900
 halo that does not play a lot 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.090
 So, well, I'm going to do it in a boxing 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.440
 and as I say the first one that I do already 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.300
 see how long it takes for this look or if I'm going to 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.170
 lower the camera a little so that it 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 see let's see 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.609
 and I guess there is to see a little more and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.650
 there it goes perfectly well here you have it 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.140
 I'm going to go up a little bit 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.110
 because here it looks better perfect let's go 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.170
 there with careful because this 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.780
 Being a collector's edition, he wants to 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.119
 try there is and save it 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.250
 as much as possible outside 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.350
 little plastiquito the first thing that the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 truth that is the box is a joy 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.380
 look here has what a chapita is 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.140

 I'm here to take a look that more 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.069
 bring another sachet more now that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.069
 open it 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.069

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.080

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.810
 electromagnetic gun the rifle 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.640
 battle was not your national what good 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.710
 it's good that it came back here good 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.850
 summary of the game sessions of 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:13.330
 perfect war and I'm still looking 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.130
 but found this on the network 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.910
 if she 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.830
 was the one that put the engines to this 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.810
 thing the letter has to be addressed to 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:28.540
 she does not hear or look there she comes and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.520
 Behind a letter comes a message 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.950
 well perfect that has already shown 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.180
 out there and the truth had where to know 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.540
 that are our men but good 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.040
 first in plays quoted here you see 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.740
 metallic that painted look guys 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.830
 first disk 1 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.730
 and disk 2 does not specify what it is 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.410
 each one but good guess the best 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.540
 is not for multiplayer like the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.480
 butterfield 1 for multiplayer and other 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.910
 for to have nothing else the box is 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.620
 fantastic and another for story mode 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.940
 let's open what are the sachets 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.550
 these to see what we put here 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:15.600
 well this one here is the code 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.090
 a code that unlocks the access of 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.860
 limited edition download advance of 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.120

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.410
 you see but I already have it bundled here 14 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:34.380
 free days of goal 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.210

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.760
 next I overlap the silver 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.990
 any fear gives me earlier here 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.860
 this is the same as if we were to open 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.860
 the soup envelopes 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.580

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.820
 if it was the mission, what good guys like 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.539
 if it was a mission spartan attention 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.520
 gabrielsson majestic assault team 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.500

 Take a look at the game box 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.039
 as you see here a book in which he speaks 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.229
 of the operations there will be the weapons of 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.810
 all guys but nothing else the following 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.120
 try the game and have possibly 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.270
 go to do a section that is titled 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.800
 playing with subscribers you have to 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.930
 pay attention and I also want 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.270

 I have not played for a long time 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.069
