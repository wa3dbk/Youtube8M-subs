out I don't usually do them cuz I can

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.610 
out I don't usually do them cuz I can
find<00:00:06.450> them<00:00:06.569> kind<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.810> useless<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> racing

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980 
challenge is going to be to if you know
these<00:00:17.400> salt-flat<00:00:17.910> they're<00:00:18.480> not<00:00:18.570> really<00:00:18.720> salt

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
these salt-flat they're not really salt

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.870 
these salt-flat they're not really salt
flats<00:00:19.199> but<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:20.160> thing<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> bottom

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
flats but like this thing at the bottom

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.929 
flats but like this thing at the bottom
of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> riverbed<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.930> want<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> see<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.730> type

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
of the riverbed I want to see what type

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.970 
of the riverbed I want to see what type
of<00:00:24.119> speed<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.689> achieve<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
of speed we can achieve here and then I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
of speed we can achieve here and then I
want<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> challenge<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.029> guys<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
see if you can beat my top speed so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:49.190 
see if you can beat my top speed so
let's<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:46.820> alright<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.030> I'm<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.660> start

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
let's go alright so I'm going to start

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
let's go alright so I'm going to start
this<00:00:49.350> off<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.100> benchmark<00:00:50.579> basically<00:00:51.090> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
this off or my benchmark basically is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.090 
this off or my benchmark basically is
going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> Veyron<00:00:52.410> SS<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
going to be with the Veyron SS this is a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be with the Veyron SS this is a
completely<00:00:53.489> stock<00:00:53.730> Veyron<00:00:54.090> SS<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.710> let's<00:00:55.710> see

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
completely stock Veyron SS and let's see

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
completely stock Veyron SS and let's see
what<00:00:56.160> type<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.340> speed<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.120> we've<00:00:57.239> got

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
what type of speed we can get we've got

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.330 
what type of speed we can get we've got
some<00:00:57.510> traffic<00:00:57.899> down<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> quite

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
some traffic down here which is quite

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
some traffic down here which is quite
surprised<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.750> guess<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.230> aren't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
surprised i I really guess these aren't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.579 
surprised i I really guess these aren't
salt<00:01:01.739> flats<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:03.270> there's<00:01:04.080> water<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
salt flats just because there's water in

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
salt flats just because there's water in
them<00:01:04.769> which<00:01:05.450> science<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.689> doesn't<00:01:06.990> really

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
them which science that doesn't really

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.969 
them which science that doesn't really
work<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> anyways<00:01:08.630> let's<00:01:09.630> head<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.560> see

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
work so anyways let's head up and see

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
work so anyways let's head up and see
I'm<00:01:11.130> already<00:01:11.310> getting<00:01:11.520> lost<00:01:11.729> alright<00:01:12.540> let's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I'm already getting lost alright let's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200 
I'm already getting lost alright let's
keep<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:13.680> eye<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.799> our<00:01:13.950> speed<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.150> we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
keep an eye on our speed and see what we

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
keep an eye on our speed and see what we
can<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> issue<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> thing<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
can do the issue with this thing is you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.050 
can do the issue with this thing is you
might<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.189> it'd<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.490> easy<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
might think it'd be really easy just to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
might think it'd be really easy just to
max<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.600> speed<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> issue<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.650> it's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
max your speed but the issue is it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.300 
max your speed but the issue is it's
bumpy<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:21.090> 210<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.439> also<00:01:22.650> has<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> curve

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
bumpy that's 210 and it also has a curve

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
bumpy that's 210 and it also has a curve
so<00:01:23.820> we'll<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.500> 217<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
so we'll see what we can do I got 217 I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
so we'll see what we can do I got 217 I
saw<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:27.840> faster<00:01:28.130> one

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
saw can I get a little bit faster one

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
saw can I get a little bit faster one
last<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.579> stray<00:01:29.880> pit<00:01:30.060> oh<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.450> nope<00:01:30.780> nope

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
last little stray pit oh no nope nope

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.890 
last little stray pit oh no nope nope
nope<00:01:31.380> nope<00:01:31.710> alright

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
nope nope alright

nope nope alright
so<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.229> our<00:01:34.320> benchmark<00:01:35.360> 217

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so that's gonna be our benchmark 217

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
so that's gonna be our benchmark 217
miles<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.810> hour<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:38.159> pretty<00:01:38.430> quick

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
miles an hour that's that's pretty quick

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700 
miles an hour that's that's pretty quick
alright<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.869> let's<00:01:40.049> head<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
alright so let's head back to the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.240 
alright so let's head back to the
festival<00:01:41.250> choose<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> car<00:01:42.390> build<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:44.159> if

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
festival choose a car build it up see if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
festival choose a car build it up see if
we<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.460> beat<00:01:44.579> 217<00:01:45.210> miles<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.479> hour<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.020> I'm

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
we can beat 217 miles an hour so I'm

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
we can beat 217 miles an hour so I'm
thinking<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.310> good<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> top

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
thinking what would be good to do a top

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.389 
thinking what would be good to do a top
that<00:01:49.350> would<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.070> we're<00:01:50.310> going

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that would be good because we're going

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
that would be good because we're going
to<00:01:50.460> need<00:01:50.579> four-wheel<00:01:51.030> drive<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.899> also<00:01:52.079> want

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to need four-wheel drive we also want

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.800 
to need four-wheel drive we also want
something<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:53.399> super<00:01:54.060> heavy<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.450> quite

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
something not super heavy but quite

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
something not super heavy but quite
heavy<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.350> keep<00:01:55.530> us<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.979> flat<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> level<00:01:56.759> as

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
heavy to keep us like flat and level as

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
heavy to keep us like flat and level as
much<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.290> dealing<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.950> those

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
much as we can so dealing with all those

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.880 
much as we can so dealing with all those
bumps<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.210> let's<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:00.990> our<00:02:01.020> options<00:02:01.229> are

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
bumps so let's see what our options are

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
bumps so let's see what our options are
alright<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.240> Koenigsegg

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
alright so I think that Koenigsegg

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.050 
alright so I think that Koenigsegg
wherever<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.409> will<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> quite<00:02:05.130> nicely

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
wherever it is will do quite nicely

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.330 
wherever it is will do quite nicely
I<00:02:06.090> reckon<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.320> try<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.530> GTR<00:02:07.979> too<00:02:08.129> though

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I reckon I would try the GTR too though

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.999 
I reckon I would try the GTR too though
if<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.720> guys<00:02:09.840> try<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> GTR<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
if I was you guys try the GTR too and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.199 
if I was you guys try the GTR too and
see<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.370> type<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> speed<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.060> get

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
see what type of speed you can get

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
see what type of speed you can get
because<00:02:12.540> we're<00:02:12.780> doing<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.050> top<00:02:13.200> speed<00:02:13.410> run

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
because we're doing a top speed run

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.540 
because we're doing a top speed run
essentially<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:15.180> need<00:02:15.210> power<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.560> max<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
essentially we need power so max that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
essentially we need power so max that
all<00:02:17.760> out<00:02:18.630> turbos<00:02:19.320> kick<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.860> holy<00:02:20.430> crap<00:02:21.300> that's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
all out turbos kick in holy crap that's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.990 
all out turbos kick in holy crap that's
a<00:02:21.780> lot<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.020> power<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:23.190> honestly<00:02:23.400> say<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
a lot of power I can honestly say I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.730 
a lot of power I can honestly say I
don't<00:02:24.240> think<00:02:24.540> I've<00:02:24.720> ever<00:02:24.750> seen<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.350> type<00:02:25.710> of

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
don't think I've ever seen that type of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.070 
don't think I've ever seen that type of
acceleration<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.730> launch<00:02:27.000> from<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.780> non

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
acceleration and launch from a non

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.930 
acceleration and launch from a non
all-wheel<00:02:28.530> drive<00:02:28.800> car<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.280> pretty<00:02:29.730> crate

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
all-wheel drive car that's pretty crate

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.800 
all-wheel drive car that's pretty crate
and<00:02:30.000> we're<00:02:30.120> gonna<00:02:30.210> be<00:02:30.390> making<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.750> thing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and we're gonna be making this thing

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.880 
and we're gonna be making this thing
all-wheel-drive<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
all-wheel-drive so

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.610 
all-wheel-drive so
oh<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.640> ruins<00:02:33.060> our<00:02:33.210> top<00:02:33.360> speed<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.440> will

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
oh that ruins our top speed but we will

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.920 
oh that ruins our top speed but we will
need<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.010> though<00:02:35.190> hmm<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.030> wonder<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.810> can

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
need it though hmm I wonder if we can

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.680 
need it though hmm I wonder if we can
fix<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.470> some<00:02:38.280> gear<00:02:38.790> een<00:02:38.970> we<00:02:39.480> probably

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
fix that with some gear een we probably

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.660 
fix that with some gear een we probably
can<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.230> want<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.830> launch<00:02:41.160> but<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> also

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
can I want to get that launch but I also

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.280 
can I want to get that launch but I also
want<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> weight<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.450> try<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.750> keep<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.050> don't

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
want the weight to try and keep I don't

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.740 
want the weight to try and keep I don't
know<00:02:43.680> hmm<00:02:44.430> maybe<00:02:44.880> some<00:02:45.090> experimenting<00:02:45.720> for

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
know hmm maybe some experimenting for

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.020 
know hmm maybe some experimenting for
that<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> future<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.980> need<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> do<00:02:47.490> forts<00:02:47.880> of

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
that in the future I need to do forts of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.220 
that in the future I need to do forts of
science<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.959> would<00:02:49.050> be<00:02:49.110> pretty

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
science that I think it would be pretty

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380 
science that I think it would be pretty
cool<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.620> what<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:50.280> actually<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.880> best<00:02:51.060> do

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
cool to see what is actually the best do

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.940 
cool to see what is actually the best do
you<00:02:51.480> want<00:02:51.720> more<00:02:51.900> weight<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.350> do<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> want<00:02:52.800> like

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
you want more weight or do you want like

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
you want more weight or do you want like
I<00:02:53.010> don't<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.520> wanted<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.510> wanted<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.780> see<00:02:54.870> if

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I don't know I wanted I wanted to see if

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
I don't know I wanted I wanted to see if
I<00:02:54.989> could<00:02:55.140> do<00:02:55.200> some<00:02:55.350> science<00:02:55.739> all<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I could do some science all right so the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.000 
I could do some science all right so the
tune<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.810> where<00:02:58.080> we<00:02:58.110> save<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.980> lot

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
tune is going to be where we save a lot

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.340 
tune is going to be where we save a lot
a<00:02:59.340> lot<00:02:59.700> let's<00:02:59.940> go<00:03:00.090> let's<00:03:00.690> go<00:03:00.840> lowest<00:03:01.230> tire

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
a lot let's go let's go lowest tire

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.540 
a lot let's go let's go lowest tire
pressure<00:03:01.560> because<00:03:01.770> we're<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.160> off-roading

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
pressure because we're going off-roading

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.370 
pressure because we're going off-roading
right<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.150> need<00:03:03.330> as<00:03:03.510> much<00:03:04.020> grip<00:03:04.230> as

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
right so we need as much grip as

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.860 
right so we need as much grip as
possible<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:04.980> as<00:03:05.400> for<00:03:05.700> our<00:03:05.790> top<00:03:05.970> wow<00:03:06.390> we<00:03:06.450> got<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
possible and as for our top wow we got a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
possible and as for our top wow we got a
lengthen<00:03:07.260> those<00:03:07.350> gears<00:03:07.620> up<00:03:07.860> all<00:03:08.190> right<00:03:08.280> so

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
lengthen those gears up all right so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.500 
lengthen those gears up all right so
let's<00:03:08.550> see<00:03:08.670> what<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:08.940> gives<00:03:09.180> us<00:03:09.360> with

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
let's see what it just gives us with

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.220 
let's see what it just gives us with

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
pretty decent I quite like those let's

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.970 
pretty decent I quite like those let's
just<00:03:23.220> maybe<00:03:23.400> bump<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.450> little<00:03:24.630> more<00:03:24.989> bump

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
just maybe bump it up a little more bump

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.220 
just maybe bump it up a little more bump
it<00:03:26.070> up<00:03:26.160> down<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.700> don't<00:03:26.880> know<00:03:26.970> words<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.690> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
it up down I don't know words and the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.289 
it up down I don't know words and the
ride<00:03:28.500> height<00:03:28.739> itself<00:03:29.130> max<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.030> out<00:03:30.150> because

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
ride height itself max that out because

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.509 
ride height itself max that out because
again<00:03:30.420> we're<00:03:30.690> off-roading<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.410> hey<00:03:31.860> let's<00:03:32.340> uh

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
again we're off-roading so hey let's uh

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.810 
again we're off-roading so hey let's uh
let's<00:03:32.760> do<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.120> diff<00:03:33.660> let's<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> sixty<00:03:35.549> or

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
let's do that diff let's get a sixty or

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.140 
let's do that diff let's get a sixty or
a<00:03:35.880> 4060<00:03:36.750> split<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.640> hopefully<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.760> goes<00:03:38.940> well

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
a 4060 split so hopefully this goes well

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.789 
a 4060 split so hopefully this goes well
all<00:03:39.480> right<00:03:39.750> little<00:03:39.959> Koenigsegg<00:03:40.410> what<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.709> my

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
all right little Koenigsegg what is my

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.020 
all right little Koenigsegg what is my

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
all right let's try me maybe going in

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.710 
all right let's try me maybe going in
the<00:04:29.370> other<00:04:29.520> direction<00:04:29.820> might<00:04:30.300> be<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.450> little

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the other direction might be a little

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.390 
the other direction might be a little
better<00:04:30.780> let's<00:04:31.110> try<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:31.440> all<00:04:31.860> right<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:32.220> I'm

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
better let's try that all right so I'm

better let's try that all right so I'm
thinking<00:04:32.970> if<00:04:33.150> we<00:04:33.990> start<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.800> around<00:04:35.100> here

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
thinking if we start like around here

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.409 
thinking if we start like around here
turn<00:04:37.169> we<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.470> get<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.889> corner<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.790> little

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
turn we can get the corner in a little

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.540 
turn we can get the corner in a little
bit<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.870> see<00:04:40.800> what<00:04:40.950> happens

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
bit and see what happens

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.090 
bit and see what happens
this<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.720> kind<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.229> a<00:04:43.260> salt<00:04:43.560> flat<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.919> don't

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100
