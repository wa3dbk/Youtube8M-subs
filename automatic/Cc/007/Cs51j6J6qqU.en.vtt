00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:11.000
 welcome all fellow in this video 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.139
 I want to voice my opinion amateur about 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.630
 choosing the first knife 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.170
 This is a video response for a blogger contest. 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.850
 girls about choosing a character like that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.550
 why why that what exactly folding 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 knives in question well I will not break 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 This tradition will firstly assume that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.410
 If you who are watching this Richie are looking for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.610
 advice about 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.620
 for 1 knife you are looking for advice on the internet with this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.570
 Were on you tuba then most likely you this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.879
 a knife is needed not for a coconut on a character 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.590
 activities not for some there 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 specific tasks 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 because otherwise you would have 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.850
 long ago where did you find that knife ? 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.390
 get to know you on duty this knife was 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.149
 first one can some work well if you 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 here you are looking for advice here on 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
 about your first knife means more 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.380
 all you need as a toy like 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.450
 some nice accessory and this is based on 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 from this i will voice my i have 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.390
 I think that when choosing 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.299
 Well, as I tell you how I acted for 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159
 he answered everything very much when he bought 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.250
 by your first folding knife just two 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.000
 things just two things first to me 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.189
 it seems that you do not need to pay attention 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 it is on the stage of the knife between not get to 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.399
 pay attention and listen to advice on 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.640
 about the fact that let's say people say 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.579
 what better to buy an inexpensive knife first 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.680
 look around look around there take a look 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 I had to listen for a while and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.630
 then remembered that for actually 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.380
 I was filmed I think that for anyone 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.920
 human 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.710
 choose your Peron I do not need 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 be guided by the price if you are 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.330
 buy money if you have the opportunity 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.300
 buy a knife for 300 dollars buy yourself 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.550
 is the current one hundred times if not 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.300
 opportunities well of course you need to start from 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.880
 budget but not guided if you 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.930
 there is a knife that does not like you see 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.690
 but it is expensive only to buy 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 from this comes the first thing you need 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.989
 to navigate it naturally of course 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.819
 This is advice from the captain but not 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.830
 less this is a visual external 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.599
 attractiveness 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.190
 Ruslan is the same I myself if you look like a knife 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.239
 like you have money for him 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.680
 no matter how much you buy 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.180
 if you buy cheap legs from you 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.180
 disappoint some moment you will not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.660
 sorry and small if you buy 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.790
 expensive knife or disappoint expensive knife 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.930
 for three hundred and four hundred can always 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.060
 create some minimal losses 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.150
 expensive knives are not always sold 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.760
 bought this is no problem but i can 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.870
 you can say 90 percent you can 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.430
 make sure that if you buy a knife 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.620
 guided simply from no matter what 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.870
 steel is not on the material of the handle on 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.980
 money but only guided externally 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.049
 attractive 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.819
 then 1 there a couple of months i'm exactly to protect 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.859
 towers 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.400
 if you are already on something deeper 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:44.579
 delve then maybe you 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.870
 want something different this dear 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.829
 let's say you can always 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.139
 getting rid is pretty profitable but cheap 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.120
 leave yourself as a memory or too 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.659
 In principle, I can do this too 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.190
 my first folding knife 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.599
 we just had some kind of budget 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.430
 determine the territory for yourself 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.330
 completely small addition of 15 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.379
 dollars i bought this knife which is me 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.940
 liked visually and you know 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.670
 has been more than a year or so is not 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.799
 fed up i still like the food and 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.419
 departures rarely wear rarely carry just 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.510
 because there is no clip 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.889
 thats the only thing that seems to be a lack 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.930
 not even that no no one-handed 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.539
 the opening is just no blind 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:38.680
 and so the wrong knife is still afraid he's not 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:40.810
 pleases this knife so far so far 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.580
 bit sorry that did not buy no matter 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.050
 on which 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.490
 steel there this is the first thing you need 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.600
 pay attention is love from the first 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.410
 glance and second you have to answer 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.560
 question how much time will you be 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.260
 want to 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.930
 whether we are as long as you want 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:07.270
 I push into the subject, that is, if you donâ€™t 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.700
 do you want so much do not want to delve 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.320
 delve into sharpening 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.090
 some serious knife care 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.560
 knife disassembly of course then costs 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.229
 still pay attention to some 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.669
 cheaper steel 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.789
 which can just be a misfortune to correct 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.720
 and all and on some simple type locks 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.930
 here is la mirada 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:34.990
 here it is the knife to which 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:39.789
 need to pay attention to at least some 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.410
 unpretentious if you want the future 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.030
 or now when you buy your 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.669
 you can't buy the first knife 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.960
 some kind of sharpener more or less in summer 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.949
 water stones wherever you want with time 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.580
 spend time studying there 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.610
 magic sharpening on water stones 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:04.300
 the behavior of the cutting edge faces 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.099
 the sharpness of the laser sword there of course then 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.000
 you can still pay attention to 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.360
 some more expensive knives were 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.930
 expensive 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:19.210
 correspondingly more complex processing 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:23.800
 become dear meetings feel yourself 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:27.070
 forces that you can make out a knife not 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.020
 the killer is the case you want to learn 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.820
 there to look after him and here to sort out 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.080
 of course with the further can be turned 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.669
 monino more difficult some 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.039
 constructions if not then something 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.070
 idle time here for more seriously on life 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:47.849
 more serious and Stalin certainly not 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.599
 more expensive then it goes without saying 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:52.150
 almost now I think you need 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.830
 ask at the beginning then it may already be 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:58.449
 some other nuances there some there 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.780
 subtleties but for the first knife I think 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:04.540
 two points is enough love with 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:08.320
 at a glance it is 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:12.130
 what time is the day 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.230
 want to spend time among 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:18.710
 answer these two questions you are very 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:22.520
 easily get out of the whole set 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:25.280
 which is basically all I wanted 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.180
 say therefore thank you all for 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.870
 you are for watching my videos 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:38.740
 thanks to everyone and the video I watch who writes 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.740
 me in general, thank you all for new meetings
