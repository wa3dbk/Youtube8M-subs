glad<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.290> and<00:00:23.439> blow<00:00:23.680> up<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.590> looks<00:00:26.740> like

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
glad it and blow up but it looks like

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.260 
glad it and blow up but it looks like

Brown<00:00:42.940> is<00:00:43.149> low<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:43.390> they<00:00:43.690> are<00:00:43.780> much<00:00:43.960> faster<00:00:44.230> as

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
Brown is low so they are much faster as

upgraded<00:01:02.020> this<00:01:02.140> should<00:01:02.440> climb<00:01:02.800> very<00:01:03.220> much

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
upgraded this should climb very much

better<00:01:04.770> there's<00:01:05.770> also<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:06.040> glitch<00:01:06.310> on<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
gears not going up right away so you'll

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.710 
gears not going up right away so you'll
have<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.829> do<00:01:09.040> those<00:01:09.280> by<00:01:09.790> yourself<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.570> dev

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720

thing is looking pretty sexy it's a

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.499 
thing is looking pretty sexy it's a
level<00:01:17.829> 14<00:01:18.429> plane<00:01:18.850> that'll<00:01:19.299> be<00:01:19.359> interesting

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
level 14 plane that'll be interesting

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.200 
level 14 plane that'll be interesting
playing<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.560> whether<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.609> will<00:01:21.759> be<00:01:21.909> as

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
playing that whether that will be as

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.789 
playing that whether that will be as
effective<00:01:23.039> at<00:01:24.039> that<00:01:24.399> tier<00:01:24.759> or<00:01:24.789> not<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:26.530> pretty

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
effective at that tier or not I'm pretty

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.749 
effective at that tier or not I'm pretty
sure<00:01:26.890> they're<00:01:27.009> going<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.189> keep<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.429> there<00:01:27.609> just

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
sure they're going to keep it there just

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.080 
sure they're going to keep it there just
because<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.149> climb<00:01:28.390> rate<00:01:28.420> as<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:30.310> cockpit<00:01:30.880> if

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
because the climb rate as for cockpit if

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.239 
because the climb rate as for cockpit if
you<00:01:31.569> are<00:01:31.869> going<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.439> be<00:01:32.560> flying<00:01:32.799> in<00:01:33.159> the

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
you are going to be flying in the

you are going to be flying in the
cockpit<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.880> does<00:01:34.060> have<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.859> it<00:01:35.859> kind<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.219> seems

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
cockpit it does have a it kind of seems

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.910 
cockpit it does have a it kind of seems
like<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.609> dark<00:01:37.139> cockpit<00:01:38.139> so<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.439> will<00:01:38.560> be<00:01:38.590> tough

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
like a dark cockpit so it will be tough

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.840 
like a dark cockpit so it will be tough
to<00:01:38.979> see<00:01:39.569> all<00:01:40.569> your<00:01:40.780> dials<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:42.340> could<00:01:42.579> also<00:01:42.700> be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
to see all your dials it could also be

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.989 
to see all your dials it could also be
just<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.240> lighting<00:01:43.450> as<00:01:43.929> far<00:01:44.740> as<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.459> game<00:01:45.700> is

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
just the lighting as far as the game is

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.859 
just the lighting as far as the game is
concerned<00:01:47.159> there's<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.249> sundown<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.719> may

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
concerned there's a sundown so that may

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.550 
concerned there's a sundown so that may
be<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.049> issue<00:01:50.609> but<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:53.259> pretty

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
be the issue but it is a very pretty

be the issue but it is a very pretty
cockpit<00:01:54.069> otherwise<00:01:54.429> it<00:01:54.759> has<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.999> nice<00:01:55.329> bubble

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
burst button previous patches remember

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.690 
burst button previous patches remember
that<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.820> did<00:02:19.000> take<00:02:19.830> approximately<00:02:20.830> six<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
that it did take approximately six to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.320 
that it did take approximately six to
nine<00:02:21.970> bursts<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:23.290> kill<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> plane<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:25.120> seems

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
nine bursts to kill a plane and it seems

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.410 
nine bursts to kill a plane and it seems
like<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.660> has<00:02:25.840> been<00:02:25.990> cut<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.350> half<00:02:26.380> which<00:02:27.010> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
like that has been cut in half which is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.350 
like that has been cut in half which is
quite<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> bit<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.990> take<00:02:29.260> as<00:02:30.100> opposed<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> six<00:02:31.209> to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
quite a bit to take as opposed to six to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.540 
quite a bit to take as opposed to six to
nine<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:32.290> been<00:02:32.500> taking<00:02:32.920> more<00:02:33.220> along<00:02:33.520> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
nine it's been taking more along the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.470 
nine it's been taking more along the
lines<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.380> three<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.500> six<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.340> that's<00:02:36.610> that's<00:02:37.300> a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
lines of three to six so that's that's a

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.220 
lines of three to six so that's that's a
big<00:02:37.660> difference<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.709> honestly<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.580> mean<00:02:40.230> when

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
big difference in honestly I mean when

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.780 
big difference in honestly I mean when
you<00:02:41.350> look<00:02:41.530> at<00:02:41.709> your<00:02:41.800> plane<00:02:42.100> actually<00:02:42.459> getting

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
you look at your plane actually getting

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.360 
you look at your plane actually getting
hit<00:02:43.030> by<00:02:43.060> bees<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:44.320> look<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.650> actually<00:02:45.010> what

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
hit by bees just look at actually what

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.070 
hit by bees just look at actually what
damage<00:02:45.790> happens<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.450> plane<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.900> how<00:02:47.020> that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
damage happens the plane and how that

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.530 
damage happens the plane and how that
damage<00:02:47.590> affects<00:02:47.920> how<00:02:48.130> you're<00:02:48.310> flying<00:02:48.610> it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
damage affects how you're flying it's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.570 
damage affects how you're flying it's
changed<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.170> lot<00:02:50.350> in<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.560> regard<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.130> well<00:02:51.310> so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
changed a lot in that regard as well so

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.580 
changed a lot in that regard as well so
if<00:02:51.640> you're<00:02:51.760> getting<00:02:51.850> hit<00:02:52.209> by<00:02:52.239> these<00:02:52.600> you're

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
if you're getting hit by these you're

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.850 
if you're getting hit by these you're
going<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.770> end<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.070> with<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> lot<00:02:54.640> more<00:02:55.860> hits

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
going to end up with a lot more hits

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.750 
going to end up with a lot more hits
where<00:02:57.220> you're<00:02:57.430> getting

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
where you're getting

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.970 
where you're getting
critical<00:02:59.629> where<00:03:00.049> you're<00:03:00.200> getting<00:03:00.409> wings<00:03:00.739> that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
critical where you're getting wings that

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.220 
critical where you're getting wings that
are<00:03:01.040> black<00:03:01.400> red<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.659> are<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:02.989> really

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
are black red that are just really

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.800 
are black red that are just really
affecting<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.769> plan<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.629> that's<00:03:05.629> what<00:03:05.780> I

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
affecting the plan and that's what I

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.960 
affecting the plan and that's what I
like<00:03:06.019> about<00:03:06.049> these<00:03:06.409> fifties<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.280> that's<00:03:07.819> why

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
like about these fifties and that's why

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.250 
like about these fifties and that's why
I<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.120> about<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.720> fact<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.019> they're

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
I like about the fact that they're

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.399 
I like about the fact that they're
really<00:03:09.650> improving<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.549> things<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:11.060> were

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
really improving the things that were

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.809 
really improving the things that were
lackluster<00:03:12.409> in<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:12.980> game<00:03:13.189> the<00:03:13.459> one<00:03:13.610> thing

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
lackluster in the game the one thing

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.369 
lackluster in the game the one thing
that<00:03:13.849> they<00:03:14.090> really<00:03:14.360> need<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.540> improve<00:03:14.989> as<00:03:15.230> I've

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
that they really need to improve as I've

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.440 
that they really need to improve as I've
said<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.709> previous<00:03:15.920> videos<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.579> just<00:03:16.819> add<00:03:17.120> a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
said in previous videos to just add a

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.300 
said in previous videos to just add a
couple<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.110> top-tier<00:03:18.530> plants<00:03:18.950> both<00:03:19.190> the

leveled<00:03:21.379> out<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.829> this<00:03:22.459> game<00:03:22.670> will<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:22.970> elite

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
leveled out and this game will be elite
