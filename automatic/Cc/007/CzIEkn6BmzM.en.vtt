bad<00:00:40.739> tight<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.309> thought<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> wouldn't<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739

bad tight I thought I wouldn't use that
but<00:00:43.739> yeah<00:00:43.860> that's<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.699> time<00:00:44.790> when

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
made that because I know a little cheap

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
made that because I know a little cheap
trick<00:01:17.130> okay<00:01:17.580> no<00:01:18.300> little<00:01:18.570> cheap<00:01:18.780> trick<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:20.450> like

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
trick okay no little cheap trick so like

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
trick okay no little cheap trick so like
obviously<00:01:21.870> happens<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> Stephanie<00:01:22.950> keep<00:01:23.130> on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
obviously happens and Stephanie keep on

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.750 
obviously happens and Stephanie keep on
running<00:01:23.610> stuff<00:01:24.510> but<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.370> look<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.640> these

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
running stuff but if you look at these

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.700 
running stuff but if you look at these
stripes<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.110> actually<00:01:28.230> kind<00:01:28.620> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
stripes here you can actually kind of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640 
stripes here you can actually kind of
glitch<00:01:29.010> them<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.550> not<00:01:30.360> glitch<00:01:30.600> them<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
glitch them in a way not glitch them it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
glitch them in a way not glitch them it
is<00:01:32.130> tactic<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.800> you<00:01:35.460> were<00:01:35.670> if

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
is tactic so basically if you were if

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
is tactic so basically if you were if
you<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:37.020> they're<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.590> activate

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you look right they're gonna activate

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.810 
you look right they're gonna activate
gonna<00:01:38.370> play<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.850> told<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> call<00:01:39.360> ah<00:01:39.980> noob<00:01:40.980> right

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
gonna play I told you call ah noob right

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.740 
gonna play I told you call ah noob right
so<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.870> it<00:01:43.050> activates<00:01:43.409> from<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:44.750> OOP

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so I think it activates from there OOP

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.340 
so I think it activates from there OOP
put<00:01:46.650> okay<00:01:47.370> oh<00:01:47.550> you<00:01:47.850> tried<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.420> oh<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.050> tried

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
put okay oh you tried to it oh you tried

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.680 
put okay oh you tried to it oh you tried
for<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.950> basically<00:01:50.400> um<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.330> gonna<00:01:51.510> do

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
for so basically um are you gonna do

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.450 
for so basically um are you gonna do
really<00:01:51.930> survive<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.830> with<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> stress<00:01:53.310> i

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
