00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello how good this video is 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.050
 I will show how to install themes to your 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.110
 windows 7 I leave links in the description 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.599
 let's start then once downloaded the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.830
 universal temp yesterday will be this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.779
 folder unpacked already obviously 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.539
 then here they choose the installer 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.330
 depending on your operating system to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.050
 those that have 32-bit systems 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 they choose the one that says x86 for those who 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 have 64 bit systems like in my 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.940
 case we choose the one that says x 64 we give 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 right click run as administrator 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.809
 then click ok on the next 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.399
 window we give yes and in the next 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.430
 we will click on each of those three 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.310
 options in patch 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.340
 when they finish they should be like this 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.890
 it appears to me once done that must 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.070
 restart the computer this for 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.740
 applying those changes to the system is not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.880
 worry this will not harm it or put it 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.160
 slow etcetera etcetera is simply 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.370
 to give the permissions to apply themes 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.580
 made by third parties 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.780
 after having restarted it they look for their 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.780
 third-party topics 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.909
 in the folder they have them there must be 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 minimum these two files 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.260
 to those files they get copied 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.750
 now here pay attention we are going to 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 local disk c 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.940
 windows 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.940
 we look for the folder that says re source 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.750
 we go to the folder of topics and here 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.860
 we simply paste the two files that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.860
 we had copied 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 he will ask us for permission we give him 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.220
 continue and ready 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.019
 after doing this we can go 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.790
 to the desktop click right 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.659
 customize and in the list of topics 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.329
 what we have 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.870
 we look for the one that we have just gotten into 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.459
 the themes folder we select and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.459
 we wait for it to be applied 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.130
 as you can see now and in return the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
 appearance 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.650
 right now you will see that it is not only color in 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.630
 windows and taskbars the menu 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.950
 start and font colors 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.950
 they are also modified 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.250
 well that has been everything I leave you there 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.379
 another sample of subjects also if they want 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.689
 You can find another video in which 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.989
 I explain how to change the button's icon 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.569
 I hope I have served you and if you 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.310
 liked leave a like and comment what they 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.310
 it seemed thanks
