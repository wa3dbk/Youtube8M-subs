little while ago but 53 trophies look at

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.370 
little while ago but 53 trophies look at
that<00:04:11.980> that's<00:04:12.160> crazy<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:12.850> attack<00:04:13.140> he<00:04:14.140> has

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
that that's crazy in one attack he has

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.280 
that that's crazy in one attack he has
the<00:04:14.940> level<00:04:15.940> 7<00:04:16.239> air<00:04:16.360> defenses<00:04:16.900> though<00:04:17.080> which

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
the level 7 air defenses though which

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.170 
the level 7 air defenses though which
would<00:04:17.440> be<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.590> problem<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.250> he's<00:04:18.610> upgrading<00:04:19.120> to

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
would be a problem and he's upgrading to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.720 
would be a problem and he's upgrading to
level<00:04:19.510> 4<00:04:19.750> tehsil<00:04:20.170> right<00:04:20.320> now<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:21.549> is

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
level 4 tehsil right now but that is

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.180 
level 4 tehsil right now but that is
amazing<00:04:22.120> 53<00:04:22.960> trophies<00:04:23.350> for<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:23.650> attack<00:04:23.950> I

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
amazing 53 trophies for one attack I

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.280 
amazing 53 trophies for one attack I
think<00:04:24.520> it's<00:04:24.670> because<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.570> is<00:04:25.690> trophies<00:04:26.110> or

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
think it's because this is trophies or

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.680 
think it's because this is trophies or
200<00:04:26.740> higher<00:04:26.950> than<00:04:27.190> mine<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.270> back<00:04:28.480> when<00:04:28.510> I

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
200 higher than mine this is back when I

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.530 
200 higher than mine this is back when I
was<00:04:28.810> like<00:04:29.020> 2,200<00:04:29.650> 2,300<00:04:29.920> so<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.180> gives<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.480> a

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
was like 2,200 2,300 so it gives you a

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.440 
was like 2,200 2,300 so it gives you a
little<00:04:31.690> extra<00:04:31.870> boost<00:04:32.230> if<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.590> beat<00:04:32.770> them<00:04:33.450> so

it<00:05:00.490> worked<00:05:00.700> but<00:05:00.910> look<00:05:01.090> at<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.500> 253,000<00:05:02.500> I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
it worked but look at that 253,000 I

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.050 
it worked but look at that 253,000 I
need<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.919> come<00:05:03.070> back<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.370> attack<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.820> guy
