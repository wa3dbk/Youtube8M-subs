is very functional it comes razor-sharp
right<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.020> s30v<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:08.220> take<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.819> hold<00:02:09.599> a

right the s30v can take and hold a
razor-sharp<00:02:11.009> edge<00:02:11.550> let's<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.720> maybe<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.290> little

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
razor-sharp edge let's do maybe a little

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.370 
razor-sharp edge let's do maybe a little
bit<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.920> cutting<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.819> some<00:02:15.300> paracord

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.960 

and<00:02:19.790> let's<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:22.310> try<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> quadruple

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and let's see try to do a quadruple

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.010 
and let's see try to do a quadruple
strand<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:25.230> keep<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> frame

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
strand here keep it in the frame

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.990 
strand here keep it in the frame
all<00:02:28.020> right<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:30.050> quadruple<00:02:31.050> strand<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:32.000> your

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
all right the quadruple strand of your

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.770 
all right the quadruple strand of your
standard<00:02:33.480> paracord<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.940> as<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.330> see<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
standard paracord and as you can see it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.120 
standard paracord and as you can see it
made<00:02:36.959> very<00:02:37.230> short<00:02:37.650> work<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.790> paracord

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
made very short work of the paracord

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.370 
made very short work of the paracord
let's<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> little<00:02:41.760> bit<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.060> rope<00:02:44.870> as<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.200> can

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
let's do a little bit of rope as you can

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.340 
let's do a little bit of rope as you can
see<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> s30v<00:02:47.270> just<00:02:48.270> chainsaws<00:02:48.930> right

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
see the s30v just chainsaws right

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.170 
see the s30v just chainsaws right
through<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:49.800> thick<00:02:50.160> rope<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.910> lot

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
through that's thick rope that's a lot

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.790 
through that's thick rope that's a lot
thicker<00:02:51.420> than<00:02:51.720> paracord<00:02:52.290> okay

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
thicker than paracord okay

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.229 
thicker than paracord okay
and<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:55.350> chainsaws<00:02:56.010> through<00:02:56.519> that

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and it just it chainsaws through that

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.979 
and it just it chainsaws through that
cordage<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.989> nothing<00:02:58.790> great<00:02:59.790> steel<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.480> as

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
cordage like nothing great steel and as

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.759 
cordage like nothing great steel and as
you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.709> see<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.130> comes<00:03:02.760> from<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> factory

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
you can see it comes from the factory

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.759 
you can see it comes from the factory

well<00:03:58.650> first<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:59.040> all<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.370> deployment<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.239> is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
well first of all the deployment is is

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.069 
well first of all the deployment is is
extremely<00:04:01.739> easy<00:04:02.310> extremely<00:04:03.209> fast<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.780> mean<00:04:03.930> it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
extremely easy extremely fast I mean it

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.740 
extremely easy extremely fast I mean it
it<00:04:04.260> basically<00:04:04.769> deploys<00:04:05.340> as<00:04:05.730> fast<00:04:06.390> as<00:04:06.630> an

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
it basically deploys as fast as an

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.009 
it basically deploys as fast as an
automatic<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.160> manual<00:04:09.019> second

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
automatic and it's a manual second

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.490 
automatic and it's a manual second
reason<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.500> s30v<00:04:11.220> steel<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:12.090> just

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
reason is the s30v steel is just

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.490 
reason is the s30v steel is just
incredibly<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:15.269> can<00:04:15.570> take<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> super<00:04:16.229> sharp

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
incredibly it can take a super sharp

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.949 
incredibly it can take a super sharp
edge<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.280> holds<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.850> much<00:04:18.299> longer<00:04:18.600> than<00:04:18.930> a

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
edge and it holds it much longer than a

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.690 
edge and it holds it much longer than a
cheaper<00:04:19.410> steel<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.190> very<00:04:20.430> high

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
cheaper steel it's just a very high

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.520 
cheaper steel it's just a very high
quality<00:04:20.760> steel<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.989> for<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> $60<00:04:23.520> price<00:04:23.820> tag

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
quality steel and for the $60 price tag

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.830 
quality steel and for the $60 price tag
it's<00:04:25.530> great<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.039> get<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.250> steel<00:04:26.820> now<00:04:27.780> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
it's great to get that steel now the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.230 
it's great to get that steel now the
design<00:04:28.349> of<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.710> blade<00:04:28.830> itself<00:04:29.340> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
design of the blade itself just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.420 
design of the blade itself just
the<00:04:30.449> classic<00:04:30.930> drop<00:04:31.229> point<00:04:31.620> combined<00:04:32.070> with<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
the classic drop point combined with the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.939 
the classic drop point combined with the
hollow<00:04:32.669> grind<00:04:33.169> that's<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.289> very<00:04:34.500> conventional

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
hollow grind that's a very conventional

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.850 
hollow grind that's a very conventional
design<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.850> know<00:04:36.000> there's<00:04:36.210> there's<00:04:36.570> no

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
design you know there's there's no

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.230 
design you know there's there's no
gimmicks<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:38.130> anything<00:04:38.400> like<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:38.759> there's

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
gimmicks or anything like that there's

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.830 
gimmicks or anything like that there's
no<00:04:39.389> extra<00:04:39.780> stuff<00:04:40.169> on<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:41.580> sometimes<00:04:41.910> a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
no extra stuff on it but sometimes a

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.159 
no extra stuff on it but sometimes a
design<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:44.340> know<00:04:44.460> remains<00:04:45.169> unchanged

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
design you know remains unchanged

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.620 
design you know remains unchanged
because<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.160> design<00:04:47.520> works<00:04:47.880> good<00:04:48.240> there's

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
because if the design works good there's
