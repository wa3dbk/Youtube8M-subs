00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
perfectly even because I know when I

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960 
perfectly even because I know when I
used<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.470> get<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:20.709> hair<00:02:20.890> braided<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.850> know

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
used to get my hair braided you know

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.610 
used to get my hair braided you know
they<00:02:22.120> would<00:02:22.270> use<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> butane<00:02:22.870> lighter<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.470> then

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
they would use a butane lighter and then

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.229 
they would use a butane lighter and then
the<00:02:23.800> ends<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.610> know<00:02:24.730> they<00:02:24.940> will<00:02:25.030> burn

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
the ends of it you know they will burn

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.940 
the ends of it you know they will burn
it<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.690> would<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.080> jagged<00:02:26.530> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
it but it would be like jagged and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.920 
it but it would be like jagged and
raggedy<00:02:27.489> looking<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.480> was<00:02:28.600> nothing<00:02:28.870> I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
raggedy looking and it was nothing I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.479 
raggedy looking and it was nothing I
could<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.170> at<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.410> point<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.280> has

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
could do at that point so this has

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.370 
could do at that point so this has
perfect<00:02:31.090> exactly<00:02:31.540> long<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.930> same<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.350> I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
perfect exactly long it's the same way I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.650 
perfect exactly long it's the same way I
mean<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.920> we'd<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.580> uneven<00:02:34.450> look

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
mean that we'd have that uneven look

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
mean that we'd have that uneven look
