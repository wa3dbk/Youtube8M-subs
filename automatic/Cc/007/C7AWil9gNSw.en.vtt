00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
at the timing gear out and don't ever

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
at the timing gear out and don't ever
you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.520> press<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> shed<00:00:48.360> I'll<00:00:48.780> do

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you can press there in the shed I'll do

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can press there in the shed I'll do
it<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.820> men's<00:00:50.820> workshop<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.690> trying<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it my men's workshop but trying to do it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
it my men's workshop but trying to do it
at<00:00:52.860> home<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.969> having<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> trouble

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
at home and then having a bit of trouble

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.000 
at home and then having a bit of trouble
so<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.230> thought<00:00:55.320> I'd<00:00:55.410> show<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.860> I've

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so just thought I'd show you how I've

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
so just thought I'd show you how I've
done<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> maybe<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.449> other<00:00:57.629> people<00:00:57.989> who<00:00:58.050> don't

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
done it maybe for other people who don't

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
done it maybe for other people who don't
have<00:00:58.320> compressed<00:00:59.100> air<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.340> their<00:00:59.460> shed<00:01:05.330> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
have compressed air in their shed so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.500 
have compressed air in their shed so
here's<00:01:06.689> an<00:01:06.930> angle<00:01:07.290> meself<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
here's an angle meself so there's the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.070 
here's an angle meself so there's the
crank<00:01:10.610> crank<00:01:11.610> pulley<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> bottom<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
crank crank pulley at the bottom and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.050 
crank crank pulley at the bottom and
obviously<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.220> spins<00:01:14.490> around<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> motor

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
obviously it spins around when the motor

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.149 
obviously it spins around when the motor
spins<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.450> I've<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> wheels<00:01:16.080> off<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
spins around I've got the wheels off the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.190 
spins around I've got the wheels off the
ground<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.700> putting<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> gear<00:01:18.390> isn't<00:01:18.990> going

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
ground so putting it in gear isn't going

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
ground so putting it in gear isn't going
to<00:01:19.290> dry<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.680> enough<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.340> I'll<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.180> actually

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to dry out enough so I'll have actually

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.320 
to dry out enough so I'll have actually
done<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> I've<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.869> old<00:01:22.020> V<00:01:22.200> belt<00:01:23.060> right<00:01:24.060> there

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
done is I've an old V belt right there

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.530 
done is I've an old V belt right there
and<00:01:25.400> I'll<00:01:26.400> whack<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.759> over<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> pulley<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and I'll whack it over the pulley and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.929 
and I'll whack it over the pulley and
then<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.810> made<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
then I made up you can see it there a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.740 
then I made up you can see it there a
wooden<00:01:30.840> wedge<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.740> cut<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> wooden<00:01:32.250> wedge

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
wooden wedge so cut a wooden wedge

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.880 
wooden wedge so cut a wooden wedge
banged<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> rubber<00:01:34.259> mallet<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
banged it up with a rubber mallet and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.870 
banged it up with a rubber mallet and
then<00:01:35.189> I've<00:01:35.310> used<00:01:36.020> my<00:01:37.020> breaker<00:01:37.259> bar<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.979> once

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
then I've used my breaker bar and once

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.980 
then I've used my breaker bar and once
again<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:40.350> trusty<00:01:40.799> rubber<00:01:41.729> mallet<00:01:42.180> give<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
again the trusty rubber mallet give it a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
again the trusty rubber mallet give it a
couple<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> knocks<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.240> see

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
couple of knocks and now as you can see

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
couple of knocks and now as you can see
the<00:01:45.990> nut<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.710> loose<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.090> my

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the nut is loose you have to take my

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.520 
the nut is loose you have to take my
word<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:48.930> spinning<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.320> with<00:01:49.409> my

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
word for it so I'm spinning it with my

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
word for it so I'm spinning it with my
fingers<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.909> guys<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.270> get
