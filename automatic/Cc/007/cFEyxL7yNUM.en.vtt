00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.820 
different textured textures so stop
using<00:02:04.980> heat<00:02:05.550> totally<00:02:06.300> for<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> while<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
using heat totally for a while the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.440 
using heat totally for a while the
second<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> recommend<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.240> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
second thing I want to recommend is to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.570 
second thing I want to recommend is to
use<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.869> protein<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.070> moisturizing

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
use a protein and a moisturizing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.580 
use a protein and a moisturizing
treatment<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.720> my<00:02:12.810> favorite<00:02:13.230> protein

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
treatment one of my favorite protein

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
treatment one of my favorite protein
treatments<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.190> after<00:02:14.610> G's<00:02:14.790> two-minute

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
treatments is after G's two-minute

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300 
treatments is after G's two-minute
Reconstructor<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> love<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.770> thing<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.160> works

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
Reconstructor I love that thing it works

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.050 
Reconstructor I love that thing it works
really<00:02:17.760> well<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.450> haven't<00:02:18.990> ever<00:02:19.200> used<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
really well I haven't ever used the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.940 
really well I haven't ever used the
two-step<00:02:21.060> Reconstructor<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.590> I've<00:02:22.710> heard

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
two-step Reconstructor but I've heard

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
two-step Reconstructor but I've heard
this<00:02:23.100> really<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.300> situation<00:02:25.110> where<00:02:25.290> your

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
this really for a situation where your

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710 
this really for a situation where your
hair<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.590> kind<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.160> really<00:02:26.880> falling<00:02:27.600> out

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
hair is kind of like really falling out

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.570 
hair is kind of like really falling out
at<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> ends<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.070> that's<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.400> situation

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
at the ends but if that's the situation

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.620 
at the ends but if that's the situation
definitely<00:02:30.480> use<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> 2<00:02:31.140> 2<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.980> 2<00:02:32.520> step<00:02:33.000> one<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:33.600> I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
definitely use a 2 2 a 2 step one but I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.270 
definitely use a 2 2 a 2 step one but I
find<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.260> two<00:02:34.470> minute<00:02:34.680> reconstructing

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
find that the two minute reconstructing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.000 
find that the two minute reconstructing
is<00:02:35.430> exactly<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.870> my<00:02:37.080> hair<00:02:37.350> has<00:02:37.530> needed<00:02:37.890> in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
is exactly what my hair has needed in

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.730 
is exactly what my hair has needed in
the<00:02:38.100> past<00:02:38.340> when<00:02:39.150> I've<00:02:39.390> had<00:02:39.420> heat<00:02:40.170> damaged

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
the past when I've had heat damaged

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.160 
the past when I've had heat damaged
after<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> protein<00:02:42.390> treatment<00:02:42.990> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
after you do a protein treatment you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.210 
after you do a protein treatment you
definitely<00:02:43.590> want<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.770> followup<00:02:44.070> with

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
definitely want to followup with

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.360 
definitely want to followup with
moisture<00:02:44.910> because<00:02:45.180> once<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.650> protein<00:02:47.160> is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
moisture because once the protein is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070 
moisture because once the protein is
back<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.880> your<00:02:48.000> hair<00:02:48.270> because<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.720> remember

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
back in your hair because you remember

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.130 
back in your hair because you remember
when<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.580> when<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.730> use<00:02:50.910> heat<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.420> damage

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
when you when you use heat you damage

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.740 
when you when you use heat you damage
the<00:02:52.800> protein<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:53.520> hair<00:02:53.670> which<00:02:54.209> causes

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the protein in your hair which causes

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.420 
the protein in your hair which causes
your<00:02:54.900> hair<00:02:55.020> not<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.410> even<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.920> able<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.250> hold

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
your hair not to even be able to hold

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.280 
your hair not to even be able to hold
moisture<00:02:56.670> anymore<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.840> once<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.110> put<00:02:58.230> that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
moisture anymore so once you put that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.000 
moisture anymore so once you put that
protein<00:02:58.860> back<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.910> moisture<00:03:00.360> treatment

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
in in length more than anything but it

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.920 
in in length more than anything but it
really<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.040> something<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:48.150> should

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
really is something that you should

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.310 
really is something that you should
think<00:03:48.959> about<00:03:49.290> doing<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:50.070> cutting<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:51.600> dead

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
think about doing is cutting the dead

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.039 
think about doing is cutting the dead
ends<00:03:52.830> or<00:03:52.920> they<00:03:53.040> heat<00:03:53.310> damaged<00:03:53.790> hair<00:03:54.060> off<00:03:54.269> now

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
ends or they heat damaged hair off now

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.280 
ends or they heat damaged hair off now
you<00:03:55.110> might<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:56.430> might<00:03:57.000> seem<00:03:57.330> extreme<00:03:57.480> because

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
you might it might seem extreme because

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.380 
you might it might seem extreme because
maybe<00:03:59.070> all<00:03:59.489> over<00:03:59.820> here

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
maybe all over here

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.840 
maybe all over here
damage<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.230> roots<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.490> maybe<00:04:02.700> you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
damage to the roots and so maybe you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.760 
damage to the roots and so maybe you
