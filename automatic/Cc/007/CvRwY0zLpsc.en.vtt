00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:10.070
 Yes, I also do 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.070
 Today I have a little high white board 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 Hey participation amateur of people 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 I'm in front of you, but a little bit of the story before the war 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.570
 Recently I mean tactics funny formation I'll try kana and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.439
 Say 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.430
 If you know the world cup is going to be interesting now 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.120
 Before you are waiting for one person Well-loving soccer Nde there is to say I wonder if I watch more interesting 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 The story of is dead, but I think I'm going to talk a little 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.559
 This is the kind of formation 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.290
 Formation It is good if it is not like Margret in the strategy board but 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.370
 Well then today 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.370
 Is it 433 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.900
 What is a constant third 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.130
 It is voice 4 3 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.080
 Four 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 I This is the case here wants Fore The can is the middle of the zone cat 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.300
 Kept from behind 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.460
 433 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.240
 It will be referred to in this kind of Fu 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 I need it 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.660
 so 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:34.280
 Well this is over here and defensive 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.830
 I also say 4123 in the midfielder and aggressive midfield 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.020
 so 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.810
 The in vogue now 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:49.050
 Well 433-It is quite popular and 433 but that 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:52.430
 I say 433 even in a real situation, but if I say that something is happening during the game 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.430
 It is popular now 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.229
 The front of 9 4 comes out here 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.540
 What 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.540
 Two of these are 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.760
 Te one of here open Oiteki 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:17.549
 With 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:24.599
 Here it is that say to change the position of 4 and 3343 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:26.780
 It's quite popular, so I'll say what it is 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.780
 The 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 I will turn the ball with three people 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:39.950
 If the opposing team is two tops while doing a No. Reversi with three people here 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.630
 You can come to 2 mark as it is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.750
 Got stuck with the course and against the goalkeeper 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.080
 I have to play a big goal 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.240
 Then I'm Fifty Fifty Like 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.760
 Often losing Anna ball or become a country of the ball 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.590
 So one comes back behind 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.720
 Well by receiving the ball here 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.000
 For example, this because this player there is a player of a place to go to the players defense that came down the cat 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.370
 Call a player 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.150
 Ishikawa too 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:18.940
 I think I'm open individual space is a little space here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.750
 9 Because the space around here will be free, here 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.140
 Real is 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:32.050
 A defender with a ball intrudes and uses this space to say 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:36.730
 Continue to dribble straight in to this space with the center back is good catch from Masuda 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:40.690
 There is a lot of play in recent years, but this is done intentionally 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.870
 We are in a well in the pin 9 space to use it more than just 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.160
 And if you use my space after all the other party is this 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.110
 Enter the center 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:55.760
 Are still attached it to this side to this side because I do not go unless we in the defense 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:00.740
 After all I hope the render will come out a little here but I'm worried and come out a little 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.420
 Even if this player was a return or this player was free, so a recent trader 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.150
 In the break by shifting opponent by and center back use the space of here if there of course 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.590
 Say go 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:15.920
 Such pattern has increased quite 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.609
 After all, the reason why two pieces and the ball keeper are connected after all is still here 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.330
 Ne 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:26.500
 Make a course where you can receive the ball in the side bag in this culture medium this past year 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.000
 Before from being taken or of course point while if we have the ball in after all their own territory 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.649
 Don't think 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.990
 There is a lot of risk if it is taken here 

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:40.409
 It says if the individual risk on the contrary go before I'm going before in 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.889
 Here is this 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.889
 The following 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:53.639
 So 9 players are going to be strong here 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:05:00.030
 Players this was in Boranchi than to become a three to come is one of 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.050
 Is possible to cover even touch care was attacked last-minute side line it was Well 3 people 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.650
 I can do it 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.920
 Is behind the players, including the risk management say so 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:15.250
 It is possible to think so far as tactical theory 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:17.380
 This on because the other which is incorporated as a team as the other natural Manyuu was common sense 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.570
 So who is this player 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:26.320
 Or organic, but the players there is no one what features are throwing Coates in the team How so 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:30.310
 Selfishly say I'd become the words Well of course point to function in 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:36.100
 I can say this was reflected in the 433 today 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:42.610
 It's like 44 if it moves like this or 451 if it is a yeast , it's basic even in a talk 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:46.340
 So much a So now players what Nde want to see the system I've decided all 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:50.600
 When it comes to moving, it is already a new trend 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.990
 It is almost gone the other day and is almost ne- 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.320
 Oh 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:02.060
 It is not because how we move the system Well, if this in addition, for example 442 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.150
 It seems like this has moved, but if you come out with a new one 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:10.090
 I think it will be noticed from the world if it has become 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.090
 I think I'm going to be a Daimon , but I guess it's not quite 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.910
 For example 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:21.960
 If the left- handed player on the left side is left-handed, it is easy to raise such a ball 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:26.699
 But recently right-handed players 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:30.509
 Is but a left-handed player to 4 player right I God to the left 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:35.070
 Dribbling into the stomach with the 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:40.110
 Well So easy to hit chute entered into you were left purse popular players 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:45.990
 So I say this is there cross to go to the outside you were left-handed player left 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:51.180
 Tiki will be for the combination such like have also recently considered really over here in the side 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:54.440
 Depending on whether you put the player on the side or put the player on the side, who is the individual player 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.139
 It is up to this kind of place to prepare Meehidechocho 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.910
 It is considered 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:03.070
 Look at that 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:05.409
 I think we, for example, and cry doing there is also good left foot left location but is right-handed 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.160
 Doing left-back 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.820
 I'm in a powder crisis but 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.200
 Sentence is not here 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:15.240
 Oh in Japan representative 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:17.720
 It's 442 so it's not here for a while, so let's leave it to the left side 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:22.639
 When we look at such places 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:27.590
 It's interesting that it's a bit recent trend 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:30.280
 I'm 4 back but I'm 2 back and I touch one person 3 back and attack 343 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.729
 The story of such a process owner 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.509
 It will be more than the fact that I was allowed to 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.509
 It was
