00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.660
 Let's open it about a box 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.519
 Hmmm 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:16.740
 It is macbook air 2013 model of what is introduced this time with yes 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.410
 And I ride, but the newest is the guy out of course 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.400
 re N 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.990
 It is this that we introduced the other day and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.130
 The 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.570
 It is this to introduce today 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:36.790
 There are 2 units here but they are completely together 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:42.110
 Only the people who bought the price and the spec together are different 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 The same couple we met today 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 I would like to introduce this 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:54.580
 eh 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:01:01.780
 It is a mug government of this one is a new guy or habit is a 2012 model that I have 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:03.350
 Please be careful not to make a mistake because the person is normal The standards are different and here is usb 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.070
 3 points 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:13.920
 It's a zero usb 3.0 and two mics on headphones this is a dual mic 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.670
 So I think I can pick it up with a pretty good sound 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.100
 It's thunderbolt here and here too usb 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.460
 It is not an optical disk drive and there is entered or Toka sd card slot 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.049
 There is a kind of space it because a little small 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.049
 Let's open it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 Ai-chan: Now turn on the power 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.920
 For example Well Netto medium but this is the Mac 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.920
 By say ssd it is early in the crazy rise 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.460
 Yes and thank you are the cat screen 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.149
 Yes 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.120
 Real Macs can now be used 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.190
 so 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.420
 Well , I want to do various things as soon as everyone can use the tools . 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:12.810
 But there are things that must always be done first 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:15.760
 First of all, it is a software update When such a sound must be bought well 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.299
 Nde I think I and something one has come 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.299
 Please update that software 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.800
 Do not start it over there even when you say how you want to restart when the update is over 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.800
 not 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.360
 The up student is finally over with yes 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.270
 Thank you for you for waiting 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.410
 By say 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 After all the update is over, what should I do next ? 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.170
 I 'm not sure but the place above here 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:58.540
 Take time machine or bluetooth 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:02.590
 I have to do some battery settings and so on 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.940
 Well this is also a plow but with the lower dog golden 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:12.400
 Well yes please go is your favorite person 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:18.020
 The writing since have gained much trouble I Well macbook air ssd 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.830
 I wanted to introduce it with an app that says how fast the speed is 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.270
 Because the little I did not come to find today 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.790
 Well that's the day after 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.790
 I would like to introduce another time 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.930
 3 hours from that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.519
 It's been a while, though 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.329
 It is an application of speed test that I found just before found 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.780
 Disk speed test is a Mac app store 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.800
 is there 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.270
 It is a free app to which I said 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.170
 mac disk 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:01.209
 this measures the speed of reading and writing to the sky 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.370
 First of all, I will look at my macbook pro 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:11.590
 Then the screen please your partner from now 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.660
 I would like to do with the macbook pro 2012 model 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:20.600
 After 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:24.870
 It is the speed of writing that I'm writing now if you are moving now 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:29.770
 About 59.6 seconds per second mb 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:36.610
 I wonder if I can read it 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:44.139
 I 'm counting now, about 78 mb for about a second 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.889
 Well this is Well speed Tesutoa such a feeling of those who turn actually disk is spinning hard disk 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.129
 Is it 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.199
 In the case of my mac 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:59.249
 Oh, it is such a feeling Please remember this number roughly 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:05.219
 It is macbook air to have you look at it next time to have it look from now on 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:06.089
 Exactly the same conditions but is what another guy had been opened to and also I is what another guy 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.120
 is 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:12.980
 Contents are empty 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:17.150
 Oh that the same generation same price same day arrived 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.850
 You can see it under the same conditions 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.850
 Let's go get ready start 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.320
 Wonder if there 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:38.360
 If the writing is roughly 314 mb 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.880
 It takes 705 mb for reading in seconds 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.900
 is not it 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:48.510
 So this one is about five times the previous one 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:53.390
 About 10 times that of the previous one was about 9 times 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:58.580
 I think this is really the attraction of ssd 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:01.819
 It was a report saying that it is much faster than hard disk 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.190
 It's yes, but today is a little 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:09.180
 Number of times 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.180
 It seems that nasa was Ichi Miyauchi tension to video with Ne 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.569
 As I was not able to fall in love a little 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:22.080
 I would like to introduce you later if I have come up with something else 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:27.689
 Well, today is thin for now 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.989
 It was a story that Macbook Air came 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.989
 Then
