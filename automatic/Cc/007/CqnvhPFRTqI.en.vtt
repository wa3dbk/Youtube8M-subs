00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899 

one<00:00:00.510> of<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.719> fundamentals<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.790> fluid<00:00:02.790> acts

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
one of the fundamentals of fluid acts

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.090 
one of the fundamentals of fluid acts
diseases<00:00:03.449> that<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:04.110> it<00:00:04.230> allows<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.859> foot

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
diseases that is that it allows the foot

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.480 
diseases that is that it allows the foot
to<00:00:05.160> measure<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:06.710> allowing<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.010> fridge<00:00:08.250> move

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
to measure so allowing the fridge move

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.970 
to measure so allowing the fridge move
naturally<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.269> lot<00:00:09.870> more<00:00:10.080> fruit<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.440> do<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.769> only

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
naturally a lot more fruit to do it only

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.799 
naturally a lot more fruit to do it only
goes<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:12.889> that<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> fundamental<00:00:15.030> story

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
goes so that was the fundamental story

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.939 
goes so that was the fundamental story
behind<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:16.800> let<00:00:17.369> me<00:00:18.380> show<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.410> something

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
behind it up let me show you something

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.480 
behind it up let me show you something
with<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:22.020> background<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> story<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
with you the background of the story is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.660 
with you the background of the story is
that<00:00:23.869> traditionally<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.199> today<00:00:25.740> footwear<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that traditionally and today footwear is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
that traditionally and today footwear is
built<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.599> simple<00:00:28.170> story<00:00:28.380> around

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
built you know a simple story around

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.690 
built you know a simple story around
ankle<00:00:29.640> joint<00:00:29.900> rotation<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.500> footwear<00:00:32.399> has

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
ankle joint rotation so footwear has

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.049 
ankle joint rotation so footwear has
been<00:00:32.969> designed<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> sort<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> make<00:00:34.050> this

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
been designed to sort of make this

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.479 
been designed to sort of make this
motion<00:00:36.770> just<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:38.820> simple<00:00:39.629> movement<00:00:40.079> around<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
motion just a simple movement around the

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.040 
motion just a simple movement around the
ankle<00:00:41.489> X's<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.809> pen

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
ankle X's as you can see with my pen

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.369 
ankle X's as you can see with my pen
here<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.899> example<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
here and then we would for example a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590 
here and then we would for example a
stability<00:00:46.860> devicenet<00:00:47.460> sharing<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
stability devicenet sharing you have a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.130 
stability devicenet sharing you have a
stratification<00:00:48.989> issue<00:00:50.360> we<00:00:51.360> went<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
stratification issue we went back to the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
stratification issue we went back to the
fundamentals<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> our<00:00:54.210> advisors

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
fundamentals with some of our advisors

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.709 
fundamentals with some of our advisors
like<00:00:55.140> tears<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.070> Simon<00:00:56.730> Bartow<00:00:57.059> mr.<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
like tears and with Simon Bartow mr. a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.889 
like tears and with Simon Bartow mr. a
Howard<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.559> read<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.969> how<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.629> use

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
Howard we read look at how we don't use

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.130 
Howard we read look at how we don't use
so<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.890> say<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.930> detangle<00:01:03.930> joint

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so we say actually detangle joint

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
so we say actually detangle joint
movement<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.280> limiting<00:01:05.909> point<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
movement is just a limiting point of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000 
movement is just a limiting point of
view<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> build<00:01:07.650> shoes

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
view on how do you want to build shoes

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
view on how do you want to build shoes
so<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.060> looked<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.570> pm's<00:01:11.210> what<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.330> did<00:01:14.780> we

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so we looked at some pm's what we did we

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
so we looked at some pm's what we did we
focused<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.250> subtalar<00:01:17.700> joint<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
focused on the subtalar joint and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.910 
focused on the subtalar joint and
sometimes<00:01:18.720> joined<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.650> here

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
sometimes joined is where you see here

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.100 
sometimes joined is where you see here
in<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> screen<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> blue<00:01:21.600> red<00:01:21.780> spot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
in on the screen and the blue red spot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.030 
in on the screen and the blue red spot
sometimes<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:23.310> located<00:01:24.060> roughly<00:01:24.270> here

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
sometimes are located roughly here

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
sometimes are located roughly here
rotates<00:01:26.040> around<00:01:26.640> different<00:01:27.299> accents<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
rotates around different accents so the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.880 
rotates around different accents so the
so<00:01:29.460> third<00:01:29.640> joint<00:01:29.970> has<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> rotation<00:01:31.380> axes<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
so third joint has a rotation axes and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.570 
so third joint has a rotation axes and
actually

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
actually

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.320 
actually
pretty<00:01:33.090> well<00:01:33.330> here<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.190> big<00:01:35.430> poster<00:01:35.910> it

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
pretty well here on this big poster it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.040 
pretty well here on this big poster it
starts<00:01:37.050> here<00:01:37.260> in<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.250> lateral<00:01:38.640> heel<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
starts here in the lateral heel and it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.440 
starts here in the lateral heel and it
goes<00:01:40.230> straight<00:01:40.440> through<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.130> foot<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.150> comes

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
goes straight through the foot and comes

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.140 
goes straight through the foot and comes
out<00:01:42.660> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.200> medial<00:01:43.530> forefoot<00:01:44.010> that<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.910> the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
out in the medial forefoot that is the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.620 
out in the medial forefoot that is the
rotation<00:01:45.810> axis<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.770> subtalar<00:01:47.220> joint<00:01:47.930> and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
rotation axis of the subtalar joint and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.360 
rotation axis of the subtalar joint and
the<00:01:51.630> rotation<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> accident<00:01:52.650> is<00:01:53.070> far

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
the rotation of that accident is far

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.640 
the rotation of that accident is far
more<00:01:53.610> important<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.480> running<00:01:54.810> motion<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
more important for running motion and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.740 
more important for running motion and
rotation<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.880> ankles<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.570> would

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
rotation of the ankles so if you would

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
rotation of the ankles so if you would
look<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.260> shoe<00:02:01.530> I'll<00:02:02.100> show<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.730> all<00:02:02.850> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
look at the shoe I'll show it to all of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.110 
look at the shoe I'll show it to all of
you<00:02:03.530> looking<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.950> axis<00:02:05.460> are<00:02:05.760> pushing<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
you looking at this axis are pushing to

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.790 
you looking at this axis are pushing to
you<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.930> axis<00:02:07.290> would<00:02:07.440> go<00:02:07.620> like

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
you like this the axis would go like

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.630 
you like this the axis would go like
this<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:09.690> rotation<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.800> foot<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.340> shoe

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
this the rotation of the foot and shoe

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.380 
this the rotation of the foot and shoe
would<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:14.459> pronation

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
would be like this so pronation

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
would be like this so pronation
supination<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.560> that's<00:02:17.340> what<00:02:17.760> was<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
supination and that's what was the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.210 
supination and that's what was the
fundamental<00:02:18.870> part<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.160> wanted<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
fundamental part of what we wanted to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.440 
fundamental part of what we wanted to
use<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.850> fluid<00:02:24.150> exits<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.170> fluid<00:02:25.590> axis<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:27.390> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
use for fluid exits the fluid axis is a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.390 
use for fluid exits the fluid axis is a
story<00:02:27.990> built<00:02:28.440> around<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.340> rotation<00:02:31.400> around

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
story built around to rotation around

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.610 
story built around to rotation around
the<00:02:32.550> subtalar<00:02:33.060> joint<00:02:33.090> accidents<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.290> this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the subtalar joint accidents so this

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.550 
the subtalar joint accidents so this
rotation<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.970> would<00:02:36.120> issue<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.350> this

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
rotation if you would issue so this

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.140 
rotation if you would issue so this
rotation<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.489> running<00:02:38.880> motion<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:41.150> pronation

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
rotation in running motion and pronation

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.199 
rotation in running motion and pronation
and<00:02:42.600> supination<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:43.620> fundamental<00:02:44.550> part<00:02:44.850> how

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and supination are fundamental part how

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.960 
and supination are fundamental part how
the<00:02:45.570> body<00:02:45.830> takes<00:02:46.830> care<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> natural

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the body takes care of natural

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.740 
the body takes care of natural
cushioning<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:48.630> you're<00:02:48.780> running<00:02:48.989> so

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
cushioning when you're running so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.509 
cushioning when you're running so
pronation<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.170> heel<00:02:52.530> striking<00:02:52.830> from<00:02:53.100> sense

and<00:02:53.850> recent<00:02:54.269> mission<00:02:54.660> at<00:02:54.810> total<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.070> is

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
and recent mission at total so that is

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.240 
and recent mission at total so that is
the<00:02:56.400> fundamental<00:02:56.670> idea<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.690> how<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.860> want<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the fundamental idea of how we want to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.640 
the fundamental idea of how we want to
build<00:02:59.820> shoes<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.510> different<00:03:00.900> way<00:03:01.019> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
build shoes in a different way so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.970 
build shoes in a different way so

construction from the lateral heel to
the<00:03:38.450> medial<00:03:38.930> forefoot<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.579> exactly<00:03:40.970> the

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
the medial forefoot that is exactly the

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.979 
the medial forefoot that is exactly the
same<00:03:41.629> axis<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.129> see<00:03:43.459> when<00:03:44.299> you<00:03:44.480> rotate

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
same axis that you see when you rotate

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.770 
same axis that you see when you rotate
the<00:03:45.260> foot<00:03:45.530> around<00:03:45.859> subtalar<00:03:46.640> joint<00:03:46.670> axis<00:03:47.299> so

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
the foot around subtalar joint axis so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.740 
the foot around subtalar joint axis so
we<00:03:47.989> mimic<00:03:48.470> exactly<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:49.310> same<00:03:49.549> X's<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
we mimic exactly the same X's in the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.349 
we mimic exactly the same X's in the
structure<00:03:51.319> of<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.650> true<00:03:51.920> now<00:03:52.700> what<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:53.299> does

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
structure of the true now what this does

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.039 
structure of the true now what this does
together<00:03:54.430> with<00:03:55.430> these<00:03:55.940> two<00:03:56.299> grooves<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.810> you

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
together with these two grooves that you

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.339 
together with these two grooves that you
see<00:03:57.260> here<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.890> decouples<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.239> shoe<00:04:02.510> when

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
see here is it decouples the shoe when

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.339 
see here is it decouples the shoe when
you<00:04:04.340> strike<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.000> ground<00:04:05.180> on<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.660> heel<00:04:05.959> or<00:04:06.230> on

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
you strike the ground on the heel or on

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.589 
you strike the ground on the heel or on
the<00:04:06.470> mid-foot<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.459> when<00:04:07.849> you<00:04:08.090> strike<00:04:08.419> the

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
the mid-foot so when you strike the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.210 
the mid-foot so when you strike the
ground<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.109> when<00:04:09.290> your<00:04:09.440> foot<00:04:09.709> starts<00:04:09.980> to

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
ground and when your foot starts to

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.750 
ground and when your foot starts to
pronate<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:11.299> structure<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.049> this<00:04:12.349> you<00:04:12.760> will

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
pronate the structure of this you will

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.539 
pronate the structure of this you will
completely<00:04:14.329> adapt<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.470> how<00:04:15.739> your<00:04:16.130> foot<00:04:16.400> is

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
completely adapt to how your foot is

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.909 
completely adapt to how your foot is
moving<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.780> structure<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.739> will

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
moving so the structure is you will

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.150 
moving so the structure is you will
acknowledge<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.849> pronation<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.799> are

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
acknowledge the pronation that you are

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.879 
acknowledge the pronation that you are
creating<00:04:22.669> as<00:04:23.150> running<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:24.200> that's<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.590> first

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
creating as running so that's the first

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.100 
creating as running so that's the first
part<00:04:25.190> that's<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.669> most<00:04:25.880> important<00:04:26.389> part<00:04:26.419> so

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
part that's the most important part so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.990 
part that's the most important part so
let<00:04:27.349> me<00:04:27.380> just<00:04:27.680> write<00:04:27.950> review<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.419> side

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.320 
area the shoe will allow you to pronate
as<00:04:59.259> you<00:04:59.620> go<00:04:59.770> through<00:05:00.039> game<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.819> will<00:05:00.969> adapt

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
as you go through game and it will adapt

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.749 
as you go through game and it will adapt
to<00:05:01.569> that<00:05:01.689> provision<00:05:02.050> now<00:05:02.919> what<00:05:03.099> we<00:05:03.280> get<00:05:03.490> them

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
to that provision now what we get them

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:13.740 
to that provision now what we get them
afternoon<00:05:06.300> those<00:05:07.300> X's<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.710> added<00:05:09.279> a<00:05:12.029> same<00:05:13.029> type

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
afternoon those X's we added a same type

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.350 
afternoon those X's we added a same type
of<00:05:14.520> construction<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.789> grooves<00:05:16.060> in<00:05:16.270> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
of construction of grooves in the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.589 
of construction of grooves in the
forefoot<00:05:17.189> exactly<00:05:18.189> how<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:18.759> want<00:05:19.419> them<00:05:19.539> to

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
forefoot exactly how you want them to

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.649 
forefoot exactly how you want them to
because<00:05:20.669> after<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:21.699> come<00:05:22.000> from<00:05:22.180> a<00:05:22.270> different

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
because after you come from a different

because after you come from a different
stance<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.229> re<00:05:23.500> supinate<00:05:24.069> at<00:05:24.250> all<00:05:24.490> so<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.479> fan

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
stance you re supinate at all so the fan

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.459 
stance you re supinate at all so the fan
type<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.349> bruising<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.340> see<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.669> for<00:05:27.909> further

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
type of bruising you see the for further

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:33.559 
type of bruising you see the for further
help<00:05:29.469> you<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.689> allow<00:05:31.689> you<00:05:31.719> to<00:05:32.199> recently<00:05:32.979> told
