00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 brush attached such airbrushing effects 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 but let 's get a little more about the design 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.989
 let's talk of course the brushes are very beautiful 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 them wooden handle 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.710
 further here is the pivot on which they are 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 hold it very tight good brushes 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.440
 well stuffed rod so floral 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.000
 print very beautiful now let's 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.129
 let's deal with each brush in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.710
 Separately begin the smallest 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 tassels this little flat tassel 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.860
 for concealer who helps 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 concealer concealer on the spot exactly exactly 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.189
 tight almost perfect and possible 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 wear not only cream like 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.950
 textures but also dry and also I apply with 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.960
 using this tassel base for shadows she 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.790
 very convenient in principle even helped 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.860
 you can bring it very comfortable brush 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.189
 the next brush is a flat brush for 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.020
 concealer she is one of my favorite 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.090
 she helps me actually grind 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 the place where I applied concealer or 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.689
 corrector meaning it is so flat 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.159
 very well stuffed 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.570
 and also suitable for dry products. 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.790
 the next brush is a brush for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.610
 tonal framework but as you see 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.550
 the brush is quite small however she 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.590
 allows you to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.730
 there will be difficult areas of the face around it 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.400
 nose and for example in the area under the eyes 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.870
 let's say more often I put nevertheless concealer 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.200
 to large areas 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.290
 as well as a liquid highlighter it warms these 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.030
 funds fits just wonderful 3 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.090
 brush this brush r so let's say knocking out 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.580
 dry and cream products i put it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.000
 foundation and powder can be applied to it 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.220
 i just adore she very evenly she 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.410
 apply a very thin layer tonal 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.030
 the base 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.500
 drive it practically into the skin but 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.990
 very, very gently, that is, consumption 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.300
 products thanks to this tassel very 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.910
 it is very small itself 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.120
 nice too well stuffed 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.870
 and finally the third brush is a brush for 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.670
 powder 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.410
 also it can be used for blush 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.970
 because and for the bronzer but because 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.260
 she is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.350
 pointy as you see too 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.990
 comfortable enough soft and pleasant and not 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.050
 only positive about it 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.880
 March can say brushes are very good 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.820
 they wash easily soaps wash easily 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.890
 shampoo but i wouldn't call these brushes 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.180
 road set because after all in 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.060
 we take the road 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.970
 if we take a brush for concealer, then she 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.040
 one if we take a brush let's say for powder 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.160
 or for the foundation, too, 1 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.770
 here , after all, 5 brushes for the face and this 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.660
 no longer a road home set but 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.770
 no less i'm happy enough that 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.020
 I purchased this kit 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.360
 Basically everything I wanted to talk about 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.460
 I told him so if you have 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.310
 some questions if something could be 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.520
 forgot to mention honored set from anyone 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.180
 less than 15 dollars I ordered it on the site 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.150
