does Caroline want to become I don't
know<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:14.160> think<00:04:14.880> right<00:04:15.360> now<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.570> mean<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
know I think right now I mean that

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.770 
know I think right now I mean that
really<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:17.130> as<00:04:17.910> far<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.239> coming<00:04:18.510> back<00:04:18.660> home

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
really is is as far as coming back home

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.690 
really is is as far as coming back home
to<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.019> season<00:04:19.440> her<00:04:19.680> main<00:04:19.829> focus<00:04:19.859> really<00:04:20.489> is

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
to the season her main focus really is

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.670 
to the season her main focus really is
just<00:04:20.730> what<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.750> she<00:04:21.870> gonna<00:04:21.959> do<00:04:22.230> with<00:04:22.260> her<00:04:22.500> life

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
just what is she gonna do with her life

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.980 
just what is she gonna do with her life
so<00:04:22.980> I<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.640> genuinely<00:04:24.570> what

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
so I think that is a genuinely what

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.110 
so I think that is a genuinely what
she's<00:04:25.200> trying<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.530> figure<00:04:25.710> out<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.790> she<00:04:26.850> really

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
she's trying to figure out so she really

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.730 
she's trying to figure out so she really
gonna<00:04:27.360> take<00:04:27.630> her<00:04:27.780> time<00:04:27.960> because<00:04:28.200> after<00:04:28.470> you

you're gonna realize those things about
yourself<00:07:11.319> and<00:07:11.680> while<00:07:12.039> you're<00:07:12.250> also<00:07:12.370> learning

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
yourself and while you're also learning

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:16.980 
yourself and while you're also learning
about<00:07:12.969> the<00:07:13.090> character<00:07:13.569> you're<00:07:15.479> you<00:07:16.479> know<00:07:16.599> as

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
about the character you're you know as

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.860 
about the character you're you know as
you<00:07:17.289> say<00:07:17.669> things<00:07:18.669> and<00:07:18.879> a<00:07:19.000> certain<00:07:19.330> cadence<00:07:19.539> the

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870 
you say things and a certain cadence the

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.869 
you say things and a certain cadence the
writers<00:07:20.289> pick<00:07:20.560> up<00:07:20.680> on<00:07:20.860> that<00:07:21.009> so<00:07:21.370> there<00:07:21.580> is

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 
writers pick up on that so there is

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.969 
writers pick up on that so there is
inevitably<00:07:22.389> a<00:07:22.840> part<00:07:23.530> of<00:07:23.620> you<00:07:23.800> in<00:07:23.949> that

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
inevitably a part of you in that

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.189 
inevitably a part of you in that
character<00:07:24.539> there's<00:07:25.539> also<00:07:25.719> a<00:07:25.870> lot<00:07:26.169> of

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
character there's also a lot of

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.439 
character there's also a lot of
differences<00:07:27.099> especially<00:07:27.370> in<00:07:27.819> a<00:07:27.879> show<00:07:28.090> that<00:07:28.330> is

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449 
differences especially in a show that is

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:33.220 
differences especially in a show that is
you<00:07:29.409> know<00:07:29.530> based<00:07:29.860> in

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.200 

and<00:07:33.770> that's<00:07:33.980> what<00:07:34.190> keeps<00:07:34.340> it<00:07:34.580> fun

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
and that's what keeps it fun

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.730 
and that's what keeps it fun
yeah<00:07:37.210> I<00:07:37.240> think<00:07:37.450> that's<00:07:37.840> that<00:07:38.110> character<00:07:38.560> will

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.600 
always be a part of me and I'll always

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.740 
always be a part of me and I'll always
be<00:07:40.870> a<00:07:40.900> little<00:07:41.080> bit<00:07:41.260> part<00:07:41.530> of<00:07:41.620> her
