00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.629
 ah 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.269
 life is not fair will never be and 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.470
 nothing happens that's the way it has to be 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.680
 each being fighting for its survival 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.210
 life does not have to be fair because if 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 it would cease to exist 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.429
 it's just that a lion runs after a baby 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.820
 lamb and start devouring it before 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.910
 even that he is dead at all 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.890
 lamb would say it's not fair but the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 truth is that if the lion did not 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.739
 the whole world would cease to exist 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.210
 because for every time you feed yourself 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.360
 to live another being must have given his life 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.910
 first when you walk on the lawn 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.760
 when you put a flower in a vase 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.730
 when you disinfect your bathtub when 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.850
 you breathe other beings give their life in the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.729
 process 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.229
 and because millions of sperm 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.860
 they gave up the possibility of a life 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.080
 when the universe decided that you should 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 live 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.780
 life is as it should be, although not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.690
 We always like it but not always we 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.150
 It seems fair and although sometimes it hurts more 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.150
 of what we consider sufficient 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.470
 what sense does it have then to fight for 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.030
 nothing 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.010
 well maybe none or maybe all 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.040
 the lamb would surrender without trying 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.460
 survive life would also leave 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.340
 exist 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.000
 because life is that prolong our 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.930
 existence all we can kill 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.020
 unintentionally or wanting to close his eyes 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 so as not to see the injustice that our 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 own existence supposed for the world 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.940
 whining for the unfairness of the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.740
 life with us 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.320
 any attempt to eliminate the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.530
 injustice of the world is useless but not 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.530
 we have no choice but to try 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 uselessly 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.250
 because it's the only thing we can do 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.819
 because from time to time we find a 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.519
 injustice without reason to be 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.790
 one that should be suppressed and that 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.260
 injustice always has the same name 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.720
 cruelty 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.879
 and we managed to suppress an injustice 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.549
 concrete derivative of cruelty and 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.579
 then we feel we can change the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:43.720
 world that we can eliminate equally 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:47.010
 all the other injustices but not only 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.409
 cruelty can be eliminated 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 and the world would continue to be a place 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.620
 immensely unfair and even without it 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.540
 and life would still be the greatest 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.170
 injustice 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.160
 an irremediable injustice a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.340
 beautifully irremediable injustice 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.990
 and now it happens that when I 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.080
 I strengthen you feel weak 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.920
 When you get rich, I feel 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.760
 poor when I magnify you 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.800
 You feel small when you win 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.260
 I feel like I lost 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.200
 that is the real injustice 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.900
 the one who tries to subtract strength from 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.659
 subtract wealth from subtracting greatness to 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.600
 who is fortunate to have them and 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.110
 all in the name of justice 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:49.030
 in favor of those who feel weak and poor 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:54.240
 small in comparison and still life 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.240
 she is beautiful unjustly beautiful
