00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 to me 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.870
 well now let's prepare a 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.090
 seedbed of corn in this case will be 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.890
 the mini pop is a variety corn 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.690
 tiny small for our 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.910
 balconies is perfect 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.740
 we need an alveolus tray one 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.960
 valve a little big we're going to make a 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.239
 seedbed and from here when I grow up I have 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.489
 a size of about 15 20 centimeters what 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 we will go to the definitive container 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.290
 well here we have the corn seed 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.680
 then what we are going to do is first 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.540
 with an ideal substrate for seedbeds 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.660
 made with peat and with a little 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.580
 of organic matter we will fill the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.990
 alveoli tray in this case I'm going to 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.449
 to 8 years will be enough 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.640
 you remember that you do not have to think 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.520
 the substrate but it is totally 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.060
 filling 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.810
 the alveoli 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.250
 once filled what we will do is catch 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.250
 the seed one by one 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.040
 and we put it in the tray in the center 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.940
 to be able to be light finger touch 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.940
 we put a little 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.670
 this is a corn that is delicious for 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.759
 make it raw in salads lightly 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.490
 Fried or cook it a tad okay but this 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.429
 it is an incredible corn to grow in 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.730
 our balcony for its size and for 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.850
 eat it with a flavor 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.120
 great because nothing covers a little bit the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.010
 seed and often you know what you have 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.390
 I do watering 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.390
 well, we continue to cultivate 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.939
 you know this technique how to cultivate 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.819
 potatoes on your balcony with a simple 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.459
 jute bag a little bit of substrate and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.530
 some seed potatoes nothing then I 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.780
 I'm here with my potatoes, I say goodbye 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.780
 you good harvest for all
