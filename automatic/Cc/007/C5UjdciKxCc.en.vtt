design team yeah what kind of sports car

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.770 
design team yeah what kind of sports car
do<00:00:09.520> you<00:00:09.610> think<00:00:09.760> we<00:00:09.910> should<00:00:10.090> be<00:00:10.210> building<00:00:10.570> and

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
do you think we should be building and

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.600 
do you think we should be building and
the<00:00:11.410> design<00:00:11.710> team<00:00:11.740> came<00:00:12.160> back<00:00:12.370> with<00:00:12.520> the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
the design team came back with the

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.490 
the design team came back with the
concept<00:00:13.090> that<00:00:13.330> wowed<00:00:13.660> the<00:00:13.960> public<00:00:14.350> at<00:00:14.470> the

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
build it there's just one proviso we

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.130 
build it there's just one proviso we
want<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:21.850> actual<00:00:22.180> car<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.690> look<00:00:22.810> like<00:00:22.990> the

want the actual car to look like the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.710 
want the actual car to look like the
concept<00:00:23.560> car<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:24.010> for<00:00:24.520> once<00:00:24.760> that's<00:00:25.570> what

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
concept car and for once that's what

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.050 
concept car and for once that's what
happened<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.740> public<00:00:27.100> saw<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.310> concept<00:00:27.820> car

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
happened the public saw the concept car

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.660 
happened the public saw the concept car
loved<00:00:28.510> it<00:00:28.690> said<00:00:29.020> build<00:00:29.289> it<00:00:29.440> for<00:00:29.650> us<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.010> that's

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
loved it said build it for us and that's

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.309 
loved it said build it for us and that's
what<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:30.939> public<00:00:31.119> got<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:32.109> TT<00:00:32.320> coupe<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:34.319> when

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:35.319 
what the public got the TT coupe a when

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.989 
what the public got the TT coupe a when
they<00:00:35.409> set<00:00:35.589> out<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.890> design<00:00:36.069> the<00:00:36.429> TT<00:00:36.819> they

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
they set out to design the TT they

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.360 
they set out to design the TT they
decided<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.539> start<00:00:37.929> with<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.319> wheels<00:00:38.679> which

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
decided to start with the wheels which

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.590 
decided to start with the wheels which
is<00:00:39.519> logical<00:00:39.940> enough<00:00:40.149> they<00:00:40.329> are<00:00:40.449> quite

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
is logical enough they are quite

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.419 
is logical enough they are quite
important<00:00:41.109> on<00:00:41.229> a<00:00:41.260> car<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.769> then<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.219> sort<00:00:42.370> of

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
important on a car and then to sort of

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.430 
important on a car and then to sort of
stretch<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:42.969> bodywork<00:00:43.539> over<00:00:43.960> them<00:00:44.109> they'll

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
stretch the bodywork over them they'll

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.139 
stretch the bodywork over them they'll
tell<00:00:44.679> you<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:45.010> it's<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.460> case<00:00:45.639> of<00:00:45.699> form

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
tell you that it's a case of form

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
more than that in fact but then this is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.740 
more than that in fact but then this is
emphatically<00:01:31.870> not<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.650> hooligan<00:01:33.280> car<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:34.090> is<00:01:34.510> a

emphatically not a hooligan car it is a

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.050 
emphatically not a hooligan car it is a

very very good-looking car that also

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.990 
very very good-looking car that also
happens<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.720> drive<00:01:37.960> rather<00:01:38.230> well<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.920> sure<00:01:39.610> you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
happens to drive rather well to sure you

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.060 
happens to drive rather well to sure you

so<00:04:17.680> we<00:04:17.830> have<00:04:18.040> one<00:04:18.820> plane<00:04:19.359> going<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:19.959> way

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
so we have one plane going this way

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.840 
so we have one plane going this way
that's<00:04:20.650> intersected<00:04:21.220> by<00:04:21.250> everything<00:04:21.609> else
