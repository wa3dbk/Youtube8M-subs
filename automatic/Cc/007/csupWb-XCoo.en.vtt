00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
in this workshop I'll show you how to

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.080 
in this workshop I'll show you how to
make<00:00:07.680> your<00:00:07.919> own<00:00:08.099> beaded<00:00:08.580> beads<00:00:08.820> using

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
make your own beaded beads using

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.690 
make your own beaded beads using
Swarovski<00:00:09.360> crystals<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.710> take<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> look<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
Swarovski crystals so take a look at the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.820 
Swarovski crystals so take a look at the
beaded<00:00:12.000> bead<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> earrings<00:00:13.049> this

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
beaded bead here on the earrings this

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.169 
beaded bead here on the earrings this
will<00:00:14.009> give<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> little<00:00:14.460> taste<00:00:14.759> for<00:00:15.000> what

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
will give you a little taste for what

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.609 
will give you a little taste for what
I'm<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> show<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.900> how<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.560> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I'm going to show you how to do and you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
I'm going to show you how to do and you
won't<00:00:16.770> believe<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.190> easy<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.789> now<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.660> can

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
won't believe how easy it is now you can

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.470 
won't believe how easy it is now you can
use<00:00:19.140> any<00:00:19.410> size<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.949> bicone<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
use any size of bicone so I have a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.790 
use any size of bicone so I have a
couple<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
couple here that you can see the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
couple here that you can see the
difference<00:00:23.130> between<00:00:23.340> tiny<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.390> 3

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
difference between tiny little 3

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.349 
difference between tiny little 3
millimeter<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.410> 6<00:00:26.099> millimeter<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.210> could

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
millimeter and 6 millimeter you could

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.300 
millimeter and 6 millimeter you could
use<00:00:27.599> smaller<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.199> could<00:00:28.320> use<00:00:28.500> larger<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.160> can

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
use smaller you could use larger you can

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
use smaller you could use larger you can
use<00:00:29.490> 4<00:00:29.730> millimeter<00:00:30.090> which<00:00:30.330> would<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
use 4 millimeter which would be in the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
use 4 millimeter which would be in the
middle<00:00:31.289> there<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.980> make<00:00:32.130> sure<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> when

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
middle there just make sure that when

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
middle there just make sure that when
you<00:00:32.640> choose<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.059> beading<00:00:33.420> wire<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
you choose your beading wire the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.479 
you choose your beading wire the
diameter<00:00:34.440> will<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.710> able<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> pass<00:00:35.160> through

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
diameter will be able to pass through

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.299 
diameter will be able to pass through
the<00:00:35.579> beads<00:00:35.790> several<00:00:36.239> times<00:00:36.800> ok<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.070> begin

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the beads several times ok so to begin

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880 
the beads several times ok so to begin
you<00:00:39.149> cut<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> piece<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.780> wire<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.530> 12

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you cut a piece of wire that's about 12

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.459 
you cut a piece of wire that's about 12
inches<00:00:41.070> long<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.600> recommend<00:00:43.110> starting

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
inches long and I recommend starting

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
inches long and I recommend starting
with<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.860> 13<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.370> Oh<00:00:44.610> 15<00:00:45.180> wire<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.840> you'll<00:00:46.350> want

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
with a 13 or Oh 15 wire and you'll want

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
with a 13 or Oh 15 wire and you'll want
to<00:00:46.620> use<00:00:46.739> 49<00:00:47.309> strand<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> most

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to use 49 strand because it's the most

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.950 
to use 49 strand because it's the most
flexible<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> first<00:00:50.520> step<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.660> string

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
flexible so the first step is to string

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.540 
flexible so the first step is to string
four<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.949> bicones

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
four of the bicones

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
four of the bicones
onto<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> wire<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> add

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
onto the wire and you don't need to add

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
onto the wire and you don't need to add
a<00:00:56.039> stopper<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.360> careful<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.020> you're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a stopper just be careful when you're

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
a stopper just be careful when you're
stringing<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.250> slide<00:00:59.579> off

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
stringing so that they don't slide off

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.760 
stringing so that they don't slide off
the<00:00:59.879> other<00:01:00.000> end<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.989> we'll<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.410> working

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the other end because we'll be working

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.060 
the other end because we'll be working
with<00:01:01.800> both<00:01:02.160> ends<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> wire<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
with both ends of the wire so for the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
with both ends of the wire so for the
first<00:01:05.369> stitch<00:01:05.939> you'll<00:01:06.840> string<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> four

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
first stitch you'll string the four

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.700 
first stitch you'll string the four
beads<00:01:07.830> onto<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.369> wire<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.560> you'll

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
beads onto the wire and then what you'll

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.240 
beads onto the wire and then what you'll
do<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.130> position<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.439> beads<00:01:14.070> in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
do is position them with the beads in

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.960 
do is position them with the beads in
the<00:01:14.340> center<00:01:14.810> okay<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:15.990> bring<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.520> up<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the center okay then bring one up a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
the center okay then bring one up a
little<00:01:18.299> bit<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.320> access<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
little bit so that you can access the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.789 
little bit so that you can access the
hole<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> just

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
hole and it's up for that is to just

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
hole and it's up for that is to just
hold<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> against<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.340> finger<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> wrap<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
hold it against your finger and wrap the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.969 
hold it against your finger and wrap the
wire<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> catch<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:25.890> other

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
wire back and catch it with your other

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
wire back and catch it with your other
finger<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> hole<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> exposed<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
finger so that the hole is exposed and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
finger so that the hole is exposed and
you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.040> pass<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.310> wire<00:01:29.700> through<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.150> other

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you can pass your wire through the other

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can pass your wire through the other
end<00:01:32.030> all<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.689> pull<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.170> end

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
end all right and then you pull your end

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.999 
end all right and then you pull your end
even<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.000> carefully<00:01:36.540> hold<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> ends<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
even so just carefully hold the ends and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
even so just carefully hold the ends and
slide<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.759> bead<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:39.020> using<00:01:40.020> very<00:01:40.200> light

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
slide the bead down using very light

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
slide the bead down using very light
tension<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.850> you'll<00:01:41.970> adjust<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
tension and you'll adjust that so that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
tension and you'll adjust that so that
it's<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> center<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.310> wire<00:01:44.549> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it's right in the center of your wire so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's right in the center of your wire so
you<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.530> looks<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.600> okay<00:01:48.600> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you have what looks like this okay so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.310 
you have what looks like this okay so
the<00:01:48.930> next<00:01:49.110> step<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.310> add<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.759> bead<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:52.049> each

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the next step is to add one bead to each

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.280 
the next step is to add one bead to each
side<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.600> show<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
side and this will show you how the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.120 
side and this will show you how the
pattern<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.430> developing<00:01:58.130> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
pattern is going to start developing so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
pattern is going to start developing so
add<00:01:59.369> two<00:01:59.610> each<00:01:59.759> side<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:01.619> add<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.869> again

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
add two each side and then add one again

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
add two each side and then add one again
this<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.040> pass

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
this will be the one that we pass

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.700 
this will be the one that we pass
through<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.820> side<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> I'll<00:02:07.500> catch<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
through the other side so I'll catch it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.620 
through the other side so I'll catch it
with<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.069> finger<00:02:08.780> pass<00:02:09.780> through

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
with my finger pass through

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.630 
with my finger pass through
all<00:02:12.410> right<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.830> you're<00:02:12.980> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.460> this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
all right so you're going to do this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.660 
all right so you're going to do this
pull<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.270> down<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.830> see<00:02:16.040> how<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.430> two

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
pull it down and see how I have two

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.540 
pull it down and see how I have two
stitches<00:02:16.940> there<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.710> also<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.040> great<00:02:19.310> way

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
stitches there this is also a great way

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.030 
stitches there this is also a great way
to<00:02:19.700> give<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.600> little<00:02:20.810> practice<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.500> doing

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
to give the little practice to doing

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.380 
to give the little practice to doing
some<00:02:22.220> bead<00:02:22.370> work<00:02:22.550> if<00:02:22.700> you've<00:02:22.850> never<00:02:22.970> tried<00:02:23.210> it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
some bead work if you've never tried it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.430 
some bead work if you've never tried it
before<00:02:23.710> so<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:24.950> two<00:02:25.220> stitches<00:02:25.910> there

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
before so you have two stitches there

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.290 
before so you have two stitches there
okay<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.010> piece<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.640> left<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.120> little

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
okay so on this piece I left it a little

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.970 
okay so on this piece I left it a little
bit<00:02:29.480> loose<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.320> see<00:02:30.530> here's<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
bit loose so that you can see here's the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.730 
bit loose so that you can see here's the
first<00:02:31.220> stitch<00:02:31.720> here's<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.990> second<00:02:33.410> one

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
first stitch here's the second one

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.210 
first stitch here's the second one
here's<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.580> third<00:02:34.820> one<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:36.440> you're<00:02:36.860> going<00:02:37.100> to

bead I'm sorry a fourth finish this add
another<00:02:45.350> bead<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:46.070> finish<00:02:46.340> your<00:02:46.490> fourth

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
another bead to finish your fourth

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.480 
another bead to finish your fourth
stitch<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.990> just<00:02:48.200> adjust<00:02:48.680> everything<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.370> that

point you're just going to add another

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.060 
point you're just going to add another
bead<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:02.090> each<00:03:02.300> end<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.960> wire<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.470> then

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
bead to each end of the wire and then

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.820 
bead to each end of the wire and then
we'll<00:03:04.280> be<00:03:04.400> ready<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.670> stitch<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.560> pass

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
we'll be ready to stitch it up so pass

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.180 
we'll be ready to stitch it up so pass
through<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.490> bead<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:07.970> each<00:03:08.000> wire<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.190> then

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
through a bead on each wire and then

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.970 
through a bead on each wire and then
I'll<00:03:10.550> show<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.790> how<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.180> folds<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:12.530> bring<00:03:12.830> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
I'll show you how it folds you bring the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.420 
I'll show you how it folds you bring the
wire<00:03:13.160> ends<00:03:13.700> through<00:03:14.540> each<00:03:14.870> side<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:16.190> that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
wire ends through each side of that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.150 
wire ends through each side of that
first<00:03:16.820> bead<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.990> you<00:03:18.050> stitch<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:20.200> then<00:03:21.200> you

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
first bead that you stitch and then you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.560 
first bead that you stitch and then you
fold<00:03:22.460> it<00:03:22.640> kind<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:22.970> into<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.270> little<00:03:23.570> tube<00:03:24.440> and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
fold it kind of into a little tube and

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.200 
fold it kind of into a little tube and
then<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.690> pull<00:03:26.930> everything<00:03:27.350> tight<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:28.250> you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
then you pull everything tight and you

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.880 
then you pull everything tight and you
want<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.480> be<00:03:29.720> gentle<00:03:29.960> when<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.230> do<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.590> but

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
want to be gentle when you do that but

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.500 
want to be gentle when you do that but
you<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.160> see<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.490> it<00:03:31.610> makes<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.970> bead<00:03:32.180> shape

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
you can see that it makes a bead shape

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.780 
you can see that it makes a bead shape
and<00:03:32.780> see<00:03:33.200> how<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.500> forms<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.890> little<00:03:34.100> star<00:03:34.400> here

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
and see how it forms a little star here

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.330 
and see how it forms a little star here
on<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.360> side<00:03:35.570> this<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.870> where<00:03:36.170> you'll<00:03:36.950> string

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
on the side this is where you'll string

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.080 
on the side this is where you'll string
it<00:03:37.520> okay<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:39.459> want<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.520> be<00:03:40.610> sure<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.790> show<00:03:41.030> you

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
it okay so I want to be sure to show you

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.240 
it okay so I want to be sure to show you
my<00:03:41.270> samples<00:03:41.720> but<00:03:41.900> what<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.320> would<00:03:42.470> do<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:42.890> pass

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
my samples but what you would do is pass

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.690 
my samples but what you would do is pass
this<00:03:43.520> wire<00:03:43.820> all<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.209> way<00:03:44.570> around<00:03:45.020> this<00:03:45.980> part

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
this wire all the way around this part

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.520 
this wire all the way around this part
of<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.030> bead<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.990> you<00:03:48.140> just<00:03:48.350> add<00:03:48.500> a

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
of the bead and then you just add a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.710 
of the bead and then you just add a
little<00:03:48.620> bit<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.070> glue<00:03:49.340> let<00:03:49.940> it<00:03:50.060> dry<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:50.660> then

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
little bit of glue let it dry and then

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.900 
little bit of glue let it dry and then
cut<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.560> wire<00:03:51.709> ends<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.550> we'll<00:03:52.670> have<00:03:52.820> the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
cut the wire ends and we'll have the
