there last night at a kid just pipped
which<00:01:48.409> basically<00:01:48.890> means<00:01:49.219> it<00:01:49.479> slid<00:01:50.479> open<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
which basically means it slid open and

these are the eggs out of the 14 100 it
was<00:01:54.829> 14<00:01:55.729> or<00:01:55.819> 15<00:01:56.179> I'll<00:01:56.270> remember<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.689> exact

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
was 14 or 15 I'll remember the exact

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.130 
was 14 or 15 I'll remember the exact
number<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.250> dragon<00:01:58.670> laid<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.929> was<00:02:00.049> her

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
number that the dragon laid it was her

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.719 
number that the dragon laid it was her
first<00:02:00.319> clutch<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:00.920> I'm<00:02:01.039> kind<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.310> surprised

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
first clutch so I'm kind of surprised

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.949 
first clutch so I'm kind of surprised
that<00:02:02.349> they're<00:02:03.349> even<00:02:03.619> any<00:02:03.979> hatching<00:02:04.459> but<00:02:04.959> these

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
that they're even any hatching but these

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.680 
that they're even any hatching but these
are<00:02:06.170> all<00:02:06.349> the<00:02:06.530> bad<00:02:06.740> eggs<00:02:07.099> that<00:02:07.849> well<00:02:08.269> I<00:02:08.479> don't

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
are all the bad eggs that well I don't

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.600 
are all the bad eggs that well I don't
know<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:08.869> they're<00:02:09.049> bad<00:02:09.200> yet<00:02:09.649> completely<00:02:10.220> 100%

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
know if they're bad yet completely 100%

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.380 
know if they're bad yet completely 100%
but<00:02:11.590> that's<00:02:12.590> what<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.190> think<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.970> have<00:02:14.150> my

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
but that's what I think I have my

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.960 
but that's what I think I have my
humidity<00:02:15.049> gauge<00:02:15.200> here<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:16.040> little

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
humidity gauge here and it's a little

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.610 
humidity gauge here and it's a little
over<00:02:17.209> 70<00:02:17.629> and<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:20.540> actually<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.110> bunch<00:02:21.470> of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
over 70 and I have actually a bunch of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.319 
over 70 and I have actually a bunch of
water<00:02:21.829> in<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.250> bottom<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.849> tray<00:02:23.120> if<00:02:23.239> you

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
water in the bottom and that tray if you

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.420 
water in the bottom and that tray if you
can<00:02:23.510> see<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.810> there<00:02:24.049> that's<00:02:24.950> filled<00:02:25.340> with

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
can see that there that's filled with

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.610 
can see that there that's filled with
water<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:26.299> little<00:02:26.569> troughs<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.379> it<00:02:27.470> looks

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
water in little troughs and it looks

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.020 
water in little troughs and it looks
like<00:02:27.769> it<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.099> made<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.519> way<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.879> can

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
like it they made it that way so you can

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
like it they made it that way so you can
probably<00:02:29.269> stack<00:02:29.599> some<00:02:29.810> more<00:02:29.930> containers<00:02:30.379> on

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
