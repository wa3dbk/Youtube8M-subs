that you know the first signs of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.429 
that you know the first signs of
durability<00:01:40.250> i'm<00:01:40.520> starting<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:40.909> see<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:42.290> can

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
durability i'm starting to see you can

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.270 
durability i'm starting to see you can
kind<00:01:42.649> of<00:01:42.680> see<00:01:42.890> right<00:01:43.220> there<00:01:44.950> we<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:46.100> like

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
kind of see right there we have like

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.609 
kind of see right there we have like
something<00:01:46.579> like<00:01:46.729> leathers<00:01:47.320> kind<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.380> start<00:01:48.530> an

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
like I watched other videos and people

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.600 
like I watched other videos and people
ask<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.500> time<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.950> compare<00:02:54.220> legend

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
ask all the time to compare legend

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.440 
ask all the time to compare legend
forest<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.239> control<00:02:56.140> 360<00:02:56.680> tues<00:02:57.209> yet<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.299> haven't

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
forest to control 360 tues yet I haven't

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.870 
forest to control 360 tues yet I haven't
really<00:02:58.690> seen<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.959> happen<00:02:59.319> and<00:02:59.530> I<00:03:00.370> used<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.700> have

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
really seen it happen and I used to have

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.610 
really seen it happen and I used to have
the<00:03:01.000> tools<00:03:01.239> but<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.510> return<00:03:01.900> them<00:03:02.079> for<00:03:02.110> sizing

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
the tools but I return them for sizing

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.509 
the tools but I return them for sizing
issues<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:05.049> have<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.530> ones<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.130> they

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
issues so I I do have the ones and they

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.280 
issues so I I do have the ones and they
are<00:03:06.700> really<00:03:07.090> really<00:03:07.450> really<00:03:07.690> similar<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
are really really really similar to the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.289 
are really really really similar to the
tools<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:08.769> there's<00:03:08.950> hardly<00:03:09.940> any<00:03:10.090> difference

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
tools like there's hardly any difference

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.270 
tools like there's hardly any difference
so<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.500> think<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.709> comparison<00:03:12.250> between

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
so if you think a comparison between

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.800 
so if you think a comparison between
these<00:03:12.640> two<00:03:12.880> boots<00:03:13.150> would<00:03:13.269> be<00:03:13.420> pretty<00:03:13.660> good

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
these two boots would be pretty good

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.199 
these two boots would be pretty good
then<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.319> know<00:03:14.440> let<00:03:14.680> me<00:03:14.709> know<00:03:14.910> other<00:03:15.910> thing<00:03:16.090> i

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
then you know let me know other thing i

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.350 
then you know let me know other thing i
can<00:03:16.390> do<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:16.750> i<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.400> fair<00:03:18.849> amount<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.150> match

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
can do is i have a fair amount of match

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.210 
can do is i have a fair amount of match
balls<00:03:19.660> i<00:03:19.870> could<00:03:20.019> do<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.140> match<00:03:20.410> ball<00:03:20.680> like

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
balls i could do a match ball like

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.270 
balls i could do a match ball like
