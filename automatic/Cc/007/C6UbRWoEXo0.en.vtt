surgery and orthopedic surgery is
actually<00:00:18.390> greatly<00:00:18.930> needed<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:20.189> just

actually greatly needed and not just

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.830

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
a year and it is around the same as

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.889 
a year and it is around the same as
deaths<00:00:56.399> from<00:00:56.789> hiv/aids<00:00:57.539> malaria

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
at the cast room today and I learned how

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
at the cast room today and I learned how
to<00:01:19.259> put<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.470> splints<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:19.979> casts<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to put on splints and casts and so I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.469 
to put on splints and casts and so I
actually<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.350> am<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
actually I am I put on so this is a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually I am I put on so this is a
splint<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.150> injured

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
splint and so I'm not actually injured

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.550 
splint and so I'm not actually injured
but<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> learned<00:01:28.290> how<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> splint<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
but I learned how to put on a splint and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
but I learned how to put on a splint and
the<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.979> called<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> long<00:01:32.490> long<00:01:33.329> arm

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the this is called a long long arm

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
the this is called a long long arm
splint<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.909> actually

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
splint it's from the it's it's actually

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
splint it's from the it's it's actually
hard<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> way<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.100> mid<00:01:38.280> palm

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
hard here all the way to the mid palm

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.050 
hard here all the way to the mid palm
region<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.320> good<00:01:40.320> four<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> have

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
region and for good four of you have

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
region and for good four of you have
injuries<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.329> intra<00:01:42.750> articular<00:01:42.899> area<00:01:43.560> all

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
injuries in the intra articular area all

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
injuries in the intra articular area all
the<00:01:43.770> way<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> forearm<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> difference

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the way to the forearm so the difference

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
the way to the forearm so the difference
between<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.680> splint<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.790> cast<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
between a splint and a cast is the so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.130 
between a splint and a cast is the so
splint<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.409> probably<00:01:52.590> hear<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:54.140> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
splint if you can probably hear me it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.800 
splint if you can probably hear me it's
it's<00:01:55.500> hard<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> plaster<00:01:57.119> but

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it's hard here so this is a plaster but

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
it's hard here so this is a plaster but
you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> also<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.530> fiberglass<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.490> it's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you can also use fiberglass but it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.910 
you can also use fiberglass but it's
soft<00:01:59.969> right<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.719> cast<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.320> hard<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
soft right here a cast is hard all the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
soft right here a cast is hard all the
way<00:02:01.950> around<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> splint<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.479> use<00:02:03.570> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
way around and so a splint to use for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.120 
way around and so a splint to use for
initial<00:02:04.170> injury<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.649> you're<00:02:04.770> worried<00:02:05.100> about

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
initial injury if you're worried about

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.880 
initial injury if you're worried about
swelling<00:02:05.909> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
swelling and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.249 
swelling and
so<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:08.880> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.270> open<00:02:09.660> wounds

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so for if your if you have open wounds

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
so for if your if you have open wounds
right<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.730> don't<00:02:12.030> want<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> cover

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
right here and you don't want to cover

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.000 
right here and you don't want to cover
it<00:02:12.600> up<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.900> cast<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:13.410> that's<00:02:13.650> when<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it up with a cast then that's when you

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.040 
it up with a cast then that's when you
would<00:02:14.100> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.340> use<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.490> splint<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.900> was

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
would want to use a splint so that was

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.630 
would want to use a splint so that was
it<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.319> lot<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> fun<00:02:16.770> learning<00:02:17.160> how<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> put

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it was a lot of fun learning how to put

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.390 
it was a lot of fun learning how to put
on<00:02:17.700> splints<00:02:18.209> braces<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.990> another<00:02:19.950> thing<00:02:20.069> I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
on splints braces and another thing I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.630 
on splints braces and another thing I
learned<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.900> calmly<00:02:22.680> affecting<00:02:23.160> people

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
learned was the calmly affecting people

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.560 
learned was the calmly affecting people
are<00:02:23.850> ankle<00:02:24.330> sprains<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.459> ankle<00:02:26.459> sprains<00:02:26.850> you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
are ankle sprains so ankle sprains you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.540 
are ankle sprains so ankle sprains you
don't<00:02:27.750> actually<00:02:27.900> need<00:02:28.140> usually<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.459> an

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
don't actually need usually to get an

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120 
don't actually need usually to get an
expert<00:02:29.940> often<00:02:30.450> times<00:02:30.690> x<00:02:31.050> rays<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.590> overused

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
expert often times x rays are overused

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.460 
expert often times x rays are overused
and<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> only<00:02:33.360> times<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.780> need<00:02:34.020> an<00:02:34.200> x-ray

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and so the only times you need an x-ray

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.790 
and so the only times you need an x-ray
when<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.070> an<00:02:35.190> ankle<00:02:35.489> spray<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.989> you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
when you have an ankle spray is when you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.070 
when you have an ankle spray is when you
if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.459> trouble<00:02:38.640> bearing<00:02:39.390> weight<00:02:39.630> for

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
if you have trouble bearing weight for

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.290 
if you have trouble bearing weight for
more<00:02:40.290> than<00:02:40.440> four<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.310> four<00:02:41.550> steps<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.209> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
more than four for four steps so if you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.880 
more than four for four steps so if you
step<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.720> four<00:02:42.930> steps<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.410> can't<00:02:43.680> put

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
step for four steps and you can't put

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.650 
step for four steps and you can't put
weight<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.160> your<00:02:44.520> ankle<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.420> you're<00:02:45.570> going

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
weight on your ankle then you're going

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.880 
weight on your ankle then you're going
to<00:02:45.720> need<00:02:46.019> likely<00:02:46.980> an<00:02:47.100> x-ray<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.440> if

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
to need likely an x-ray and if you if

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.860 
to need likely an x-ray and if you if
you<00:02:50.070> touch<00:02:50.310> around<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.030> ankle<00:02:51.330> region<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you touch around the ankle region and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.220 
you touch around the ankle region and
you<00:02:52.260> palpate<00:02:52.670> along<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.850> bone<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.900> hurts

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
you palpate along the bone if that hurts

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
you palpate along the bone if that hurts
there's<00:02:55.860> bone<00:02:56.100> tenderness<00:02:56.489> then<00:02:56.850> you're

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
there's bone tenderness then you're

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.670 
there's bone tenderness then you're
going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> need<00:02:57.420> x-ray<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.440> than<00:02:58.620> that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
going to need x-ray but other than that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.890 
going to need x-ray but other than that
you<00:02:58.890> don't<00:02:59.040> need<00:02:59.190> an<00:02:59.310> x-ray<00:02:59.519> you<00:03:00.450> likely<00:03:00.870> don't

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you don't need an x-ray you likely don't

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.170 
you don't need an x-ray you likely don't
need<00:03:01.230> an<00:03:01.320> x-ray<00:03:01.730> those<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.850> called<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
need an x-ray those are called the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.580 
need an x-ray those are called the
Ottawa<00:03:03.570> rules<00:03:04.310> Ottawa<00:03:05.310> ankle<00:03:05.880> rules<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:07.019> if

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
Ottawa rules Ottawa ankle rules so if

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.520 
Ottawa rules Ottawa ankle rules so if
you<00:03:08.130> do<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.340> an<00:03:08.670> ankle<00:03:08.940> sprain<00:03:09.530> obviously

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
you do have an ankle sprain obviously

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.350 
you do have an ankle sprain obviously
you<00:03:10.769> want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.190> rest<00:03:11.519> ice<00:03:11.790> compress<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
you want to rest ice compress and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
you want to rest ice compress and
elevate<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:12.870> another<00:03:13.079> thing<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.650> learned

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
elevate but another thing I learned

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.610 
elevate but another thing I learned
today<00:03:14.400> was<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.820> often<00:03:15.600> doctors<00:03:16.440> will

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
today was that often doctors will

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.640 
today was that often doctors will
recommend<00:03:17.070> putting<00:03:17.280> using<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.360> boot<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> hard

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
recommend putting using a boot so a hard

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.500 
recommend putting using a boot so a hard
cast<00:03:19.980> food<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.820> goes<00:03:20.910> all<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.180> way<00:03:21.329> up<00:03:21.480> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
cast food that goes all the way up to

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.960 
cast food that goes all the way up to
your<00:03:21.720> knee<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.410> print<00:03:23.250> your<00:03:23.310> ankle<00:03:23.790> for

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
your knee and print your ankle for

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.430 
your knee and print your ankle for
moving<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.450> ways<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.630> are<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.019> hurt<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
moving in ways that are going to hurt it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.580 
moving in ways that are going to hurt it
more<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.579> that<00:03:26.720> often<00:03:27.720> helps<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.230> get

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
more and so that often helps you get

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.459 
more and so that often helps you get
your<00:03:28.769> ankle<00:03:29.130> better
