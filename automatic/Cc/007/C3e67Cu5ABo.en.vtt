 good to all here the ruby ​​that today 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.149
 I bring an unboxing from hk author before 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.830
 I did not want to thank you for all 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.510
 the questions that you have left in my 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.370
 previous video and on facebook the truth 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.990
 I'm very happy but the video 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.730
 of questions and answers will have to 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.560
 wait a while because until day 3 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.750
 February I'm with exams I'm very 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880
 busy so if I do not upload so many videos 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.619
 or do not answer so many comments I hope 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.660
 that you apologize me from 3 of 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.880
 February I will be very active and good 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.640
 be amazing so nothing we go with the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.210
 unboxing here in the background I have some 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.920
 Crazy type cubes we have the crazy 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.859
 diane tetrahedron and mc 8 the crazy mega 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.100
 mix also of diane and of mf 8 and one of 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.859
 my favorite cubes like no the crazy 4x4 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.350
 also diane and tmf 8 is a cube 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.959
 awesome that I love so 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.209
 nothing I think there should be a cube here 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:58.850
 crazy guy so we 're not going to open it 

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:00.319
 because I have a huge desire is 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.540
 almost open this package but hey 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.580
 I hope nothing has fallen 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.150
 here there should be a puzzle and a 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.650
 little thing more if you see the box you see 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.820
 he is very crazy is this is crazy the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 let's see it and what I was saying is two 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.130
 more pieces are for the deivid cube 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.110
 autostar vale is a cube that produced in 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.420
 mass calvin but that's good to me 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.560
 broke a piece you see here it's broken 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.950
 one of these small pieces and again 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.440
 and the cube is forgiveness is undone in 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.410
 a box you see here the core that is very 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.970
 special seems like a stop sign 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.070
 rotated pretty good is the school well 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.770
 but the bucket turned well but broke 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.990
 I do not know how it broke so nothing 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.970
 I ordered two more pieces to calvin and very 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.020
 kindly sent them to me so many 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.100
 thank you so we're not going for the puzzle 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.590
 you will see that here is information 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.300
 important it puts crazy me gaming that is 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.180
 this 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.119
 but it also puts crystal plus and we know 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.970
 what crystal refers to pyramid 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.610
 crystal and as there is no mf 8 are 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.590
 producing this crazy type cube 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.110
 and I'm going to buy it for sure because the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.820
 I love crazy guys and you'll see that 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.830
 it's a collection of best place cubes and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.650
 crystal plus and is the earth up 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.870
 March Mars is now not so ept one 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.110
 surely others will also be there and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.000
 well here is the mega mix so nothing 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.400
 mf 8 and diane likes crazy things 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.600
 all the credit types are yours so 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.070
 let's open it and well the puzzle is 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.350
 impressive and huge I already know why it 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.550
 Crazy flame as they have done is a puzzle 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.490
 so big let's see it 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.370
 it's huge is very very big we can 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.020
 compare it maybe with crushed ski 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.790
 which is the fattest cube that I have 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.830
 collection and you see that they are practically 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.450
 they have made it too big I do not know 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.910
 why they wanted to make it more cruel and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.850
 you still do not see are very similar in size 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.480
 so nothing we leave and we see that it is 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.760
 it's a crazy octahedron here I have his 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.370
 brother mike minor you see that it is much more 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.770
 tiny and good has grown and has 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.560
 come back a little you know not a little 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.700
 crazy turns around the faces I go here 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.620
 it has been blocked a bit 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.040
 it's just like this cube that revolves around 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.500
 to the faces but they have put circles 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.510
 like the other family of crazy cubes and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.200
 you see that they turn all the faces and they are 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.120
 pink they rotate very well a little bit hard 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.769
 maybe you have to publish it to improve 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 a little movement very well the face 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.989
 you want to tour very well and the blue also 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.700
 turns very well sometimes the town that was 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.430
 a little looks like these little tips 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.650
 but well let's see the colors here 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.250
 this very beautiful color a light blue 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.930
 pink yellow and orange pink look 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.790
 here look here that with a piece of 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.489
 plastic that comes out I do not like much 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.040
 I hope you can remove the pink tour 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.170
 pretty good and nothing is also done 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.060
 as I said by diane and by efe mf 8 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.099
 you see here on all the faces so what 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.709
 they put so we do not forget this 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.190
 cube is the venus cube and what does 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.560
 special 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.360
 well you will know the three by three types 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.420
 racing one of my likes in favorites 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.920
 this is the jupiter and well there are faces that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.410
 they stay still as for example the 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.500
 white face you see that if I raise this face 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.060
 it stays still 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.100
 but other faces like for example in the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.650
 yellow face that rotates as a 3 by 3 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.020
 normal for example if I turn here is 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.630
 common is for 3 good this makes it very 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.490
 complicated but I wanted the crazy 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.100
 octahedron that does not have that but that 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.530
 all the faces stay still and that 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.020
 it also makes it a very important challenge 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.740
 you see all of them stay still for example 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.979
 if we raise the orange here and turn 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.560
 to see exactly this structure is broken and 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.599
 it makes it very complicated so nothing 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.419
 I have a very incredible desire to 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.280
 solve this cube they say it is 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.199
 complicated because especially these 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.449
 tiny little triangles nobody knows how 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.240
 cycle the rotate them and good I hope 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.710
 discover a method that I like so 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.530
 nothing look how big this cube is 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.780
 compared to another crazy guy does not have 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.229
 comparison you do not see well standing and standing 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.139
 it's like the double were almost like the 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.599
 double so nothing will join your 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.729
 family of crazy type puzzles because the 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.699
 I really love them and I do not expect anything 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.889
 that when they take out the version of the crystal 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.599
 so I can buy it and 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.130
 that is very fun to solve well 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.069
 that nothing has been the unboxing of 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.870
 cube crazy octahedron forgiveness and nothing 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:36.699
 I hope you liked it and here 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.699
 we will be as always ruby that you
