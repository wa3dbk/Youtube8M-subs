some<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.620> barrier<00:01:51.220> where<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:51.940> most<00:01:52.150> of<00:01:52.240> your

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
some a barrier where is most of your

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.149 
some a barrier where is most of your
revenue<00:01:52.450> coming<00:01:52.810> from<00:01:52.930> right<00:01:53.140> now<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.010> it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
revenue coming from right now so it

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.830 
revenue coming from right now so it
right<00:01:54.280> now<00:01:54.430> seems<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:54.729> you're<00:01:55.000> getting<00:01:55.420> an

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
right now seems like you're getting an

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.840 
right now seems like you're getting an
essential<00:01:56.380> part<00:01:56.590> 4<00:01:57.070> part<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.370> your<00:01:57.520> business

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
for free essentially and I think it

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.770 
for free essentially and I think it
should<00:02:00.520> be<00:02:00.580> filtering<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.270> later<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.600> down<00:02:01.720> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
should be filtering it later on down the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.680 
should be filtering it later on down the
line<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:02.350> will<00:02:02.890> probably<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.729> pay<00:02:04.030> this

line you will probably have to pay this

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.230 
line you will probably have to pay this
is<00:02:04.840> really<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.170> kind<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.890> program<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:07.030> not
