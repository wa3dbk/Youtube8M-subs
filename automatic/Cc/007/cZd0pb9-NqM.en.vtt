up Lisa's hip shot up there a little bit

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.880 
up Lisa's hip shot up there a little bit
too<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.030> what<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.300> does<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:30.380> puts<00:01:30.800> your

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
too and what that does is it puts your

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.530
