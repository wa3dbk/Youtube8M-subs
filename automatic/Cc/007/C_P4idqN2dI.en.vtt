00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
comfy and when i start i think it might

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.650 
comfy and when i start i think it might
be<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.550> little<00:02:45.700> talent<00:02:46.150> at<00:02:46.239> imagine<00:02:46.600> he

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
be a little talent at imagine he

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.039 
be a little talent at imagine he
probably<00:02:46.870> has<00:02:47.140> more<00:02:47.170> action<00:02:47.709> than<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:52.049> okay

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049
