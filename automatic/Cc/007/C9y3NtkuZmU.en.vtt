00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello friends here so I'm showing 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 For you, the fuel tank of the van. 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.460
 gas canister and the detail I want 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.470
 show for you is about the little chair 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.560
 or bank, right? 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.810
 is a great difficulty in these models 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.840
 where the seat is the one with the highest spring 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.240
 to make an adaptation to not stay 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 an adaptation much waterfall to look for 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.030
 something but it's still beautiful 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.879
 I want to show you from the beginning 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.920
 so here is the stand of a wood 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.160
 and I'll show you more but then 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.370
 wood where you will put the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 Upholstered and it looks original is well 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.899
 cool, very comfortable, I think it's more 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.829
 comfortable that they old banks of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.899
 spring 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:09.380
 There the belts stay here is normal, right? 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:12.119
 the right way to get out 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.259
 carrying both people and cargo 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.670
 Because she ate it is neither mixed nor can she 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.990
 Passengers as the guy, then I will. 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.490
 I'll show you what to show you. 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:39.360
 Ok, so here it is already finalized then 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:40.759
 seat already in place with belts all 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.700
 right 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.360
 maintaining the originality without losing 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.390
 space ne 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.939
 I think so it was in my eyes was great 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.219
 even for the comfort that he used to 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:02.250
 used here to put the type era 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.369
 canvas used that it ends up 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.810
 a lot of dirt and I chose to leave this 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.479
 visual cleaner 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.690
 interesting detail 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.010
 this here is no dirt on grease was 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.190
 administered inside the pens and 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.190
 look how nice it is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:32.220
 I did not get grease and that was not what the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
 minister was her former owner at 12 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.670
 years ago 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.879
 which I'm very happy to have 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.599
 done that we can observe there 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:46.950
 also behind the door there that there 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.750
 everything and grease really cool, huh? 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.959
