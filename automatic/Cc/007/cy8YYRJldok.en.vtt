too<00:02:39.380> good<00:02:39.680> let's<00:02:39.860> put<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.100> here<00:02:40.130> see<00:02:40.550> how<00:02:40.610> that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
too good let's put it here see how that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.390 
too good let's put it here see how that
sounds<00:02:46.870> not<00:02:47.870> bad<00:02:47.900> as<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.500> can<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.280> do

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
sounds not bad as you can see you can do

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.280 
sounds not bad as you can see you can do
quickly<00:02:49.580> here<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.660> also<00:02:50.810> add<00:02:50.989> some

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
quickly here you can also add some

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.640 
quickly here you can also add some
double<00:02:51.890> loops<00:02:52.040> right<00:02:52.220> here<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.420> this<00:02:54.410> may

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
double loops right here so if this may

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.170 
double loops right here so if this may
sound<00:02:54.920> good<00:02:55.070> actually<00:02:55.519> on<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> clap<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> let's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
sound good actually on the clap so let's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.410 
sound good actually on the clap so let's
add<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.480> right<00:02:59.510> here<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:04.030> get<00:03:05.030> those<00:03:05.239> two

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
add it right here you get those two

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.699 
add it right here you get those two
claps<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:06.080> without<00:03:06.380> adding<00:03:06.769> two<00:03:07.400> claps<00:03:14.709> so

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
claps going without adding two claps so

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.110 
claps going without adding two claps so
as<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.069> see<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.340> get<00:03:16.489> these<00:03:16.640> really<00:03:16.970> cool

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
as you can see you get these really cool

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360 
as you can see you get these really cool
effects<00:03:17.450> very<00:03:17.840> quickly<00:03:18.079> very<00:03:18.200> easily<00:03:18.470> another

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
effects very quickly very easily another

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.390 
effects very quickly very easily another
quick<00:03:19.640> thing<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.970> want<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.269> show<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:21.400> that

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
quick thing I want to show you is that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000 
quick thing I want to show you is that
you<00:03:22.519> can<00:03:22.610> actually<00:03:22.760> randomize<00:03:23.720> everything<00:03:24.380> so

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
you can actually randomize everything so

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.860 
you can actually randomize everything so
it<00:03:25.340> could<00:03:25.489> run<00:03:25.640> through<00:03:25.820> their<00:03:26.329> algorithm<00:03:26.780> and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
it could run through their algorithm and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.400 
it could run through their algorithm and
just<00:03:26.989> do<00:03:27.079> track<00:03:27.350> random<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:29.209> it'll<00:03:30.049> give<00:03:30.260> you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
just do track random and it'll give you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.069 
just do track random and it'll give you
different<00:03:30.769> ideas<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.239> quickly<00:03:32.750> put

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
different ideas that you can quickly put

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.819 
different ideas that you can quickly put
into<00:03:33.230> your<00:03:33.320> track<00:03:35.470> that's<00:03:36.470> pretty<00:03:36.650> cool<00:03:38.829> then

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
into your track that's pretty cool then

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.300 
into your track that's pretty cool then
if<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:40.160> like<00:03:40.340> some<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.980> don't<00:03:43.130> like

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
if you just like some and you don't like

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.470 
if you just like some and you don't like
something<00:03:43.640> just<00:03:43.730> clear<00:03:44.000> up<00:03:44.030> them

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
something just clear up them

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:55.210 
something just clear up them
so<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.590> sounds<00:03:46.860> pretty<00:03:46.980> cool<00:03:47.250> right<00:03:47.400> there

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.560 

and<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.460> just<00:03:56.610> keep<00:03:56.730> randomizing<00:03:57.450> it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
and you can just keep randomizing it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.030 
and you can just keep randomizing it
until<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.020> find<00:03:58.260> something<00:03:58.440> like<00:03:58.560> start

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
until you find something like start

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.460 
until you find something like start
removing<00:03:59.400> stuff<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.880> go<00:04:00.270> from<00:04:00.450> there

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.800 

so<00:04:07.470> as<00:04:07.740> you<00:04:08.040> can<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.330> there's<00:04:09.540> many

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
so as you can see you can there's many

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.270 
so as you can see you can there's many
things<00:04:10.080> in<00:04:10.200> which<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.440> can<00:04:10.560> do<00:04:10.709> right<00:04:10.860> here<00:04:10.920> of

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
things in which you can do right here of

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.710 
things in which you can do right here of
course<00:04:11.310> there's<00:04:11.700> different<00:04:12.000> algorithms<00:04:12.480> to

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
course there's different algorithms to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.320 
course there's different algorithms to
do<00:04:12.900> track<00:04:13.260> random<00:04:13.709> space<00:04:14.670> whatever<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.180> want

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
do track random space whatever you want

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:39.760 
do track random space whatever you want
to<00:04:15.390> do<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.220> can<00:04:38.280> quickly<00:04:38.580> go<00:04:38.910> ahead<00:04:39.030> and

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
to do so you can quickly go ahead and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.550 
to do so you can quickly go ahead and
kind<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:41.720> quickly<00:04:42.720> add<00:04:42.840> these<00:04:42.990> cool<00:04:43.230> effects

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
kind of quickly add these cool effects

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.159 
kind of quickly add these cool effects
without<00:04:44.180> knowing<00:04:45.180> how<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.330> do<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.600> really<00:04:45.840> by

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
without knowing how to do it really by

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.500 
without knowing how to do it really by
hand<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.650> just<00:04:47.550> let<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.790> plug-in<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
hand and just let the plug-in do the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.659 
hand and just let the plug-in do the
work<00:04:48.660> for<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:49.080> it's<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.410> easy<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:49.919> it<00:04:50.520> gives

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
work for you it's so easy and it gives

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.360 
work for you it's so easy and it gives
you<00:04:50.820> incredible<00:04:51.030> effects<00:04:51.690> like<00:04:52.530> incredibly

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
you incredible effects like incredibly

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.550 
you incredible effects like incredibly
of<00:04:53.550> cool<00:04:54.150> effects<00:04:54.479> I'm<00:04:55.020> going<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.260> go<00:04:55.320> try<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
of cool effects I'm going to go try it

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.170 
of cool effects I'm going to go try it
on<00:04:55.680> another<00:04:55.890> track<00:04:56.220> right<00:04:56.460> here<00:04:56.490> let's<00:04:57.090> see

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
on another track right here let's see

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:11.899 
on another track right here let's see
how<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.360> sounds<00:04:57.750> let's<00:04:58.680> find<00:04:58.890> something<00:04:59.220> here

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.129 

so<00:05:12.909> hey<00:05:13.089> pop<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.509> just<00:05:13.539> use<00:05:13.809> this<00:05:13.930> type<00:05:14.110> of

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
so hey pop I just use this type of

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.110 
so hey pop I just use this type of
effect<00:05:15.569> tape<00:05:16.569> stop<00:05:16.809> effect<00:05:16.949> or<00:05:17.949> like<00:05:18.939> I<00:05:19.059> said

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
effect tape stop effect or like I said

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.249 
effect tape stop effect or like I said
you're<00:05:19.419> probably<00:05:19.539> going<00:05:19.779> to<00:05:19.870> want<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.110> use

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
you're probably going to want to use

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:28.739 
you're probably going to want to use
maybe<00:05:20.499> a<00:05:20.589> stutter<00:05:20.919> effect<00:05:21.099> right<00:05:21.490> here<00:05:27.749> so

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:28.749 
maybe a stutter effect right here so

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.019 
maybe a stutter effect right here so
that<00:05:28.779> is<00:05:29.139> basically<00:05:29.529> a<00:05:29.889> quick<00:05:30.189> demo<00:05:30.610> version

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
that is basically a quick demo version

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.939 
that is basically a quick demo version
of<00:05:31.059> what<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.389> can<00:05:31.539> do<00:05:31.689> with<00:05:32.020> loop<00:05:32.229> Raider<00:05:32.469> it's

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
of what you can do with loop Raider it's

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
and you're probably going to want to

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.239 
and you're probably going to want to
output<00:05:38.199> your<00:05:38.229> whole<00:05:38.439> song<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:38.889> then<00:05:38.979> kind<00:05:39.159> of

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:44.649 
cool little effects in your track to

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:46.139 
cool little effects in your track to
make<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:44.949> sound<00:05:45.069> more<00:05:45.279> dynamic<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.999> your

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
make it sound more dynamic to your
