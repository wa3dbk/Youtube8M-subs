distance now on this package they
recommend<00:01:19.580> growing<00:01:20.580> growing<00:01:21.119> different

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
recommend growing growing different

types<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.780> corn<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> 25<00:01:22.799> feet<00:01:23.070> away<00:01:23.400> from

types of corn up to 25 feet away from
each<00:01:23.820> other<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.259> don't<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.740> kind

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
each other if you don't have that kind

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.090 
each other if you don't have that kind
of<00:01:26.250> room<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.020> also<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.860> said

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
of room you can also like I said

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.039 
of room you can also like I said
separate<00:01:29.640> them<00:01:29.759> by<00:01:29.880> time<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
separate them by time like this is a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.280 
separate them by time like this is a
70-day<00:01:31.770> corn<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> could<00:01:33.240> plant<00:01:33.420> an<00:01:33.780> 80<00:01:34.020> or

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
70-day corn so you could plant an 80 or

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890 
70-day corn so you could plant an 80 or
100<00:01:34.650> day<00:01:34.829> corn<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.460> even<00:01:35.850> an<00:01:35.939> earlier<00:01:36.360> corn<00:01:36.750> if

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
100 day corn or even an earlier corn if

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
100 day corn or even an earlier corn if
you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> find<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:38.299> know<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> lot<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
you can find it I know there's a lot of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
you can find it I know there's a lot of
hybrids<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.590> 60<00:01:41.070> days<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
hybrids that are about 60 days so that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
hybrids that are about 60 days so that
way<00:01:44.759> they're<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.090> pollinating<00:01:45.869> at<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> same

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
way they're not pollinating at the same

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
way they're not pollinating at the same
time<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:48.270> seed<00:01:48.659> should<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.680> safe<00:01:50.399> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
time and your seed should be safe to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.170 
time and your seed should be safe to
save<00:01:51.799> if<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.100> saving<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.670> seat<00:01:53.880> then

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
save if you're not saving your seat then

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
save if you're not saving your seat then
you<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> worry<00:01:55.290> about<00:01:55.439> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you really don't have to worry about it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.819 
you really don't have to worry about it
because<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:57.570> should<00:01:57.750> taste<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
because this should taste the same it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.780 
because this should taste the same it
shouldn't<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> cross-pollination

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
shouldn't the cross-pollination

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
shouldn't the cross-pollination
shouldn't<00:02:00.390> affect<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> taste<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
shouldn't affect the taste of it it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
middle marker out you can see there's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.140 
middle marker out you can see there's
one<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.350> each<00:02:19.500> end<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.910> were<00:02:21.000> doing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
one on each end when we were doing

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.990 
one on each end when we were doing
smaller<00:02:21.660> roads<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.320> onions<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.860> garlic<00:02:23.010> we

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
smaller roads like onions and garlic we

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
smaller roads like onions and garlic we
put<00:02:24.300> another<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.650> another<00:02:25.860> one<00:02:26.070> that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
put another one we have another one that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.190 
put another one we have another one that
we<00:02:26.220> screw<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> center<00:02:27.210> would<00:02:27.780> put<00:02:28.020> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
we screw in the center would put you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.630 
we screw in the center would put you
could<00:02:28.380> actually<00:02:28.620> plant<00:02:28.950> corn<00:02:29.250> closer

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
could actually plant corn closer

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.310 
could actually plant corn closer
together<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.270> leave<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.600> marker<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.110> there

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
together and leave that marker in there

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.949 
together and leave that marker in there
but<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> growth<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.640> thick<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.600> hard<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
but the growth so thick that is hard to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.500 
but the growth so thick that is hard to
get<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.320> pick<00:02:34.500> them<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> we

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
get in to pick them that way so I we

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.940 
get in to pick them that way so I we
prefer<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.230> way<00:02:37.440> since<00:02:37.650> we're<00:02:37.830> not

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
prefer to do it this way since we're not

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.420 
prefer to do it this way since we're not
really<00:02:38.100> short<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> room<00:02:39.950> hey<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.130> plant

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
really short on the room hey we plant

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.810 
really short on the room hey we plant
corn<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:42.480> four<00:02:42.840> inches<00:02:43.200> apart<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.760> just

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
corn about four inches apart so you just

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.880 
corn about four inches apart so you just
drop<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.420> seed<00:02:46.040> about<00:02:47.040> every<00:02:47.280> four<00:02:47.489> inches<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
drop a seed about every four inches and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.490 
drop a seed about every four inches and
then<00:02:49.890> cover<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.459> little<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.880> soil

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
then cover it with a little bit of soil

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.620 
then cover it with a little bit of soil
if<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.970> trouble<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.390> birds

they're<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.209> coming<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.650> put<00:02:58.830> it

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
they're just coming up you can put it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.220 
they're just coming up you can put it
netting<00:02:59.280> over<00:02:59.459> top<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.420> your<00:03:00.720> garden<00:03:01.020> patch

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230

until they're up a few inches and then

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.410 
until they're up a few inches and then
the<00:03:03.600> birds<00:03:03.780> won't<00:03:03.989> bother<00:03:04.230> them<00:03:05.300> but<00:03:06.300> I've

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
the birds won't bother them but I've
