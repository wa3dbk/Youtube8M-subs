your footage let's take a look at a few

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.380 
your footage let's take a look at a few
of<00:00:52.909> these<00:00:55.269> an<00:00:57.460> asterisk<00:00:58.460> next<00:00:58.549> to<00:00:58.909> one<00:00:59.150> of<00:00:59.180> the

of these an asterisk next to one of the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.030 
of these an asterisk next to one of the
numbers<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.930> a<00:00:59.960> polite<00:01:00.320> note<00:01:00.559> from<00:01:00.739> sugar

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
numbers is a polite note from sugar

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.590 
numbers is a polite note from sugar
effects<00:01:01.400> saying<00:01:01.729> that<00:01:01.909> this<00:01:02.150> distortion

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
effects saying that this distortion

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.539 
effects saying that this distortion
takes<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:03.049> little<00:01:03.350> more<00:01:03.470> horsepower<00:01:03.860> than<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
takes a little more horsepower than the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.100 
takes a little more horsepower than the
rest<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.479> might<00:01:05.570> take<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.810> little<00:01:05.990> while

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
rest so it might take a little while

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:38.050 
rest so it might take a little while
longer<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.710> render<00:01:07.010> I<00:01:35.560> like<00:01:36.560> number<00:01:36.859> 23<00:01:37.549> as<00:01:37.700> its

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
longer to render I like number 23 as its

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.789 
longer to render I like number 23 as its
geometry<00:01:38.359> looks<00:01:38.869> good<00:01:39.140> with<00:01:39.350> my<00:01:39.499> city

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
auto animate checkbox is checked so it's

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.099 
auto animate checkbox is checked so it's
doing<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.499> animation<00:01:49.130> automatically<00:01:49.759> if

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
doing the animation automatically if

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.840 
doing the animation automatically if
unchecked<00:01:51.109> I<00:01:51.649> could<00:01:51.950> do<00:01:52.039> it<00:01:52.159> manually<00:01:52.549> with

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
unchecked I could do it manually with

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.270 
unchecked I could do it manually with

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
keyframes in the distortion menu but I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.950 
keyframes in the distortion menu but I
like<00:01:55.520> things<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.850> be<00:01:55.939> easy<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.539> i'll<00:01:56.630> keep<00:01:56.810> it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
like things to be easy so i'll keep it

change<00:02:01.789> my<00:02:01.850> begin<00:02:02.509> time<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.380> animation

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
change my begin time so the animation

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.099 
change my begin time so the animation
