00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
sheathing system so first off I've got

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.130 
sheathing system so first off I've got
the<00:01:10.140> 22<00:01:11.130> Hawks<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> made<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.600> shading

prototype<00:01:26.299> sheathing<00:01:27.299> system<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
prototype sheathing system here this is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.649 
prototype sheathing system here this is
for<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.460> i<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.210> our<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.600> the

like I said it's apply wood frames
quarter<00:01:44.250> inch<00:01:44.450> since<00:01:45.450> real<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.840> fairly<00:01:46.140> thin

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
quarter inch since real it's fairly thin

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
quarter inch since real it's fairly thin
fairly<00:01:47.040> thin<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> maintains<00:01:47.909> strength

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
fairly thin but it maintains strength

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.830 
fairly thin but it maintains strength
and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.369> don't<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.670> come<00:01:50.840> as

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and then I don't know if it's come as

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.139 
and then I don't know if it's come as
far<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> somewhat<00:01:53.430> treated<00:01:53.850> so

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
far as i know it is somewhat treated so

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.670 
far as i know it is somewhat treated so
you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.409> just

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you know it's not going to really just

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.039 
you know it's not going to really just
rot<00:01:56.270> completely<00:01:57.270> basically<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:57.869> how<00:01:57.960> I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
rot completely basically that's how I

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.560 
rot completely basically that's how I
designed<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.759> hang<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.390> belt

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
designed it to be to hang off your belt

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.899 
designed it to be to hang off your belt
and<00:02:00.840> slide<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.350> out

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
and slide in and out

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.499 
and slide in and out
fairly<00:02:02.719> easily<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.939> was<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.210> prototype

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
fairly easily like this was a prototype

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.509 
fairly easily like this was a prototype
and<00:02:06.079> then<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.350> other<00:02:06.469> one<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.679> used<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:07.880> be<00:02:08.110> but

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
and then the other one I used to be but

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.699 
and then the other one I used to be but
demands<00:02:10.519> are<00:02:10.789> fairly<00:02:11.000> nice<00:02:11.440> every<00:02:12.440> once<00:02:12.500> a

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
demands are fairly nice every once a

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.559 
demands are fairly nice every once a
while<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:12.860> mean<00:02:13.190> they<00:02:13.849> don't<00:02:14.120> get<00:02:14.299> on<00:02:14.390> catch

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
while I mean they don't get on catch

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.869 
while I mean they don't get on catch
like<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> catch<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.590> snag<00:02:15.890> when<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.220> work<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.730> work

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
like a catch a snag when I work I work

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.210 
like a catch a snag when I work I work
fairly<00:02:17.269> hard<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.810> kind<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.319> get<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> good

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
fairly hard of this kind of get a good

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.330 
fairly hard of this kind of get a good
prototype<00:02:19.760> design<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.900> i<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.069> i<00:02:22.099> mean<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
prototype design and i like it i mean it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.640 
prototype design and i like it i mean it
keeps<00:02:22.549> at<00:02:22.819> least<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.180> keeps<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.540> safe<00:02:24.379> from

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
keeps at least it keeps you safe from

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.979 
keeps at least it keeps you safe from
the<00:02:25.400> blade<00:02:25.640> anything<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.269> that<00:02:26.299> from<00:02:26.660> harm

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
the blade anything like that from harm

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.780 
the blade anything like that from harm
and<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.769> one<00:02:27.890> has<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.069> tech<00:02:28.370> locks<00:02:28.549> so<00:02:28.760> you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and this one has the tech locks so you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.910 
and this one has the tech locks so you
can<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:29.000> easily<00:02:29.360> easily<00:02:30.290> take<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.830> off

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
can just easily easily take that off

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.350 
can just easily easily take that off
your<00:02:31.069> belt<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:31.489> go<00:02:31.760> ahead<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:31.970> do<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.060> real

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
quick yeah so just like that slides in

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.550 
quick yeah so just like that slides in
and<00:02:37.519> then<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:38.299> buckles<00:02:38.690> clip<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.440> way<00:02:39.530> I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
and then the buckles clip in the way I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.170 
and then the buckles clip in the way I
hope<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.829> buckles<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.280> them<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.610> put<00:02:40.819> some<00:02:40.970> like

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
hope the buckles on them I put some like

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.360 
hope the buckles on them I put some like
rivet<00:02:41.540> holes<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.019> then<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.709> put<00:02:43.010> some<00:02:43.129> screws

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
rivet holes and then I put some screws

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.460 
rivet holes and then I put some screws
to<00:02:43.700> attach<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.239> then<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.930> added<00:02:45.079> this<00:02:45.230> piece

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
to attach that then I added this piece

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.170 
to attach that then I added this piece

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
people would have with the sheathing

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.860 
people would have with the sheathing
system<00:03:13.459> like<00:03:13.579> this<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:14.329> was<00:03:14.540> also<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
system like this this was also the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.819 
system like this this was also the
plywood<00:03:15.440> i<00:03:15.650> used<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.900> time<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> texture<00:03:18.500> spray

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
plywood i used a time a texture spray

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.710 
plywood i used a time a texture spray
paint<00:03:19.099> i<00:03:19.250> was<00:03:19.430> debating<00:03:19.639> on<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.269> treating

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
paint i was debating on just treating

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.420 
paint i was debating on just treating
the<00:03:20.750> wood<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.230> maybe<00:03:21.440> staining<00:03:21.919> it<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.220> I

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
the wood and maybe staining it but I

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.520 
the wood and maybe staining it but I
just<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.329> texture<00:03:23.690> feel<00:03:24.019> of<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.349> it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
just I like the texture feel of this it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.080 
just I like the texture feel of this it
kind<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.739> gives<00:03:24.859> it<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.099> kydex<00:03:25.519> sort<00:03:25.819> of<00:03:25.910> feel

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
kind of gives it a kydex sort of feel

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.000 
kind of gives it a kydex sort of feel
and<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.620> pain<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:27.859> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
and I really like the pain of the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.979 
and I really like the pain of the
buckles<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.639> think<00:03:29.359> this<00:03:29.450> works<00:03:29.660> pretty<00:03:29.840> well

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
buckles I think this works pretty well

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.620 
buckles I think this works pretty well
its<00:03:30.230> got<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.519> patek<00:03:31.519> lock<00:03:31.730> on<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.000> back<00:03:32.180> if

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
its got the patek lock on the back if

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.809 
its got the patek lock on the back if
it's<00:03:33.230> just<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:34.340> know<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.579> looks

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
it's just like that you know it looks

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.520 
it's just like that you know it looks
bulky<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.569> i<00:03:35.599> think<00:03:35.959> i<00:03:36.109> don't<00:03:36.349> know<00:03:36.410> i<00:03:36.440> think

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
bulky but i think i don't know i think

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.650 
bulky but i think i don't know i think
it<00:03:36.829> looks<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.280> its<00:03:37.459> own<00:03:37.579> way<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:38.030> unique<00:03:38.389> and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
it looks in its own way is unique and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.809 
it looks in its own way is unique and
awesome<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.709> then<00:03:40.099> this<00:03:40.220> one<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.549> slides

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
awesome and then this one just slides

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.960 
awesome and then this one just slides
out<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.870> emphasize<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.440> real<00:03:42.650> easy<00:03:42.970> there

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
out this emphasize that real easy there

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.670 
out this emphasize that real easy there
easy<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.419> you<00:03:44.630> know<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:44.840> got<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.989> little<00:03:45.230> play

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
easy and you know it's got a little play

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.039 
easy and you know it's got a little play
but<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.549> know<00:03:46.639> it's<00:03:46.790> would<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.359> did<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.660> best<00:03:47.690> I

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
but you know it's would I did the best I

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.170 
but you know it's would I did the best I
could<00:03:48.079> with<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.430> that's<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:50.030> that's

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
could with it and that's just that's

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.430 
could with it and that's just that's
kind<00:03:50.419> of<00:03:50.450> how<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.569> works<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.930> we'll<00:03:51.290> just

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
kind of how it works and we'll just

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.289 
kind of how it works and we'll just
slide<00:03:51.620> right<00:03:51.680> out<00:03:51.889> of<00:03:52.040> there<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.579> would<00:03:53.180> be

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
slide right out of there and would be

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.839 
slide right out of there and would be
good<00:03:53.419> to<00:03:53.540> go<00:03:53.690> or<00:03:53.959> text<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.319> user<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.459> whatnot

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
good to go or text the user and whatnot

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.759 
good to go or text the user and whatnot
and<00:03:56.269> then<00:03:56.810> some<00:03:56.989> of<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.169> issues<00:03:57.290> someone

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
and then some of the issues someone

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.319 
and then some of the issues someone
would<00:03:57.919> have<00:03:58.099> with<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.340> sheath<00:03:58.579> like<00:03:58.849> this<00:03:59.090> is

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
would have with a sheath like this is

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.020 
would have with a sheath like this is
I'll<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.840> talk<00:04:00.019> about<00:04:00.310> well<00:04:01.310> first<00:04:01.549> off<00:04:01.730> it

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
I'll just talk about well first off it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.360 
I'll just talk about well first off it
it's<00:04:02.840> good<00:04:03.079> it's<00:04:03.260> good<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.709> protects<00:04:04.069> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
it's good it's good that it protects the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.860 
it's good it's good that it protects the
user<00:04:04.579> from<00:04:04.910> weather<00:04:05.120> when<00:04:05.450> they're<00:04:05.569> carrying

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
user from weather when they're carrying

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.199 
user from weather when they're carrying
it<00:04:06.019> something<00:04:06.919> like<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.430> gonna<00:04:07.700> gonna

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
it something like this is gonna gonna

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.090 
it something like this is gonna gonna
take<00:04:08.480> away<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:08.930> dexterity<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.709> some

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
take away like dexterity and some

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.820 
take away like dexterity and some
movement

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
movement

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.370 
movement
like<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.910> know<00:04:12.000> especially<00:04:12.120> with<00:04:12.390> running<00:04:12.840> or

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
like you know especially with running or

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.860 
like you know especially with running or
walking<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:14.240> Ronnie<00:04:15.240> I<00:04:15.420> don't<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.780> would

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
walking on Ronnie I don't think it would

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.990 
walking on Ronnie I don't think it would
be<00:04:15.960> an<00:04:16.049> issue<00:04:16.170> but<00:04:16.640> kind<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.670> like<00:04:17.820> maybe

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
be an issue but kind of like maybe

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.340 
be an issue but kind of like maybe
crouching<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.630> things<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.959> it's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
crouching and things like that it's

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.960 
crouching and things like that it's
gonna<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.769> know<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.130> got<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.370> extra<00:04:20.640> bulk

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
gonna you know you got that extra bulk

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.170 
gonna you know you got that extra bulk
there<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.019> kydex<00:04:22.470> kydex<00:04:23.160> is<00:04:23.340> also<00:04:23.670> in<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:23.880> stiff

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
there and kydex kydex is also in a stiff

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.400 
there and kydex kydex is also in a stiff
and<00:04:24.420> whatnot<00:04:24.690> when<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.960> wouldn't<00:04:25.170> have<00:04:25.320> as

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
and whatnot when you wouldn't have as

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.490 
and whatnot when you wouldn't have as
much<00:04:25.560> kite<00:04:25.800> action<00:04:26.160> but<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.480> think<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.230> think

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
much kite action but it I think I think

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.410 
much kite action but it I think I think
though<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.100> does<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.640> does<00:04:29.790> what<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.090> needs<00:04:30.120> to

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
though it does it does what it needs to

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.930 
though it does it does what it needs to
do<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.620> that's<00:04:31.860> what's<00:04:32.100> important<00:04:32.610> also

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
do and that that's what's important also

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.970 
do and that that's what's important also
you<00:04:33.000> know<00:04:33.180> could<00:04:33.390> be<00:04:33.480> safety<00:04:33.870> issue<00:04:34.020> if<00:04:34.350> you

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
you know could be safety issue if you

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.090 
you know could be safety issue if you
fail<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.670> this<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.390> know<00:04:36.590> you're<00:04:37.590> protected

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
fail on this you know you're protected

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.100 
fail on this you know you're protected
from<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.310> blade<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:39.090> also<00:04:39.270> uni<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.870> could

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
from the blade but also uni you could

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.410 
from the blade but also uni you could
could<00:04:40.620> receive<00:04:40.920> an<00:04:41.070> injury<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:41.490> from<00:04:41.790> just

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
could receive an injury just from just

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.760 
could receive an injury just from just
from<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.660> sheath<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.990> mean<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.230> be<00:04:43.260> honest<00:04:43.650> I

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
from the sheath I mean to be honest I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.730 
from the sheath I mean to be honest I
use<00:04:43.950> them<00:04:44.360> gorilla<00:04:45.360> gorilla<00:04:45.810> glue<00:04:46.230> glue<00:04:46.560> and

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
use them gorilla gorilla glue glue and

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.080 
use them gorilla gorilla glue glue and
this<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.040> probably<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.730> not<00:04:47.880> going<00:04:48.030> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
this is probably this is not going to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.910 
this is probably this is not going to
come<00:04:48.300> apart<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.810> can<00:04:49.020> tell<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.290> mean<00:04:49.440> list<00:04:49.710> I

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
come apart I can tell you I mean list I

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.260 
come apart I can tell you I mean list I
mean<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.280> can<00:04:50.430> read<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.670> over<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.970> truck

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
mean you can read it over the truck

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.660 
mean you can read it over the truck
maybe<00:04:51.600> but<00:04:52.290> if<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.500> fell<00:04:52.710> on<00:04:52.740> this<00:04:53.070> you're

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
maybe but if you fell on this you're

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:03.650 
maybe but if you fell on this you're
probably<00:05:01.430> make<00:05:02.430> any<00:05:02.580> mistakes<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.270> look

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
probably make any mistakes and you look

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.740 
probably make any mistakes and you look
really<00:05:03.930> good<00:05:04.850> good<00:05:05.850> luck<00:05:06.060> going<00:05:06.270> back<00:05:06.510> in<00:05:06.720> that

be nice to make kind of sheath out of
the<00:05:15.810> system<00:05:15.990> what<00:05:16.290> kind<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.500> like<00:05:16.650> that<00:05:16.890> just

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
the system what kind of like that just

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.800 
the system what kind of like that just
to<00:05:17.430> see<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.820> mean<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.000> think<00:05:18.090> it's<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.540> think<00:05:18.600> it
