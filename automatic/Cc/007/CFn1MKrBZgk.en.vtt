00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
think they're camera shy because they

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.910 
think they're camera shy because they
normally<00:03:51.660> come<00:03:51.690> right<00:03:52.080> up<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> door<00:03:52.740> and

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
they didn't come up to that door they do

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.880 
they didn't come up to that door they do
I<00:03:54.420> think<00:03:54.570> they're<00:03:54.720> camera<00:03:55.110> shy<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.620> what<00:03:58.830> are
