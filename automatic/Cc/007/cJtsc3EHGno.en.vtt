00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
areas of it

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.030 
areas of it
sure<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:17.080> there's<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> keti<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.739> about<00:02:17.920> it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
sure and there's a keti what about it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.430 
sure and there's a keti what about it
it's<00:02:18.430> easy<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.940> eye<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.900> it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
it's easy on the eye you know it it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.229 
it's easy on the eye you know it it
performs<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.970> then<00:02:22.090> the

performs so well and then the

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.780 
performs so well and then the
characteristic<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.080> engine<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.790> it's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
characteristic of the engine just it's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.140 
characteristic of the engine just it's
it's<00:02:25.269> what<00:02:25.510> sort<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.930> needed<00:02:26.580> put<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.730> hurt<00:02:27.940> you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
know for certain areas of the track but

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.120 
know for certain areas of the track but
there<00:02:30.700> you've<00:02:30.850> got<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.870> demands<00:02:32.260> needed<00:02:32.860> to
