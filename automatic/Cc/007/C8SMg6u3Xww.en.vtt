okay<00:00:02.550> so<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.149> want<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> zero<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.529> on

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
okay so what I want you to zero in on

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.980 
okay so what I want you to zero in on
first<00:00:05.549> are<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.720> runners<00:00:07.319> hips<00:00:08.750> right<00:00:09.750> in

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
first are this runners hips right in

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.540 
first are this runners hips right in
this<00:00:11.179> region<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:14.389> okay<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> right<00:00:17.310> foot

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
this region here okay so right foot

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090 
this region here okay so right foot
strikes<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.260> we're<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.770> measure<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
strikes and we're going to measure the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.550 
strikes and we're going to measure the
angle<00:00:20.430> here

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.929 

not<00:00:25.560> much<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.130> hip<00:00:26.279> drop<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.760> we're

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
not much of a hip drop there we're

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
not much of a hip drop there we're
talking<00:00:27.300> two<00:00:27.750> three<00:00:28.439> degrees<00:00:28.769> maybe<00:00:29.039> that's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
talking two three degrees maybe that's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.229 
talking two three degrees maybe that's
well<00:00:30.000> within<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.830> limit<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.550> we're<00:00:33.000> good<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
well within the limit so we're good to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.569 
well within the limit so we're good to
go<00:00:33.270> there<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.680> then<00:00:34.829> let's<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
go there and then let's look at the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.069 
go there and then let's look at the
other<00:00:35.790> side<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:37.700> not<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.760> much<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.809> mean

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
other side and not so much so I mean

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.569 
other side and not so much so I mean
just<00:00:40.200> eyeballing<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.040> tell<00:00:41.250> there's

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
just eyeballing it you can tell there's

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.180 
just eyeballing it you can tell there's
a<00:00:41.670> pretty<00:00:42.090> significant<00:00:42.840> difference<00:00:43.160> as<00:00:44.160> far

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
a pretty significant difference as far

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.330 
a pretty significant difference as far
as<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.149> left<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.340> let's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
as the the left to the right so let's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
as the the left to the right so let's
measure<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.789> angle<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.770> we're

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
measure this angle here and we're

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.619 
measure this angle here and we're
looking<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:53.780> 18<00:00:54.780> 19<00:00:55.079> degrees<00:00:55.789> maybe<00:00:56.789> 17<00:00:57.449> which

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
looking at 18 19 degrees maybe 17 which

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.380 
looking at 18 19 degrees maybe 17 which
is<00:00:57.809> way<00:00:58.410> too<00:00:58.469> much<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.670> indicative<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
is way too much so this is indicative of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
is way too much so this is indicative of
what's<00:01:00.629> called<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> Trendelenburg<00:01:01.590> gait<00:01:01.620> where

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
what's called a Trendelenburg gait where

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
what's called a Trendelenburg gait where
this<00:01:02.820> runners<00:01:03.149> gluteus<00:01:03.600> medius<00:01:03.809> which<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this runners gluteus medius which is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.560 
this runners gluteus medius which is
used<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> hip<00:01:05.189> stabilizer<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:06.270> stopped

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
used as a hip stabilizer has stopped

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
used as a hip stabilizer has stopped
firing<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.260> basically<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.340> runner<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
firing so basically this runner is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
firing so basically this runner is
running<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.570> very<00:01:09.840> low<00:01:10.080> stability<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
running on very low stability and as the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
running on very low stability and as the
miles<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.060> pick<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
miles really pick up is going to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
miles really pick up is going to
predispose<00:01:14.010> himself<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.210> overuse

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
predispose himself to to overuse

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.990 
predispose himself to to overuse
injuries<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> first<00:01:17.220> significant

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
injuries so that's the first significant

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.130 
injuries so that's the first significant
thing<00:01:18.150> we're<00:01:18.299> seeing<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.780> runners

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
thing we're seeing with this runners

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.330 
thing we're seeing with this runners
gait<00:01:20.299> next<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> focus<00:01:22.979> in

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
gait next thing I want you to focus in

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
gait next thing I want you to focus in
on<00:01:24.770> let<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:25.920> looking<00:01:26.220> at<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> region<00:01:28.710> here

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
on let me looking at this region here

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.260 
on let me looking at this region here
and<00:01:29.570> more<00:01:30.570> specifically<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:34.369> angle<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and more specifically the angle of this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
and more specifically the angle of this
runners<00:01:36.659> feet<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.890> he's<00:01:38.009> running

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
runners feet when when he's running

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:51.920 
runners feet when when he's running
through<00:01:38.490> his<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.970> gait<00:01:39.299> there

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:02.060 

so<00:01:52.930> first<00:01:53.560> his<00:01:53.920> left<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.050> can<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:56.350> here

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.710 

there's<00:02:03.070> not<00:02:03.460> much<00:02:03.790> internal<00:02:04.390> external

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
there's not much internal external

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.110 
there's not much internal external
rotation<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:05.530> pretty<00:02:05.830> much<00:02:06.100> straight<00:02:07.090> up

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
rotation it's pretty much straight up

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.330 
rotation it's pretty much straight up
and<00:02:07.360> down<00:02:07.390> which<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.810> what<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.080> want<00:02:08.350> okay

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and down which is what we want okay

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.230 
and down which is what we want okay
compared<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> other<00:02:10.479> side<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:16.000> so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
compared to the other side and not so

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:26.310 
compared to the other side and not so
much<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.690> measure<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.470> angle<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:25.320> we're

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
much to measure this angle here we're

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.370 
much to measure this angle here we're
looking<00:02:26.440> at<00:02:26.680> 15<00:02:27.160> 16<00:02:27.400> degrees<00:02:28.030> way<00:02:28.900> too<00:02:28.959> much

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
looking at 15 16 degrees way too much

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.630 
looking at 15 16 degrees way too much
let's<00:02:30.070> look<00:02:30.310> at<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> one<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:30.730> time<00:02:32.640> straight

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
let's look at it one more time straight

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:44.880 
let's look at it one more time straight
up<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.970> down<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:42.450> again<00:02:43.450> 15<00:02:43.720> 16<00:02:44.350> degrees<00:02:44.680> so

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
up and down and again 15 16 degrees so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.150 
up and down and again 15 16 degrees so
what<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.459> tells<00:02:45.670> us<00:02:45.820> is<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.630> runners

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
what this tells us is this runners

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.530 
what this tells us is this runners
internal<00:02:48.160> rotators<00:02:48.520> of<00:02:48.700> his<00:02:48.910> hip<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.330> more

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
internal rotators of his hip are more

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.660 
internal rotators of his hip are more
than<00:02:49.660> likely<00:02:49.720> very<00:02:50.350> tight<00:02:50.680> or<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> buildup

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
than likely very tight or have a buildup

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.420 
than likely very tight or have a buildup
of<00:02:51.820> adhesion<00:02:52.290> scar<00:02:53.290> tissue<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.130> aren't

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
of adhesion scar tissue and just aren't

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.530 
of adhesion scar tissue and just aren't
moving<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.910> they<00:02:55.060> should

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
moving like they should

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.259 
moving like they should
throughout<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.290> runners<00:02:56.620> gait<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.269> this

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
throughout this runners gait so this

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.270 
throughout this runners gait so this
told<00:02:58.540> us<00:02:58.690> all<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.260> needed<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.680> know<00:02:59.709> moving

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
told us all we needed to know moving

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.860 
told us all we needed to know moving
forward<00:03:00.640> as<00:03:00.730> far<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.000> giving<00:03:01.269> treatment

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
forward as far as giving treatment

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.660 
forward as far as giving treatment
recommendations<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.950> rehab

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
recommendations and rehab

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.580 
recommendations and rehab
recommendations<00:03:04.390> so<00:03:04.570> we're<00:03:05.140> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> switch

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
recommendations so we're going to switch

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.550 
recommendations so we're going to switch
over<00:03:05.800> here<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.330> right-hand<00:03:07.900> side<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
over here to the right-hand side of the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.160 
over here to the right-hand side of the
screen<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:09.850> this<00:03:10.330> next<00:03:10.540> video<00:03:10.840> was<00:03:10.989> taken

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
screen and so this next video was taken

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.039 
screen and so this next video was taken
two<00:03:12.160> days<00:03:12.190> after<00:03:13.180> we<00:03:13.420> did<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.840> initial

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
two days after we did the initial

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.470 
two days after we did the initial
assessment<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:14.890> let's<00:03:15.850> look<00:03:16.090> at<00:03:16.299> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
assessment and let's look at the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.690 
assessment and let's look at the
differences<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.989> were<00:03:17.320> made<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.799> off<00:03:18.220> two

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
differences that were made just off two

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:30.680 
differences that were made just off two
days<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.150> work

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.390 

okay<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:31.740> again<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:34.220> we're<00:03:35.220> going<00:03:35.340> to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
okay so again this we're going to

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.770 
okay so again this we're going to
compare<00:03:35.910> angles<00:03:36.870> here<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:38.070> if<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.370> remember

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
compare angles here so if you remember

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.340 
compare angles here so if you remember
previously<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:40.680> runner<00:03:41.010> had<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.580> 15<00:03:42.540> 16<00:03:43.140> 17

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
previously this runner had a 15 16 17

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.840 
previously this runner had a 15 16 17
degree<00:03:44.130> hip<00:03:44.430> tilt<00:03:44.760> just<00:03:45.800> having<00:03:46.800> them<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.220> some

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
degree hip tilt just having them do some

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.090 
degree hip tilt just having them do some
pretty<00:03:48.120> intense<00:03:48.570> gluteus<00:03:49.050> medius<00:03:49.260> activation

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
pretty intense gluteus medius activation

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.400 
pretty intense gluteus medius activation
strengthening<00:03:50.640> exercises<00:03:51.200> look<00:03:52.200> at<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
strengthening exercises look at the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.410 
strengthening exercises look at the
difference<00:03:52.770> there<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.130> two<00:03:53.580> days<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.000> we've

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
difference there in two days so we've

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.060 
difference there in two days so we've
dropped<00:03:54.660> ten<00:03:54.960> degrees<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.440> hip<00:03:55.620> drop<00:03:55.860> which

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
dropped ten degrees on hip drop which

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.130 
dropped ten degrees on hip drop which
tells<00:03:56.790> us<00:03:57.000> okay<00:03:57.270> this<00:03:57.420> runner<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.810> already

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
tells us okay this runner is already

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.310 
tells us okay this runner is already
running<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.280> lot<00:03:59.610> more<00:03:59.790> stable<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.420> very<00:04:01.110> happy

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
running a lot more stable so very happy

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.150 
running a lot more stable so very happy
to<00:04:01.500> see<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:02.810> next<00:04:03.810> thing<00:04:04.200> we<00:04:04.920> want<00:04:05.130> to

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
to see that next thing we want to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.850 
to see that next thing we want to
compare<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:06.380> how<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.850> feet<00:04:08.850> look<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.860> again

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
compare is how the feet look so again

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.060 
compare is how the feet look so again
left<00:04:11.640> side<00:04:11.880> goes<00:04:12.090> through<00:04:12.420> looks<00:04:12.810> good<00:04:13.970> and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
left side goes through looks good and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.770 
left side goes through looks good and
let's<00:04:17.070> look<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.580> what's<00:04:17.850> going<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.540> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
let's look at what's going on on the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.180 
let's look at what's going on on the
right<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.590> remember<00:04:19.830> on<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.040> other

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
right so if you remember on the other

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.830 
right so if you remember on the other
side<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:21.930> know<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.290> foot<00:04:25.130> rotated<00:04:26.130> out

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
side you know this foot rotated out

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.830 
side you know this foot rotated out
approximately<00:04:28.160> 15<00:04:29.160> 16<00:04:29.580> degrees<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.180> we've

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
approximately 15 16 degrees and we've

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.100 
approximately 15 16 degrees and we've
already<00:04:31.050> got<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.500> down<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.710> 10<00:04:32.070> degrees<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:33.110> not

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
already got it down to 10 degrees so not

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260 
already got it down to 10 degrees so not
perfect<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.940> tells<00:04:36.180> us

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
perfect but this is a this tells us

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.760 
perfect but this is a this tells us
we're<00:04:36.450> on<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.690> right<00:04:36.810> track<00:04:37.110> as<00:04:37.320> far<00:04:37.500> as<00:04:37.620> how

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
we're on the right track as far as how

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.050 
we're on the right track as far as how
we're<00:04:37.920> approaching<00:04:37.980> this<00:04:38.430> runner<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:38.880> again

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
we're approaching this runner and again

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.030 
we're approaching this runner and again
this<00:04:39.210> was<00:04:39.360> after<00:04:39.510> one<00:04:39.840> treatment<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.650> the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
this was after one treatment so that the
