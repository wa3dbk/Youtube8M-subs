hey<00:00:12.290> guys<00:00:12.500> it's<00:00:12.740> Greg<00:00:12.950> from<00:00:13.160> East<00:00:13.430> Coast<00:00:13.640> ice

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
hey guys it's Greg from East Coast ice

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.860 
hey guys it's Greg from East Coast ice
and<00:00:14.120> I'm<00:00:14.210> going<00:00:14.330> to<00:00:14.360> talk<00:00:14.480> to<00:00:14.600> you<00:00:14.660> a<00:00:14.690> little

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
and I'm going to talk to you a little

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.930 
and I'm going to talk to you a little
bit<00:00:15.020> about<00:00:15.140> the<00:00:15.410> theory<00:00:15.740> of<00:00:15.860> stringing<00:00:16.460> a<00:00:16.640> mid

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
bit about the theory of stringing a mid

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.000 
bit about the theory of stringing a mid
pocket<00:00:17.360> and<00:00:17.570> what<00:00:18.200> positions<00:00:18.619> would<00:00:18.800> be<00:00:18.860> good

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
pocket and what positions would be good

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.750 
pocket and what positions would be good
for<00:00:19.220> so<00:00:19.820> here<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.090> have<00:00:20.210> an<00:00:20.330> example<00:00:20.390> of<00:00:21.670> just<00:00:22.670> a

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
for so here I have an example of just a

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.600 
for so here I have an example of just a
generic<00:00:22.880> mid<00:00:23.300> pocket<00:00:23.690> you<00:00:24.170> can<00:00:24.320> see<00:00:24.560> where<00:00:25.520> the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
generic mid pocket you can see where the

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.609 
generic mid pocket you can see where the
ball<00:00:25.820> sit<00:00:26.180> will<00:00:26.390> be<00:00:26.509> directly<00:00:27.050> in<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:27.500> middle

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
ball sit will be directly in the middle

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.790 
ball sit will be directly in the middle
of<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:27.919> head<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.390> so<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.689> mid<00:00:30.080> pocket<00:00:30.500> kind<00:00:30.710> of

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
of the head and so a mid pocket kind of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.650 
of the head and so a mid pocket kind of
combines<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:31.310> best<00:00:31.520> of<00:00:31.700> both<00:00:31.759> worlds<00:00:31.939> it<00:00:32.480> has

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
combines the best of both worlds it has

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.180 
combines the best of both worlds it has
some<00:00:33.380> of<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.530> advantages<00:00:33.890> of<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.070> high

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
some of the advantages of the high

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.950 
some of the advantages of the high
pocket<00:00:34.700> while<00:00:35.300> having<00:00:35.630> some<00:00:35.810> of<00:00:35.870> the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
pocket while having some of the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.770 
pocket while having some of the
advantages<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.380> low<00:00:36.500> pocket<00:00:37.780> because

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
advantages of the low pocket because

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.000 
advantages of the low pocket because
it's<00:00:39.110> not<00:00:39.230> quite<00:00:39.500> as<00:00:39.620> high

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's not quite as high

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.190 
it's not quite as high
it<00:00:40.370> still<00:00:40.730> has<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.940> pretty<00:00:41.300> quick<00:00:41.600> release<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
it still has a pretty quick release the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.830 
it still has a pretty quick release the
ball<00:00:42.380> needs<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.740> go<00:00:42.920> from<00:00:43.070> here<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.580> get<00:00:44.510> out<00:00:44.660> so

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
ball needs to go from here to get out so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.120 
ball needs to go from here to get out so
it<00:00:44.930> has<00:00:45.080> a<00:00:45.110> relatively<00:00:45.560> quick<00:00:45.830> release

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
it has a relatively quick release

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.490 
it has a relatively quick release
without<00:00:46.790> having<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.660> added<00:00:47.780> whip<00:00:48.170> that

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
without having the added whip that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.800 
without having the added whip that
having<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:48.830> high<00:00:48.980> pocket<00:00:49.370> as<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:50.390> see<00:00:50.570> here

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
having a high pocket as you can see here

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.090 
having a high pocket as you can see here
because<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.230> pocket<00:00:51.590> sits<00:00:51.830> right<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.070> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
because the pocket sits right in the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.970 
because the pocket sits right in the
middle<00:00:52.190> there's<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.150> nice<00:00:53.470> gradual<00:00:54.470> ramp<00:00:54.710> for

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
middle there's a nice gradual ramp for

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.500 
middle there's a nice gradual ramp for
the<00:00:55.040> ball<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.340> come<00:00:55.430> Madeline<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.120> unlike<00:00:56.480> a

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
the ball to come Madeline so unlike a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.270 
the ball to come Madeline so unlike a
high<00:00:56.720> pocket<00:00:57.170> where<00:00:57.740> it<00:00:57.770> would<00:00:57.950> be<00:00:57.980> sitting

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
high pocket where it would be sitting

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.800 
high pocket where it would be sitting
all<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.520> way<00:00:58.580> up<00:00:58.670> here<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.150> have<00:00:59.480> a<00:00:59.570> very

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
all the way up here and have a very

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.540 
all the way up here and have a very
steep<00:01:00.170> incline<00:01:00.650> for<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:00.950> ball<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.250> flip<00:01:01.400> out

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
steep incline for the ball to flip out

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.149 
steep incline for the ball to flip out
on<00:01:02.020> hot<00:01:03.020> pocket<00:01:03.290> would<00:01:03.380> have<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.530> lot<00:01:03.740> more<00:01:03.770> whip

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
on hot pocket would have a lot more whip

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.370 
on hot pocket would have a lot more whip
but<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.299> get<00:01:05.509> you<00:01:05.750> still<00:01:06.020> get<00:01:06.170> some<00:01:06.200> of

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
but so you get you still get some of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.980 
but so you get you still get some of
that<00:01:06.500> quicker<00:01:06.830> release<00:01:07.090> while<00:01:08.090> having<00:01:08.570> less

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
that quicker release while having less

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.830 
that quicker release while having less
whip<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.560> more<00:01:09.770> manageable<00:01:10.130> shot<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:11.630> also

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
whip and a more manageable shot it also

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.999 
whip and a more manageable shot it also
has<00:01:12.020> some<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.380> advantage<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.799> low

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
has some of the advantage of the low

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.669 
has some of the advantage of the low
pocket<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:14.479> nice<00:01:14.689> thing<00:01:14.899> about<00:01:14.929> a<00:01:15.140> mid<00:01:15.320> pocket

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
pocket the nice thing about a mid pocket

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.789 
pocket the nice thing about a mid pocket
is<00:01:15.829> you<00:01:15.950> can<00:01:16.100> string<00:01:16.399> it<00:01:17.200> kind<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.259> adapt<00:01:18.560> it

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
is you can string it kind of adapt it

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.380 
is you can string it kind of adapt it
any<00:01:19.070> way<00:01:19.249> you<00:01:19.280> really<00:01:19.640> like<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:19.909> play<00:01:20.119> or<00:01:20.270> any

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
any way you really like to play or any

any way you really like to play or any
way<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.539> really<00:01:20.749> like<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.140> string<00:01:21.789> you<00:01:22.789> can

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
way you really like to string you can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.080 
way you really like to string you can
have<00:01:23.179> a<00:01:23.960> mid<00:01:24.560> pocket<00:01:25.039> that<00:01:25.460> when<00:01:25.609> you<00:01:25.670> cradle

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
have a mid pocket that when you cradle

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.050 
have a mid pocket that when you cradle
the<00:01:26.569> bowl<00:01:26.810> shift<00:01:27.229> down<00:01:27.409> low<00:01:27.649> like<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.060> when

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
the bowl shift down low like that when

the bowl shift down low like that when
you<00:01:29.119> put<00:01:29.299> it<00:01:29.390> in<00:01:29.479> one<00:01:29.630> hand<00:01:29.810> but<00:01:30.499> as<00:01:30.590> soon<00:01:30.740> as

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
you put it in one hand but as soon as

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.099 
you put it in one hand but as soon as
you<00:01:30.950> switch<00:01:31.159> back<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.399> two<00:01:31.670> hands<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.869> ball

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
you switch back to two hands the ball

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.480 
you switch back to two hands the ball
will<00:01:33.259> roll<00:01:33.439> right<00:01:33.499> back<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.130> middle<00:01:34.399> where

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
will roll right back to the middle where

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.620 
will roll right back to the middle where
you<00:01:34.579> want<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.850> sit<00:01:35.060> when<00:01:35.210> you're<00:01:35.329> cradling

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
you want to sit when you're cradling

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.020 
you want to sit when you're cradling
with<00:01:35.780> two<00:01:35.929> hands<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.159> in<00:01:37.490> order<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.850> do

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
with two hands and so in order to do

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.010 
with two hands and so in order to do
that<00:01:38.210> when<00:01:38.420> you're<00:01:38.509> stringing<00:01:38.780> your<00:01:38.899> mid

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
that when you're stringing your mid

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.770 
that when you're stringing your mid
pocket<00:01:39.409> what<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:39.979> would<00:01:40.219> do<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.639> just<00:01:41.179> add<00:01:41.359> one

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
pocket what I would do is just add one

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.230 
pocket what I would do is just add one
extra<00:01:42.020> diamond<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:42.859> here<00:01:43.280> at<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.460> bottom<00:01:43.490> so

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
extra diamond in here at the bottom so

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.969

down and then if you have soft an off
mesh<00:01:57.469> it<00:01:58.039> should<00:01:58.399> shift<00:01:58.639> right<00:01:58.909> back<00:01:59.119> up<00:01:59.329> when

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
mesh it should shift right back up when

pocket is you can have what I believe to

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.270 
pocket is you can have what I believe to
be<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.290> perfect<00:02:39.530> amount<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.920> channel

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
be just the perfect amount of channel

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.250 
be just the perfect amount of channel
you<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.120> see<00:02:41.299> here<00:02:41.480> are<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> channel<00:02:42.110> that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you can see here are the channel that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.830 
you can see here are the channel that
I'm<00:02:42.319> referring<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:43.340> how<00:02:43.610> tight<00:02:43.909> these

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
I'm referring to is how tight these

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.780 
I'm referring to is how tight these
sides<00:02:45.230> are<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.099> what<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.250> channel<00:02:46.640> does

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
sides are here and what a channel does

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.699 
sides are here and what a channel does
is<00:02:47.060> makes<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> ball<00:02:48.049> come<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.470> middle

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
is makes the ball come out the middle

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.180 
is makes the ball come out the middle
every<00:02:48.890> time<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.150> see<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.650> sides<00:02:51.920> here

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
every time so you can see the sides here

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.500 
every time so you can see the sides here
are<00:02:52.220> nice<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.609> tight<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.060> ball<00:02:53.209> come<00:02:53.390> out

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
are nice and tight so the ball come out

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.000 
are nice and tight so the ball come out
the<00:02:53.599> middle<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.349> what<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.590> want<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.920> a

allows<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:13.970> get<00:03:14.209> just<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.540> perfect<00:03:14.959> balls

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
allows you to get just a perfect balls

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.470 
allows you to get just a perfect balls
with<00:03:15.440> channel<00:03:15.829> while<00:03:16.459> maintaining<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.150> mid

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
with channel while maintaining that mid

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.430 
with channel while maintaining that mid
pocket<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.540> really<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:21.079> perfect

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
pocket and so really is just a perfect

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.069 
pocket and so really is just a perfect
all-around<00:03:21.790> pocket<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.909> I<00:03:22.970> recommend<00:03:23.450> for

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
all-around pocket that I recommend for

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.819 
all-around pocket that I recommend for
every<00:03:24.590> position<00:03:24.769> defense<00:03:25.639> midfield<00:03:26.239> attack

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
every position defense midfield attack

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.830 
every position defense midfield attack
and<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:28.459> would<00:03:28.609> say<00:03:28.790> it's<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> most<00:03:29.510> used

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
and I would say it's the most used

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.319 
and I would say it's the most used
pocket<00:03:30.200> placement<00:03:30.380> out<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:31.069> any<00:03:31.220> more<00:03:31.489> people

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
pocket placement out of any more people

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.720 
pocket placement out of any more people
have<00:03:32.959> mid<00:03:33.260> pockets<00:03:33.680> than<00:03:33.859> load<00:03:34.190> pockets<00:03:34.609> and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
have mid pockets than load pockets and

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.819 
have mid pockets than load pockets and
high<00:03:34.849> pockets<00:03:35.329> and<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.319> just<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.590> give<00:03:36.739> you

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
high pockets and so just to give you

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.039 
high pockets and so just to give you
guys<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:36.980> couple<00:03:37.250> quick<00:03:37.549> pointers<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.870> how

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
guys a couple quick pointers on how

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.599 
guys a couple quick pointers on how
exactly<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.739> would<00:03:39.859> go<00:03:40.010> about<00:03:40.129> stringing

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
exactly you would go about stringing

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.119 
exactly you would go about stringing
your<00:03:40.790> side<00:03:40.970> ball<00:03:41.209> for<00:03:41.389> a<00:03:41.419> mid<00:03:41.629> pocket<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:42.950> want

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
your side ball for a mid pocket you want

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.000 
your side ball for a mid pocket you want
to<00:03:43.220> pull<00:03:43.489> these<00:03:44.329> first<00:03:44.810> three<00:03:45.200> diamonds<00:03:45.560> of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
to pull these first three diamonds of

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.000 
to pull these first three diamonds of
the<00:03:46.190> mesh<00:03:46.400> down<00:03:47.180> very<00:03:47.569> very<00:03:47.690> tightly<00:03:48.139> so<00:03:48.470> you

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the mesh down very very tightly so you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.680 
the mesh down very very tightly so you
want<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.250> use<00:03:49.370> interlocks<00:03:49.879> or<00:03:50.150> knots<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.660> you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
want to use interlocks or knots and you

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.119 
want to use interlocks or knots and you
can<00:03:50.870> see<00:03:51.049> how<00:03:51.230> tight<00:03:51.500> those<00:03:51.680> holes<00:03:51.949> and

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
can see how tight those holes and

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.470 
can see how tight those holes and
measure<00:03:52.220> pulled<00:03:52.639> it's<00:03:53.060> going<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.269> make<00:03:53.359> sure

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
measure pulled it's going to make sure

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.000 
measure pulled it's going to make sure
there's<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.780> pooled<00:03:54.049> as<00:03:54.290> tight<00:03:54.530> as<00:03:54.650> they<00:03:54.739> can<00:03:54.889> go

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
there's a pooled as tight as they can go

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.089 
there's a pooled as tight as they can go
and<00:03:55.269> then<00:03:56.269> you<00:03:57.260> want<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.500> get<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.799> down<00:03:58.069> to

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
and then you want to get that down to

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.610 
and then you want to get that down to
about<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.519> third<00:03:59.060> maybe<00:03:59.930> even<00:04:00.230> close<00:04:00.440> to

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
about a third maybe even close to

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.960 
about a third maybe even close to
halfway<00:04:00.829> down<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.250> head<00:04:01.400> with<00:04:01.549> those<00:04:01.699> first

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
halfway down the head with those first

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.300 
halfway down the head with those first
three<00:04:02.180> diamonds<00:04:02.650> then<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.799> want<00:04:03.949> to<00:04:04.040> start<00:04:04.220> to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
three diamonds then you want to start to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.220 
three diamonds then you want to start to
loosen<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.699> Diamonds<00:04:05.060> up<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.269> little<00:04:05.419> bit<00:04:05.629> so

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
loosen the Diamonds up a little bit so

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.650 
loosen the Diamonds up a little bit so
you<00:04:06.319> can<00:04:06.379> do<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.829> one<00:04:07.160> interlock<00:04:07.639> which<00:04:08.540> is

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
you can do a one interlock which is

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.689 
you can do a one interlock which is
where<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.900> put<00:04:09.079> two<00:04:09.319> or<00:04:09.500> two<00:04:09.829> or<00:04:10.129> just<00:04:10.609> a

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
where you put two or two or just a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.250 
where you put two or two or just a
regular<00:04:11.030> one<00:04:11.180> where<00:04:11.359> you<00:04:11.449> put<00:04:11.599> two<00:04:11.810> holes<00:04:12.019> of

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
regular one where you put two holes of

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.390 
regular one where you put two holes of
mesh<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.239> same<00:04:15.010> between<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.220> same

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
mesh on the same between the same

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.920 
mesh on the same between the same
sidewall<00:04:16.820> hole<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.150> punch<00:04:17.449> them<00:04:17.660> up<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.810> little

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
sidewall hole so punch them up a little

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.020 
sidewall hole so punch them up a little
bit<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:18.979> that<00:04:19.099> I'll<00:04:19.220> loosen<00:04:19.519> a<00:04:19.609> little<00:04:19.880> bit

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
bit and so that I'll loosen a little bit

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.270 
bit and so that I'll loosen a little bit
and<00:04:20.959> then<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.229> want<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.410> loosen<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.739> even<00:04:22.070> more

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
and then you want to loosen it even more

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.790 
and then you want to loosen it even more
so<00:04:23.060> here<00:04:23.330> see<00:04:23.720> here<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:23.960> have<00:04:24.050> three<00:04:24.410> interlocks

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
so here see here I have three interlocks

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.620 
so here see here I have three interlocks
pulling<00:04:25.099> it<00:04:25.190> very<00:04:25.370> tightly<00:04:25.610> put<00:04:26.240> one<00:04:26.419> in<00:04:26.539> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
pulling it very tightly put one in the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.630 
pulling it very tightly put one in the
lock<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.050> then<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.650> triple<00:04:28.099> up<00:04:28.219> and<00:04:28.430> this

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
lock and then a triple up and this

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.100 
lock and then a triple up and this
triple<00:04:29.000> up<00:04:29.120> is<00:04:29.240> really<00:04:29.450> going<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.630> bunch<00:04:29.870> that

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
triple up is really going to bunch that

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.020 
triple up is really going to bunch that
mesh<00:04:30.349> together<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:31.340> can<00:04:31.460> see<00:04:31.669> where<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.849> did

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
mesh together you can see where I did

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.820 
mesh together you can see where I did
the<00:04:32.120> triple<00:04:32.330> up<00:04:32.479> right<00:04:32.630> here

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the triple up right here

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.830 
the triple up right here
is<00:04:32.920> right<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.400> middle<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.760> head<00:04:33.940> so

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
is right in the middle of the head so

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.780 
is right in the middle of the head so
wherever<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.290> double<00:04:35.590> up<00:04:35.710> or<00:04:35.800> triple<00:04:36.130> up<00:04:36.220> is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
wherever you double up or triple up is

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.860 
wherever you double up or triple up is
where<00:04:37.000> you're<00:04:37.120> really<00:04:37.240> going<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.510> bunch<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
where you're really going to bunch the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.810 
where you're really going to bunch the
mesh<00:04:38.020> together<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.650> create<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.340> pocket

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
mesh together and create that pocket

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.820 
mesh together and create that pocket
then<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.510> want<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.720> finish<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:41.020> out<00:04:41.170> with

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
then you just want to finish it out with

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.210 
then you just want to finish it out with
just<00:04:42.510> once<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.350> doesn't<00:04:44.650> get<00:04:44.740> too<00:04:44.890> deep<00:04:45.070> and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
just once so it doesn't get too deep and

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.800 
just once so it doesn't get too deep and
like<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.460> said<00:04:45.520> if<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.910> want<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.150> lower<00:04:46.330> pocket

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
like I said if you want a lower pocket

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.960 
like I said if you want a lower pocket
that'll<00:04:46.990> shift<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:47.890> add<00:04:48.190> another<00:04:48.400> one<00:04:48.790> in

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
that'll shift you can add another one in
