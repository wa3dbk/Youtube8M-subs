00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
let's go ahead and get started so first

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.110 
let's go ahead and get started so first
we<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.230> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> overview<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> home

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
map near the first spawn area and it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.700 
map near the first spawn area and it
just<00:00:43.320> looks<00:00:44.629> incredibly<00:00:45.629> different<00:00:46.170> from

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
just looks incredibly different from

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
just looks incredibly different from
black<00:00:47.010> cast<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.629> hadn't<00:00:48.930> told<00:00:49.079> us

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
black cast one so they hadn't told us

black cast one so they hadn't told us
that<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> remake<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.219> Stadium<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
that it was like a remake of Stadium I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.630 
that it was like a remake of Stadium I
probably<00:00:52.170> wouldn't<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.649> liked<00:00:52.949> known<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.520> at

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
probably wouldn't have liked known as at

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
probably wouldn't have liked known as at
all<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.090> take<00:00:54.629> off<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:55.020> reminds<00:00:55.590> me<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
all and take off actually reminds me a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.630 
all and take off actually reminds me a
lot<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> vertigo<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:59.160> probably<00:00:59.399> would

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
lot of vertigo and it probably would

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
lot of vertigo and it probably would
have<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.910> been<00:01:00.000> better<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.140> like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
have just been better to just have like

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
have just been better to just have like
kept<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> same<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.609> use<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> sort

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
kept it the same and just use it of sort

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
kept it the same and just use it of sort
of<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.320> futuristic<00:01:05.040> stadium<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of like a futuristic stadium as that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
of like a futuristic stadium as that
would<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.150> been<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.900> awesome<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
would have been really awesome and I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.240 
would have been really awesome and I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
through an underground passage but

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.950 
through an underground passage but
anyways<00:01:25.970> here's<00:01:26.970> another<00:01:27.390> popular<00:01:27.869> spot

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
anyways here's another popular spot

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
anyways here's another popular spot
maybe<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.100> map<00:01:32.280> near<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> other<00:01:32.790> spawn

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
maybe in the map near the other spawn

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.140 
maybe in the map near the other spawn
side<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.049> balcony<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.220> think

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
side in that balcony right there I think

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
side in that balcony right there I think
it's<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:36.780> important<00:01:37.229> spot<00:01:37.470> because

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's a really important spot because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.140 
it's a really important spot because
it's<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:39.890> near<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.490> flag<00:01:41.820> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's like right near the be flag so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
it's like right near the be flag so
usually<00:01:42.810> people<00:01:43.079> would<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
usually people would do they like just

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.359
