00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
leader but I'll be a deputy who is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
leader but I'll be a deputy who is
actually<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> leader<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> game<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
actually the leader but the game is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually the leader but the game is
confused<00:00:42.110> what<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.290> happens<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.130> that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
confused what this happens there is that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100 
confused what this happens there is that
if<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.000> ranked<00:00:45.420> match<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
if you do a ranked match in that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.799 
if you do a ranked match in that
scenario<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.790> able<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
scenario you will be able to get into a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.500 
scenario you will be able to get into a
right<00:00:49.079> match<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:50.040> your<00:00:50.220> own<00:00:50.460> group<00:00:50.910> without

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
right match with your own group without

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
right match with your own group without
having<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> find<00:00:52.230> anybody<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> other<00:00:53.130> side

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
having to find anybody on the other side

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.790 
having to find anybody on the other side
so<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.239> example<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.230> could<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> mixed

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so for example you could do a mixed

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760 
so for example you could do a mixed
species<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.520> people<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.260> friends<00:00:58.620> with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
species a people have three friends with

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520 
species a people have three friends with
you<00:00:58.950> do<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.730> glitch<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.629> you'll<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you do this glitch and you'll get to the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
you do this glitch and you'll get to the
match<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.390> host<00:01:03.629> or
