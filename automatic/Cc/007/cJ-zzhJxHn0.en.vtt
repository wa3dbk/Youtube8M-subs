action<00:01:51.999> is<00:01:52.299> you're<00:01:52.689> going<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.840> see<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.490> reason

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
action is you're going to see the reason

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.919 
action is you're going to see the reason
I'm<00:01:54.789> pointing<00:01:54.999> is<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.329> can<00:01:55.479> see<00:01:55.600> this<00:01:55.780> in<00:01:55.899> the

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
I'm pointing is I can see this in the

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.200 
I'm pointing is I can see this in the
camera<00:01:56.439> here<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:57.009> anyway<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.579> perimeter<00:01:58.179> of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
camera here but anyway the perimeter of

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.789 
camera here but anyway the perimeter of
your<00:01:58.270> hair<00:01:58.539> gets<00:01:58.780> very<00:01:58.960> thin<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.289> so<00:01:59.560> what<00:01:59.710> we

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
your hair gets very thin and so what we

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
up and when you do that with this

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.639 
up and when you do that with this
application<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.659> can<00:02:04.689> spend<00:02:05.049> for<00:02:05.200> sweaty<00:02:05.469> you

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
application you can spend for sweaty you
