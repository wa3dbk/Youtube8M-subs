yet because I have to get better with my
whole<00:02:50.190> editing<00:02:50.610> software<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:52.290> if<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.560> would

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
whole editing software but if you would

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.360 
whole editing software but if you would
like<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.190> see<00:02:53.400> how<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> achieved<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:55.370> phase

be able to show you the whole thing
because<00:03:04.739> I'll<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.100> take<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> links<00:03:05.670> along

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
because I'll just take the links along

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.630 
because I'll just take the links along
but<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.480> want<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.709> know<00:03:07.830> have<00:03:08.160> part<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.550> my

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
but I want to you know have part of my

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920 
but I want to you know have part of my
hair<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:08.880> want<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> take<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
hair I want to take it to the up to the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.430 
hair I want to take it to the up to the
primer<00:03:10.230> side<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.519> can<00:03:11.790> show<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.440> on

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
primer side you know I can show you on

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.400 
primer side you know I can show you on
my<00:03:13.650> shorter<00:03:14.040> parts<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.670> finger<00:03:15.660> coiling<00:03:16.200> them

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
my shorter parts I finger coiling them

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.310 
my shorter parts I finger coiling them
so<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:17.070> took<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.340> eco<00:03:17.970> styler<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.630> I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
so I just took that eco styler and I

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.540 
so I just took that eco styler and I
took<00:03:19.620> my<00:03:19.860> hair<00:03:20.070> like<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.730> i-12<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
took my hair like this and i-12 it and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.150 
took my hair like this and i-12 it and
so<00:03:23.550> it's<00:03:23.730> lower<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.290> actually<00:03:25.590> finger

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so it's lower back and I actually finger

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.080 
so it's lower back and I actually finger
coil<00:03:26.459> all<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:27.000> them<00:03:27.209> around<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.640> know<00:03:29.790> from

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
coil all of them around you know from

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.190 
coil all of them around you know from
the<00:03:30.209> sides<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> back<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.019> everything

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the sides and the back and everything

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.699 
the sides and the back and everything
like<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:31.980> within<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:33.319> think<00:03:34.319> my<00:03:34.410> third

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
like that but within I think my third

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.910 
like that but within I think my third
day<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:35.130> coils<00:03:35.610> has<00:03:35.790> hard<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.560> kind<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.680> come<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
day my coils has hard to kind of come a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
day my coils has hard to kind of come a
loose<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> little<00:03:38.550> bit<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.120> mud<00:03:39.360> at<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.569> top<00:03:39.900> in

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
loose a little bit the mud at the top in

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.259 
loose a little bit the mud at the top in
the<00:03:40.470> middle<00:03:40.769> they<00:03:40.950> were<00:03:41.010> fine<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.580> those<00:03:41.760> ties

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
the middle they were fine but those ties

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.289 
the middle they were fine but those ties
here<00:03:43.190> they<00:03:44.190> start<00:03:44.430> coming<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.730> looks<00:03:44.910> just<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
here they start coming to looks just a

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.890 
here they start coming to looks just a
little<00:03:45.329> bit<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:47.090> what<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.120> did<00:03:48.239> was<00:03:48.660> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
little bit and so what I did was I

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.530 
little bit and so what I did was I
started<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.709> took<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.489> coil<00:03:50.730> out<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.269> then

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
started to I took the coil out and then

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.470 
started to I took the coil out and then
I'm<00:03:51.720> too<00:03:51.930> sure<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.230> twisted<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:54.209> top

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
I'm too sure and twisted so the top

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.960 
I'm too sure and twisted so the top
parts<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.760> unravel

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
parts I unravel

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.420 
parts I unravel
most<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> coils<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.829> ran<00:03:58.980> twisted

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
most of the coils and I just ran twisted

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.490 
most of the coils and I just ran twisted
it<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.420> ones<00:04:00.630> here<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.019> side<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.290> I

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
it and the ones here on the side that I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.960 
it and the ones here on the side that I
could<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:01.860> my<00:04:01.980> two<00:04:02.040> tranches<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.579> those<00:04:02.790> as

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
could get my two tranches and those as

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.949 
could get my two tranches and those as
well<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:04.950> like<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.130> mixture<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.959> coils

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
well so it's like a mixture of coils

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.410 
well so it's like a mixture of coils
plus<00:04:07.620> two<00:04:07.980> strand<00:04:08.250> twists<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.880> took<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.329> out

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
plus two strand twists and I took it out

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.500 
plus two strand twists and I took it out
today<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.590> that's<00:04:11.280> again<00:04:11.820> that's<00:04:12.090> what<00:04:12.269> I<00:04:12.329> saw

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
today and that's again that's what I saw

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.530 
today and that's again that's what I saw
these<00:04:12.690> crazy<00:04:13.079> looking<00:04:13.440> at<00:04:13.530> flakes<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.980> my<00:04:14.100> hair

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
these crazy looking at flakes in my hair

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.779 
these crazy looking at flakes in my hair
but<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.530> still<00:04:16.829> like<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> definition

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
but you know I still like the definition

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.630 
but you know I still like the definition
I<00:04:17.850> still<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.239> how<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.510> came<00:04:18.720> out

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
I still like how it came out
