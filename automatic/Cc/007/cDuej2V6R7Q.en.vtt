00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.220
 let's see how a brush is made 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.320
 basic art in illustrator 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.010
 first we draw the shape that you have to 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.810
 have the brush since actually the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.360
 brush as such is a form that is 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.540
 adapt to a layout then let's 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.759
 make a used form a use that is like that 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.189
 finished in two points that we will what we 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.960
 is going to always top off in this 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.780
 case I recommend having the guides activated 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.740
 smart because it facilitates the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.460
 alignment 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.980
 you see to see marked a point I move and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.900
 as you see indicates 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.110
 the alignment and I click drag 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.020
 to do a little bit the use form I do 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.200
 Click here because I do not want to be notified 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.450
 that point and I already close at the same time 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.860
 drag 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.150
 trying to be more as symmetrical 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.680
 possible and there we would have the use 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.680
 we leave it in black 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.060
 we go here to color and we say the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.060
 black filling and without line 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.080
 and we already have the shape of the spindle what 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.110
 we can now crush a little bit with 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.960
 this tiradito frames this so that we do not 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.479
 come out very fat 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 and it's very easy to open the panel 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.590
 brushes and we throw it as you see it 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.880
 becomes one more and then we 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 ask what kind of brush 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 we choose art brush we say ok and we 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.750
 shows this what this box 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.150
 all right 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.980
 these are the ways he stretches it 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.240
 this is to prove it to see how it goes in 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.370
 this case where is going to go pretty 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.140
 well here we have the address that as 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.390
 it's symmetrical it does not matter if you go in one or 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.960
 in another what is not good is this nor 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.659
 is 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.090
 very well this is to flip it on its own 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.200
 you want to do it but like this symmetric 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.610
 has no problem this is the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.570
 way of colonization to then the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.660
 and here we see the name it 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.239
 art brush 1 and the width is at one hundred 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.180
 per cent what we have drawn or that is 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.640
 sensitive to pressure you have to tell him the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.760
 pressure fork you see that puts 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.040
 width of 100 and 100 as you move one this 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.700
 it's not because it 's the width here 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:34.269
 I lower it and it's up so something like that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.250
 from 29% to 580 voucher and ok and 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.590
 the brush has appeared to us there 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.190
 that we have used to create it the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.190
 we can erase 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.720
 and so 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.300
 we select the brush with the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.550
 Brush tool clear brushes 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.430
 art the only one that looks in real time 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.460
 it is always 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.610
 Calligraphic voucher 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.650
 selected all delete all 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.020
 art brushes show you 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.120
 um 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.310
 a previous form but come on you can 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.920
 get to work as we see this yes what 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.240
 we have is quite sensitive to 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.270
 pressure and it always ends in a point 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.230
 we can always give him here and there and 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.690
 adjust 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.940
 the only catch 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.760
 what you will see is that if we point it out 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.090
 we try to color him we go to 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.590
 color this is a line we have not yet 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.720
 expanded this is a line and we say 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.780
 that is red or not to orange what has 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.760
 come out there but we see that he does not take it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.860
 it's because of colonization we're going to go back to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.720
 panel we give twice to our 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.510
 brush and here it puts colonization method 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.390
 none if we choose nuances is the one 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.490
 you have to always say ok ok ya 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.130
 apply the strokes then come please 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.340
 What it does to me is that it has already 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.860
 can color as we want 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.690
 and nothing we have our brush done 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.700
 as a scientific curiosity if we want 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.000
 reverse engineer how they have 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.160
 made other brushes select all 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.660
 simply delete when 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.330
 drag you see what we just did 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.079
 we appear there as a brush 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.610
 although be careful because actually 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:25.100
 object of that grouping by the piece and 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.180
 a beige and a frame always puts a 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.010
 frame that frame we dismissed but with 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.530
 this could vary what this brush that 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.380
 there is here that I have touched this 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.639
 here we can also do it 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.379
 reverse engineering 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.780
 and nothing else this is a small 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.780
 introduction of the theme of the brushes
