00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.000
 (I just want to be with you tonight) 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 (I know that you want to be my babe) 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.500
 I hate things like promises are not necessary 

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:43.000
 I'm looking for a window that has been connected for a long time so it won't come morning 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.000
 Why did words come from history? 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.600
 Sun oxygen sea wind 

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.600
 It should have been enough (should) 

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:10.400
 I miss each other 

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:19.900
 No one gets hurt when it hurts properly 

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:24.600
 A string is broken and it becomes a life (life). 

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:34.100
 Please forgive me and hurry up in vain 

00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:44.500
 Let's go into more middle class (and up) and sway my impulse 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.700
 A moonlight that you don't care about everything 

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:17.750
 Feeling of inferiority 

00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:22.000
 Let's forget that 

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:26.700
 At the end it's all about myself 

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:36.500
 It is good to push through the truth of emptiness in the case of æ­¤

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:41.000
 I like the sharp eyes 

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:50.700
 I hate things like promises are not necessary 

00:02:50.701 --> 00:03:00.300
 I'm looking for a window that has been connected for a long time so it won't come morning 

00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:09.800
 Please forgive me and hurry up in vain 

00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:20.200
 Let's go into more middle class (and up) and sway my impulse
