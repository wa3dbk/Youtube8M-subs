00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone with you dmitry green and now 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 I 'll explain how and where to get dad 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.349
 equipment in draenor if you of course 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 play as a character horde faction 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.670
 let's start with the fact that pvp equipment is 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.029
 two kinds 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.939
 you on equipment purchased for honor points 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.529
 equipment purchased for conquest points 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.840
 pvp outfit bought hares 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.330
 conquest is better than equipment you 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 buy for honor points but in order to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.230
 consistently gain conquest points for us 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.469
 still have to assemble a complete set 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 equipment purchased for honor points 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.450
 There are two ways to get points in the game. 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.680
 the honor is both related to murder 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.809
 players of the opposite faction method 1 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 you can just walk the world 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.879
 look for players of the opposite faction and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 kill them 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.140
 second way he is more productive you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.360
 can walk on battlefields differently they 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.070
 are called bg from the english battle 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.770
 ground 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.729
 after the battle is over to you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.409
 a certain amount of honor points listed 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 the amount will depend on how you 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.270
 showed themselves on the battlefield 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 and whether you lost or 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.689
 won 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.119
 also at the end of bg you may 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.250
 drop a chest in which can get caught 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.880
 free pvp gear to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 but she may have different quality all 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.009
 depends on how you showed yourself on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.409
 the battlefield also in these chests can 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 drop out gold and extra points 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.930
 honor after several field hikes 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.970
 battlefield you accumulate a decent amount of points 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.210
 honor that you can change 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.520
 here your earlier now show you where 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.520
 you can actually change it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:58.930
 Here we go in this building 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.659
 and change honor points to npc equipment 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.439
 under the name dark hunter 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.600
 guarantor after you collect the whole 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.119
 pvp-kit purchased 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.980
 honor bunnies and you can try yourself 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.280
 in the arena for this you will need 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.500
 mate for winning the arena you will 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.540
 points are gained conquest that you 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.810
 You can spend on better pvp 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.880
 equipment and so to get to the arena 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.870
 open the pvp group search tab 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.410
 ranking battles arenas 2 by 2 and join 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.940
 We are going to fight with a partner 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.390
 on the arena amassed 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.519
 a certain amount of points of conquest come to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.870
 vendor whose name is lieutenant couple 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.130
 fight and buy clothes from him already for points 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.599
 conquests they differ they are better than those 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.730
 clothes you bought for honor points 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.110
 this npc is located 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.110
 here now show you on the map 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.690
 You can also go to the rating fields 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.459
 fight 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.709
 to the arena 3 for 3 5 for 5 but I personally 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.590
 I advise you to do it only after 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.880
 you will get a complete set 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.030
 pvp-equipment bought for points 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.950
 conquest and now briefly about the main thing 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.049
 First we go to bb farm honor points 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.590
 equip further we go to arena two 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.380
 on two we will be equipped and we can go already on 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.370
 all four sides even up to bb even though 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.359
 3 on 3 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.370
 at least for rbg rating battlegrounds on this 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.739
 everything 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.440
