my guns up with the Cobra trooper and I
just<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.049> flat<00:01:40.350> blue<00:01:40.650> stands

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
just really think this flat blue stands

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.039 
just really think this flat blue stands
out<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> bad<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.720> even<00:01:42.720> though<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
out in a bad way even though it is a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.980 
out in a bad way even though it is a
nicely<00:01:43.619> tweaked<00:01:43.860> sculpt<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.090> we'll<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:45.869> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
nicely tweaked sculpt so we'll put this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
nicely tweaked sculpt so we'll put this
off<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> side<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:46.740> I've<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> cabin

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.899 
one of the things about this figure
which<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> irked<00:01:59.399> me<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.880> I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
which kind of irked me because I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.510 
which kind of irked me because I
couldn't<00:02:00.180> tell<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.689> well<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.990> packaging<00:02:01.520> but

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
couldn't tell that well in packaging but

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.889 
couldn't tell that well in packaging but
he<00:02:02.670> has<00:02:02.820> no<00:02:02.969> hair<00:02:03.860> he<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:04.950> completely<00:02:05.310> bald

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
happened between point A and B where

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.460 
happened between point A and B where
they<00:02:18.819> thought<00:02:19.030> they'd<00:02:19.150> make<00:02:19.299> him<00:02:19.450> bald<00:02:19.659> so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
they thought they'd make him bald so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.229 
they thought they'd make him bald so
even<00:02:20.920> though<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.010> honestly<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.970> look<00:02:22.150> of

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
even though I honestly like the look of

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.759 
even though I honestly like the look of
him<00:02:22.299> wearing<00:02:22.599> his<00:02:22.810> little<00:02:23.049> yellow<00:02:23.290> goggles

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
more I'll probably end up keeping the

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.199 
more I'll probably end up keeping the
helmet<00:02:26.769> on<00:02:26.860> him<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:29.140> oh<00:02:29.379> well<00:02:29.859> no<00:02:30.640> great<00:02:31.000> loss

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
helmet on him but oh well no great loss

got him yet but he has this tendril arm
and<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.340> honestly<00:04:45.580> assumed<00:04:46.030> they<00:04:46.210> would<00:04:46.330> give

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
and I honestly assumed they would give

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.020 
and I honestly assumed they would give
it<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.840> rip<00:04:47.020> cord<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.530> he<00:04:47.710> could<00:04:47.890> um<00:04:48.010> like<00:04:49.000> a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
it to rip cord so he could um like a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.790 
it to rip cord so he could um like a
bio-viper<00:04:49.480> arm<00:04:49.960> attachment<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.530> definitely

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
bio-viper arm attachment that definitely

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.680 
bio-viper arm attachment that definitely
would<00:04:50.920> have<00:04:50.950> made<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.250> guy<00:04:51.430> stand<00:04:51.760> out<00:04:51.940> they

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
would have made this guy stand out they

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.880 
would have made this guy stand out they
would<00:04:52.810> have<00:04:52.900> definitely<00:04:53.050> cemented<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.740> he

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
would have definitely cemented that he

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.230 
would have definitely cemented that he
