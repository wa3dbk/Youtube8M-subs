00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.970
 lots of fun and good guys 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.680
 we started with the photos in the first 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.840
 photo that we see is what this is 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.390
 that many memories brings us and that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.990
 so many epic battles we have seen here 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.000
 no, we have the sand here 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.310
 Martial arts tournament 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.280
 we are on the tatami and well then 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.220
 say no there you see it tatami with a peak 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.050
 the unam and then there is on the tatami no 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.490
 there is not much to say is to say I can not 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.860
 analyze thoroughly because you can do us 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.000
 good and the little leaves in the background are 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.130
 dark green along with the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.960
 blue background seats 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.580
 you know I will not say that then then 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.770
 good guys there is to have the first photo 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.870
 in the second photo we see that we are in 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.250
 the area where you bought it is worth there you see 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.470
 the two 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.690
 or low and good as you are seeing then 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.910
 play tuna with this one in me with scene 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.480
 medium and good because it seems that this 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.860
 So we are going through the zone of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.690
 the martial arts go all 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.940
 during that during in everything that is the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.700
 martial arts precinct and we eat 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.800
 in the third photo , the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.570
 presenter there in the background and here we are 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 with doom and the truth that I do not remember 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.010
 I do not know if it is in this same scenario 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.360
 where we play the first time 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.820
 where we have to look for something rocket 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.560
 wax is I think it's here but it's like 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.600
 changed not I'm not sure since 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.310
 I do not remember the regime anymore if 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.870
 wrong and good guys because they 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.150
 comment not of this because they are already 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.610
 teaching several things here we have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.800
 the martial arts the last episode 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.290
 survey showed us the machine is 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 say they are teaching that content that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.570
 We were more concerned, let's say, not because we 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.850
 worried and I the first included myself in 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.540
 if you are going to be able to bring these things is 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.340
 tell 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.650
 this poll machine already you see that I do know 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.750
 if they are and the tournament then there is 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.730
 not for the moment so at the moment you're 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.590
 doubts we are not clearing them anymore and good 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.900
 here in the first photo we have the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.299
 little yuppie against camps that loser and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.069
 Sarcastic plan puts some decades 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.110
 Once it was there you got some prize 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.780
 for how long has this been supported 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.849
 project so good if this is 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.220
 question I started to support this 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.109
 project I do not remember when I started 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.209
 to do the videos about six 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.889
 months so I found out about the project like this 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.949
 good I since that time I've been 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.310
 to project the project to butt good we 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.930
 they say here finally that they are very healthy 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.280
 who are aware that the names 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.080
 of the monsters are not translated 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.610
 we just have not worried about 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.470
 it's still one of the least things 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.960
 important at this time like 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.729
 always mark on these in these 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.680
 episodes of goods with worse and 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.050
 we know that enough of the things still 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.120
 they are not translated since they are not 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.910
 the most important things and I'm sure 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.470
 that the beta some things obviously 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.160
 yes they will be translated but things 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.380
 how are you in plan n fish and things like that 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.570
 they will not be translated since neither 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.820
 is necessary for a beta then I 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.780
 I think the necessary thing is that you can 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.550
 play being able to make dungeons and 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.680
 quest machine and things like that for the diet 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.620
 and then when it opens then take out the 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.990
 juice well translated and perfect then 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.000
 guys well up here would be this third 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.580
 Friday with db now as I say 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.100
 I always try to make the videos the most 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.710
 long possible to be able to entertain you 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.080
 but it is not possible for me since you already see 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.880
 the little content that they give us in these 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.639
 Small Friday with duty is not much 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.230
 It's not a lot of content but, well, something is 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.389
 something I do not leave the images in the video 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.100
 so you can see them and good as 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.870
 I always tell you, you can go through the 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.340
 web through the official website of 'dragon ball' 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.050
 online revelations to see you the 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.120
