00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
normally we twist the whole thing and

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.390 
normally we twist the whole thing and
then<00:02:21.690> take<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.020> big<00:02:22.319> chunks<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.920> hair<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
braids together and it never really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500

comes<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> wavy<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> decided<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.270> try

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
comes out that wavy so I decided to try

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.680 
comes out that wavy so I decided to try
her<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.640> results<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.330> in

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
her way and this is the results in in

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:46.880 
her way and this is the results in in
the<00:02:30.870> braids<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.940> looks<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.780> know

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890

it's very quickly so new being wrinkled

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.930 
it's very quickly so new being wrinkled
is<00:03:55.049> less<00:03:55.200> equal<00:03:55.379> but<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.489> braid<00:03:56.730> out

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
is less equal but it's just a braid out

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
it as well I like it

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.080 
it as well I like it
my<00:04:21.810> hair<00:04:22.019> feels<00:04:22.229> really<00:04:22.500> light<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:23.090> think

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
my hair feels really light I think

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.250 
my hair feels really light I think
that's<00:04:24.270> from<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.600> apple<00:04:24.930> cider<00:04:25.080> vinegar

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
that's from the apple cider vinegar

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.439 
that's from the apple cider vinegar
rinse<00:04:25.889> though<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.220> think<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.820> just<00:04:27.060> feels<00:04:27.330> so

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
rinse though I think it just feels so

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.409 
rinse though I think it just feels so
much<00:04:27.660> lighter<00:04:28.139> than<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.590> did<00:04:28.740> before<00:04:29.180> me<00:04:30.180> now

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
much lighter than it did before me now

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.390 
much lighter than it did before me now
that<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:30.720> did<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.199> apple<00:04:31.470> cider<00:04:31.620> vinegar<00:04:31.800> rinse

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
that I did the apple cider vinegar rinse

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.420 
that I did the apple cider vinegar rinse
and<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:33.750> feel<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.470> mine<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> little<00:04:34.770> darker<00:04:35.250> to

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and I feel like mine a little darker to

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.270 
and I feel like mine a little darker to

very<00:04:51.800> flat<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:53.340> flat<00:04:53.639> but<00:04:53.669> you<00:04:54.120> need<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.360> see<00:04:54.510> a

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
very flat not flat but you need to see a

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.290 
very flat not flat but you need to see a
lot<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.990> parts<00:04:55.620> but<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.700> guess<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.090> day<00:04:57.270> or

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
lot of the parts but I guess in a day or

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.870 
lot of the parts but I guess in a day or
two<00:04:57.510> that'll<00:04:57.810> go<00:04:57.960> away<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:58.710> other<00:04:59.669> than<00:04:59.820> that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880

I'm really happy with it so I guess it's

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.430
