forward<00:01:44.340> ablaze<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.540> thing

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
forward ablaze in there and the thing

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
forward ablaze in there and the thing
just<00:01:45.750> clicks<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.380> place<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.090> kind<00:01:48.329> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
just clicks in place like so so kind of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
just clicks in place like so so kind of
a<00:01:48.450> different<00:01:48.600> style<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.890> sits<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.280> real

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a different style kind of sits down real

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.030 
a different style kind of sits down real
nice<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.020> antenna<00:01:52.020> lists<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
nice to antenna lists this is kind of a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
nice to antenna lists this is kind of a
new<00:01:53.159> trend<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.579> too<00:01:53.640> obviously<00:01:54.570> there's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
new trend now too obviously there's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.649 
new trend now too obviously there's
antenna<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.680> built<00:01:55.860> into<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
antenna but it's just built into the

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
antenna but it's just built into the
internals<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> radio<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.320> saw<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
internals of the radio I saw you have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
internals of the radio I saw you have
nothing<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> break<00:01:59.670> off<00:01:59.850> nothing<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.299> worry

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
nothing to break off nothing to worry

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.429 
nothing to break off nothing to worry
about<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> buggy<00:02:02.610> itself<00:02:03.409> take<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
about there to the buggy itself take a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.959 
about there to the buggy itself take a
look<00:02:04.590> at<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.979> mean<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> pretty<00:02:05.430> like

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
look at this I mean this is pretty like

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.910 
look at this I mean this is pretty like
I<00:02:06.000> said<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.390> pretty<00:02:06.600> unique<00:02:06.719> Baja<00:02:07.590> style

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
I said it's pretty unique Baja style

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160 
I said it's pretty unique Baja style
buggy<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.670> got<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> scale<00:02:09.149> lights<00:02:09.390> scale

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

really<00:02:12.629> hugs<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> chassis<00:02:13.560> real

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
really hugs the chassis real

really hugs the chassis real
the<00:02:14.319> chassis<00:02:14.739> something<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.069> take<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.250> look<00:02:15.400> at

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the chassis something to take a look at

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.180 
the chassis something to take a look at
two<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.659> twin<00:02:16.959> vertical<00:02:17.500> plate<00:02:17.739> aluminum

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.729 
two it's a twin vertical plate aluminum
chassis<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.120> instead<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.599> plastic<00:02:20.049> tub<00:02:20.260> we

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
chassis so instead of a plastic tub we

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.170 
chassis so instead of a plastic tub we
have<00:02:20.860> two<00:02:21.040> aluminum<00:02:21.580> plates<00:02:21.760> running<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
have two aluminum plates running the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.869 
have two aluminum plates running the
length<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.780> whole<00:02:23.170> buggy<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.879> everything

length of the whole buggy and everything

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.339 
length of the whole buggy and everything
kind<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.090> bolts<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.540> them<00:02:25.629> they<00:02:25.930> make<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.230> real

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
kind of bolts to them they make it real

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.660 
kind of bolts to them they make it real
rigid<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:26.980> see<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.250> thing's<00:02:27.459> real

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
rigid you can see this thing's real

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.729 
rigid you can see this thing's real
narrow<00:02:27.879> to<00:02:28.150> mimic<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.420> Baja<00:02:28.870> style<00:02:29.230> well

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
narrow to mimic that Baja style well

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.080 
narrow to mimic that Baja style well
those<00:02:29.920> plates<00:02:30.190> make<00:02:30.400> sure<00:02:30.579> there's<00:02:30.879> not<00:02:31.060> a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
those plates make sure there's not a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
those plates make sure there's not a
little<00:02:31.329> hot<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> whole<00:02:31.870> lot<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.110> torquing<00:02:32.530> or

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
little hot a whole lot of torquing or

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.410 
little hot a whole lot of torquing or
bending<00:02:32.950> that's<00:02:33.099> allowed<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.269> kind

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
bending that's allowed so it just kind

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.240 
bending that's allowed so it just kind
of<00:02:34.480> adds<00:02:34.569> some<00:02:34.870> strength<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.319> rigidity<00:02:35.409> you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
of adds some strength and rigidity you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.520 
of adds some strength and rigidity you
have<00:02:36.450> things<00:02:37.450> I'm<00:02:37.629> noticing<00:02:37.870> right<00:02:38.019> away<00:02:38.349> an

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
have things I'm noticing right away an

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.140 
have things I'm noticing right away an
aluminum<00:02:38.950> top<00:02:39.159> plate<00:02:39.430> for<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.730> rear<00:02:39.879> shock

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
aluminum top plate for the rear shock

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.990 
aluminum top plate for the rear shock
tower<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.930> add<00:02:41.079> strength<00:02:41.610> instead<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.790> just

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
tower to add strength instead of just

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.030 
tower to add strength instead of just
upper<00:02:43.510> turnbuckles<00:02:44.110> here<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.590> upper<00:02:44.890> IA

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
upper turnbuckles here we have upper IA

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800 
upper turnbuckles here we have upper IA
arms<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.879> guess<00:02:46.060> you'd<00:02:46.239> call<00:02:46.269> these<00:02:46.599> if<00:02:46.780> you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
arms I guess you'd call these if you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.589 
arms I guess you'd call these if you
like<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.290> these<00:02:47.829> guys<00:02:48.069> right<00:02:48.310> here<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.180> just<00:02:49.299> a

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
like to these guys right here so just a

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.089 
like to these guys right here so just a
tie<00:02:49.780> rod<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.170> got<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> whole<00:02:50.530> strength<00:02:50.829> peace

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
tie rod you got a whole strength peace

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.680 
tie rod you got a whole strength peace
that<00:02:51.340> again<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.819> just<00:02:51.849> adds<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.299> durability

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
that again it just adds the durability

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.380 
that again it just adds the durability
one<00:02:53.379> more<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:54.040> more<00:02:54.069> thing<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.640> increase<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
one more one more thing to increase the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.330 
one more one more thing to increase the
strength<00:02:55.629> of<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.379> have<00:02:56.470> steel<00:02:56.769> adjustable

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
strength of it you have steel adjustable

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.069 
strength of it you have steel adjustable
turnbuckles<00:02:57.819> front<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.209> rear<00:02:58.359> so<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.930> can

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
turnbuckles front and rear so you can

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.649 
turnbuckles front and rear so you can
fine-tune<00:02:59.319> all<00:02:59.769> your<00:03:00.329> alignment<00:03:01.329> settings

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
fine-tune all your alignment settings

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.509 
fine-tune all your alignment settings
and<00:03:01.810> suspension<00:03:02.349> these<00:03:02.829> are<00:03:03.010> oil<00:03:03.190> filled

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
and suspension these are oil filled

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.670 
and suspension these are oil filled
shocks<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.599> can<00:03:04.720> adjust<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.109> spring<00:03:05.409> preload

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
shocks you can adjust the spring preload

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.039 
shocks you can adjust the spring preload
on<00:03:05.950> them<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.220> course<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.150> really<00:03:07.810> good

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
on them of course so really good

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.720 
on them of course so really good
dampening<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.190> see<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.370> most<00:03:09.549> of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
dampening just like we see on most of

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.170 
dampening just like we see on most of
our<00:03:09.849> CS<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:11.079> driveline<00:03:11.670> good<00:03:12.670> old<00:03:12.819> ARMA

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
our CS and a driveline good old ARMA

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.220 
our CS and a driveline good old ARMA
they're<00:03:13.329> following<00:03:13.599> suit<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:13.989> all<00:03:14.109> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
they're following suit with all the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.569 
they're following suit with all the
other<00:03:14.319> companies<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.040> an<00:03:15.159> all<00:03:15.310> steel

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
other companies this is an all steel

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.640 
other companies this is an all steel
driveline<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.359> we<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:16.599> all<00:03:16.780> steel<00:03:17.079> internals

a sealed fluid differential you don't
usually<00:03:20.260> get<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.919> companies<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.459> you

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
usually get that with companies so you

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.159 
usually get that with companies so you

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
can change the differential fluid and

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.930 
can change the differential fluid and
change<00:03:23.650> how<00:03:23.799> much<00:03:23.980> traction<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.579> have<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.849> the

did note on the water on the box it's

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.250 
did note on the water on the box it's
called<00:03:48.340> water<00:03:48.579> resistant<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.209> dustproof<00:03:49.629> so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
called water resistant and dustproof so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.479 
called water resistant and dustproof so
they're<00:03:50.440> not<00:03:50.530> necessarily<00:03:50.739> saying

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489

the battery hatch is on the bottom so

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.900 
the battery hatch is on the bottom so
because<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:28.980> style<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:29.880> know

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
because of the style of this you know

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.580 
because of the style of this you know
they<00:04:30.120> got<00:04:30.240> all<00:04:30.450> this<00:04:30.570> flux<00:04:30.840> on<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.290> scale
