00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.330
 Welcome to the discovery tube 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.519
 today we deal with the 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.220
 statute is a small program which 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.740
 to the data or folder to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.199
 sync both over network as well 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.480
 also locally on the pc for linux users 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 It is very comfortable and easy 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 like ubuntu is easy 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.590
 already preinstalled for the windows 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.300
 the work is a bit more complicated 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.920
 you have to download first and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.210
 then the handling is something 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.980
 other then you have an exe file and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860
 plus a bachelor in the bed 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 you have to fall everything quasi 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 So enter as on the command line 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.859
 from linux so if you like the under 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 linux can or will track this video 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.890
 and look at the command then 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.390
 could be the same in the batch 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 use it so we start like 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.990
 It is said ten years ago 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.470
 enter frank then you see here already 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.600
 all the parameters you have and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.400
 can it's a really powerful 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.979
 tool you can do a lot with it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.970
 Here you can also see josef and here 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 to use it 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.860
 The option, of course, then ran the front 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.090
 sauce before and then that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.850
 request a destination 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.060
 I 've prepared something I've got 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 my son and my destination here 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.720
 if I make something like that now 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.159
 I once made two pictures purely 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.630
 and in text file or destination 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.990
 claim is empty 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.990
 so then match Baumann 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.800
 What do I want to do? I want it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.869
 archive that means that the files 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.600
 their, for example, their entire attributes 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.430
 These have also been passed over there 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.620
 I want to do that record low 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.990
 If still a subfolder in so 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.710
 Of course he will join in what is in it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.790
 and only tries that one 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.520
 get small 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.320
 which will be at the file size has 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.790
 sometimes looked around 14 kilometers 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.970
 do not mind but if you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.460
 can transfer larger amounts of data 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:55.160
 make her so useful for so afterwards 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:57.080
 So the folder is where then 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.300
 should go all this way so 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.300
 Blank and then it starts again 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.550
 and if it had already suppressed 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.330
 the whole already done and if 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.110
 Now you have a destination 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.280
 daily 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.290
 put that in our file what the coal 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.110
 at first if I for example 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.510
 Change this text file 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:38.450
 Let's take a look at the secret projects 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:42.800
 from discovery channel and I end now 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.270
 just get the content of the file 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.850
 Of course not until the winter 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:53.180
 now once again running this and changes the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:01.010
 whole also in the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:04.129
 request that these parts exist 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.719
 it was not before, and that means first 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.560
 then look in the files so it 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:11.150
 really nothing is lost so now 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.609
 put under prejudices we here the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.840
 the folder that is almost ours 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:22.430
 backup and I just now 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:27.110
 here this image and I leave now 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.139
 what we criticize him we notice in 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.120
 destination it is still in there too 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.490
 I do not really want me at all 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.750
 will the folder are always the same as 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.979
 Come on now , even if I have something 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.970
 deleted and should have it here too 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:44.660
 not be in it 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:53.650
 good for it is how you get up here 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.650
 can see the song command run 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:13.849
 and now it should be in here right now 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:19.280
 that we now first the the 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:21.080
 introduction should like on the head 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.570
 to give his a brief overview 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:29.449
 about the program and here it looks 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.259
 There are many more things that will be 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:36.199
 But to us that to burst the frame 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:39.460
 Just try it yourself and then 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.460
 I would say until the
