00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello, nice to see you again 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.140
 finally among us then the noise runs 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.220
 on the internet that you would have joined 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.059
 secret the campaign team of françois 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.320
 Holland 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.210
 then info or intox 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.100
 actually it was me who found the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.140
 rallying sign 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 I found the concept at 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.840
 theater of the golden hand I work there 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.840
 already for a few years it's a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.180
 information I was approached by 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.619
 friends they told me here we need 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.399
 from you we live a historic moment 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.899
 a good change 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.430
 so before you explain to us more 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.100
 in detail sense of that moment I you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 propose internet friends to watch in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.340
 images the launch of this sign of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 rally 1 at the first big 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 meeting of françois hollande au bourget 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.969
 immediately the images change 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.969
 it's now it's now 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.190
 so god given that means this gesture 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.760
 what is the meaning it is when 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.740
 same particular is this is the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.009
 double quenelle you have it street then 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.270
 done with more or less success by 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.400
 report to some who have not followed 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.680
 my recommendations but it's double 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.300
 cinnamon you know my language 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 he has a little raw sometimes in the big 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.550
 family attentions 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.619
 are you going to let the kids a bath 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.789
 I fell one in the mouth I put you 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.830
 the other in a shock with holland that 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.869
 in the mouth as if we do that if that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.580
 walk so little they have not kept them 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.670
 text but no no what they found 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.860
 their now we see with Jacques 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.940
 lambert it's interesting that the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.899
 movement is more is more voluntary 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.030
 should we can see if they wanted 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.649
 actually look of course these 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.950
 images jack lang is in force 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.450
 that's pretty well elected so we've got some 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.580
 much worked his game finds him 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.830
 very a bit excessive 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.539
 now and that's jacques lang darmon 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.860
 for example I was able to see again 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.530
 his movement if you want 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.430
 let's look at I have a great actor put 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.760
 okay friends let's look at the gesture this 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.760
 change 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.920
 no no he is 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.989
 see these cards was that for 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.569
 to have friends we recognize some 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:31.290
 dsk dough especially in what you have 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.880
 just now we had talked about the case 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.379
 So when François Holland put me in 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.510
 guard told me dieudo attention I do not 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.370
 do not want there to be a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.050
 approach too obvious with the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.390
 dsk case that hangs unfortunately 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.129
 around unhappy in these elections that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.739
 yet that's great obviously 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.220
 obviously beyond efficiency digest 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.690
 there is a real symbolism I you I 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.900
 make you shut your mouth and I'll take it 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.040
 crowd in your ass you see it's in 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
 your ass in your mouth 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.780
 Me I put you in your face I will 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.140
 lightning we are in front 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.810
 thank you for having followed this 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.180
 this show with sick phenom 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.510
 sick and conclude with the gesture 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:22.380
 1 now change the field of 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:22.380
 thought now change
