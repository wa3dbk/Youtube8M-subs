00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
going to be giving away when I whip

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.080 
going to be giving away when I whip
through<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.930> real<00:00:22.109> fast<00:00:22.640> sorry<00:00:23.640> by<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.789> frame

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
through it real fast sorry by the frame

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.609 
through it real fast sorry by the frame
rate<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:24.930> laptop<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
rate and doing this on my laptop for a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.390 
rate and doing this on my laptop for a
change<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> 11<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:28.920> 11<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.369> 11

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
change so this is the 11 by 11 by 11

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240 
change so this is the 11 by 11 by 11
reactor<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.230> 80,000<00:00:32.070> power

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
reactor think it's about 80,000 power

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
reactor think it's about 80,000 power
you<00:00:32.820> need<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> start<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.600> any<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.860> that's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you need to start off any so that's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
you need to start off any so that's
pretty<00:00:35.399> straightforward<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.510> next<00:00:37.200> we've

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
pretty straightforward and next we've

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
pretty straightforward and next we've
got<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> ballistics<00:00:37.829> gel<00:00:38.160> from<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.210> proving

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
got the ballistics gel from the proving

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.010 
got the ballistics gel from the proving
grounds<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> test<00:00:41.700> your

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
grounds so you can use that to test your

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.310 
grounds so you can use that to test your
test<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.170> ships<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.899> try<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> move<00:00:46.140> from

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
test your ships out and try to move from

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.410 
test your ships out and try to move from
thrusters<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.520> next<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
thrusters right next we have the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.470 
thrusters right next we have the
landspeeder<00:00:49.379> which<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.920> made<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.370> son<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
landspeeder which I made with my son the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.279 
landspeeder which I made with my son the
smell<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> tutorial<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.030> cool

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
smell it tutorial so that's pretty cool

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
smell it tutorial so that's pretty cool
this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> stage<00:00:56.129> 3<00:00:56.610> reactor<00:00:57.149> sort<00:00:57.629> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
this is a stage 3 reactor sort of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.680 
this is a stage 3 reactor sort of
without<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> hull<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.250> see

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
without the hull on it so you can see

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
without the hull on it so you can see
that's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.780> prototype<00:01:01.289> north<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> stage<00:01:02.879> 3

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's a prototype north at the stage 3

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.050 
that's a prototype north at the stage 3
reactor<00:01:03.660> goes<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.229> ship<00:01:04.640> all<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:05.880> one

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
reactor goes on this ship all about one

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
reactor goes on this ship all about one
that's<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> stage<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.900> holes<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.159> just

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that's the stage for holes and you just

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.789 
that's the stage for holes and you just
fit<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> document<00:01:09.479> answer<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.590> put

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
fit it in the document answer and put

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
fit it in the document answer and put
your<00:01:10.920> turrets<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> turret

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
your turrets on and that's the turret

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.890 
your turrets on and that's the turret
whole<00:01:13.229> ship<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.850> shouldn't<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.630> here

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
whole ship that one shouldn't be here

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.830 
whole ship that one shouldn't be here
it's<00:01:16.350> too<00:01:16.830> heavy<00:01:17.360> that's<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> twelve

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's too heavy that's the twelve

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.070 
it's too heavy that's the twelve
thousand<00:01:19.290> kilometres<00:01:19.470> per<00:01:19.770> hour<00:01:20.009> engine<00:01:21.080> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
thousand kilometres per hour engine so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
thousand kilometres per hour engine so
that<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.310> next<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that will be there as well next is the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.780 
that will be there as well next is the
plane<00:01:24.840> built<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.470> built<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.100> tootin<00:01:26.430> wesi

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
plane built by built for tootin wesi

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
plane built by built for tootin wesi
I'll<00:01:27.360> try<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.810> find<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> complete<00:01:28.409> version

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
I'll try and find the complete version

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
I'll try and find the complete version
of<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.040> blueprint<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.670> spadina<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of this blueprint I spadina as a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.929 
of this blueprint I spadina as a
placeholder<00:01:30.740> here<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.310> turret<00:01:32.700> ship

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
placeholder here we have the turret ship

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.460 
placeholder here we have the turret ship
with<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> engine<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.409> fitted<00:01:34.850> hmm<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
with the engine actually fitted hmm so

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.649 
with the engine actually fitted hmm so
there's<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.509> we've

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
there's that and then next to it we've

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
there's that and then next to it we've
got<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> stealth<00:01:40.049> bomber<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.979> projectiles

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
got a stealth bomber with projectiles

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.530 
got a stealth bomber with projectiles
just<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.490> then<00:01:44.490> next<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.210> solar

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
just there and then next to it got solar

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.340 
just there and then next to it got solar
