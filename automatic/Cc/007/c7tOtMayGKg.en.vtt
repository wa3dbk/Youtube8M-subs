00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 and that pollution is to share 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 this earth plus family you have made them 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.950
 with this train we are going to be able to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.320
 protect protect our applications 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 so that no payments have been made without 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.410
 our finger so next in that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.970
 arias wants us to be what will 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 grabbing the spray bon well it is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 saying is going to need our footprint like that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 that I will have to maybe not give us the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 finger is then very good this year 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
 has interior of the homes and well 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.310
 that we installed us with a restart 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 fast there are other tweets that are the same 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 to this one but really none like this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 because for security by the way 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.980
 the design for everything and why I say it 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 Well, for example, I'm going to sell 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 live whatsapp and can see how from 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 the icon I get a granny that I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.510
 I have to put in then I put my 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 fingerprint and you can see how it opens up to me is a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 very father design then the truth that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.710
 yes it looks very very very very nice then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.199
 that there will be an entrepreneur also when 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
 there comes a notification and for example in 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.070
 guasa that is the one that I have description 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 nothing I get the banner but I get it and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.049
 with the whatsapp and I get out there is also 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.370
 the eye of the footprint that can not be 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.200
 see what they write to me if I 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.270
 I do not put my fingerprint then the truth 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.140
 I really liked this, let's see 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.370
 now the adjustments that this tea gives us 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.040
 and here it is we are going to look for more fogueados 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.930
 and how they see when I was when we entered 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.119
 we are told to put the code 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.240
 I already put it in here then it has an 8 that 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.070
 be safe and 3 here shop my selection 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.259
 for us to activate it only when 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.600
 we want it to be used in this case 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.729
 We need activator I do not want it 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.250
 use this option because I think you spend 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.580
 a little the battery then here we have 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.860
 advanced security like we want that 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.840
 ask us the mark on the options in the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.330
 spotlight control center multitasking 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.950
 to turn it off and to move the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.840
 applications and for together is like 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.729
 when I have to pay and for photos 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 so that nobody can pay it level 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.869
 we here we select the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.030
 apps that we want to call more I have the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.250
 whatsapp and facebook messenger well 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.259
 that are the only ones that I want to have 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.970
 we could also put security 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.520
 our folders that we have as 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.310
 can see I do not have any then 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.720
 now yes with sure of the centuries 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.790
 adjustments we can also put them 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.739
 security and also to the Friesians who 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.880
 would be the ones that we have the center of 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.600
 control very well 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.610
 we also have here options 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.650
 of the password we can 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.630
 change it here we have but it 's 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.870
 really in your king and that vibrates and when 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.910
 it is incorrect that requires authorization 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.610
 here we have some advanced options that 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.370
 we put dark geo that does not show 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.790
 notifications and app content all 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.890
 these options as you can see wifi the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.590
 stability so that it does not get 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.840
 rest slide the application and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.340
 surely then here we have some 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.770
 very good options as you can see 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.080
 then this click these settings that we 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.790
 provides and costs truth has very father 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.410
 when we put in our 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.970
 footprint when asked for example by whom 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.760
 I follow my own with my series here 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.980
 I put it and quickly and it opens me 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.290
 the application uses true very father 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.790
 apart that gives us a lot of security in 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.290
 all aspects and that's why the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.360
 colleagues this study click I hope that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.070
