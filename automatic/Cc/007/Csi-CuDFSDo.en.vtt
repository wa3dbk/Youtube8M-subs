00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
as this you'll see a ripple effect on

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.580 
as this you'll see a ripple effect on
the<00:02:51.490> signals<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.210> there's<00:02:53.020> your<00:02:53.170> overhead

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
the signals and there's your overhead

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.590 
the signals and there's your overhead
