00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
we work as hard as we can the next two

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
we work as hard as we can the next two
months<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.309> try<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> keep<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.600> get

months and try and keep up there and get
our<00:00:33.870> bodies<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.829> ourselves<00:00:35.130> running<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
our bodies and ourselves running to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.549 
our bodies and ourselves running to
learn<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.180> trials<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:37.170> difference

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
learn more trials so much difference

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.049

with<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> short<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.489> mean<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
with the short I think I mean it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.670 
with the short I think I mean it
definitely<00:00:42.210> gives<00:00:42.540> us<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> experience<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
definitely gives us the experience of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.830 
definitely gives us the experience of
racing<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> foreigners<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> having<00:00:45.600> such<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
racing the foreigners and having such a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
racing the foreigners and having such a
great<00:00:45.989> competition<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.770> European<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
great competition with European but it's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
great competition with European but it's
definitely<00:00:48.420> harder<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.289> me<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> Ashley

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
definitely harder for me and Ashley

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
definitely harder for me and Ashley
because<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.309> underwaters<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.629> supposed<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
because my underwaters not supposed to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
because my underwaters not supposed to
manage<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.800> me<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> other

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
manage for me I know some of the other

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
manage for me I know some of the other
team<00:00:54.329> members<00:00:54.360> kind<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> start<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> same

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
team members kind of start with the same

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170 
team members kind of start with the same
thing<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.250> almost<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.640> lot<00:00:56.850> better<00:00:56.969> when

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
thing and it's almost a lot better when

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.029 
thing and it's almost a lot better when
we<00:00:57.270> skip<00:00:57.480> over<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
we skip over water and we just go for it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
we skip over water and we just go for it
um<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.449> definitely<00:01:00.539> gave<00:01:00.870> us<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
um so I think it definitely gave us a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.330 
um so I think it definitely gave us a
good<00:01:01.230> look<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.649> summer<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.219> we
