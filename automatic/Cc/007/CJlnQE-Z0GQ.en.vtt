 and it has a clean plus function 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.000
 then inside 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.210
 this was a clear friend 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.400

 a fine was there then at 60 degrees then 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.130
 have the synthetic 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.260

 for example a lingerie 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.180

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.130
 hand wash program 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.479
 it is of course cold and low 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.310
 touring 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.229
 has the special program for them 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.750
 everything to do with the drum movement 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.180
 also with the wear 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.030
 of course from the teams that that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.410
 you have few revs also has this one 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.660
 washing machine and special colors 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.160
 programs become darker colors 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.500
 and the light colors 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.500
 of course in a combination with your colors 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.720
 and detergent also he has a special 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.330
 program for the white 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 articulation that is a combination with the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.700
 oxygen the bleaching agent 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.899
 make your tricias with your loose waist yes 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.390
 good optimal 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.119
 white clean this washing machine has two 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.850
 only programs it was eco program 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.050
 on cotton is for the heavily soiled laundry 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.360
 and become 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 is polluted was also a single 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.959
 program 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.030
 aqua eco and then it 's twister super 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.060
 economical then he also has one 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.640
 the program was quickly completed in 15 minutes 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.620
 and that's up to 3 pounds 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.860
 then have two separate programs 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.270
 one rinse and center and one is 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.160
 completely unrelated 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.680
 then we have two more 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.440
 Buttons one is for the eco and those that do 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.849
 in this case also colors of 60 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.349
 degrees goes to 15 degrees if 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.360
 Logically the colors therefore remain something 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.310
 better and you also see the eco monitor 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.110
 to become a lot more efficient at once 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.150
 crazy but because first there were four 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.790
 with this a colorful program 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.959
 and if you put it in there are only two we 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 also have another option then 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.370
 namely extra the fast program 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.640
 well not really eco of course but then 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.470
 he will heat super fast 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.380
 it is ready a bit faster instead 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.490
 from 2 hours and 20 minutes in an hour and 35 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.840
 minutes 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.700
 just call it turbo 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.510
 program can also wash programs 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.190
 the self 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.270
 june and for example the temperature 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.770
 60 degrees your 5:22 your degrees 213 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.360
 of course what is faster is the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.810
 logical because has a tomato and that on 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.280
 to warm up 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.830
 and you see the 40 degree see 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.810
 even faster 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.150
 30 degrees even faster and 15 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.420
 degrees three and two hours left 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.239
 and all that is with the 85 degrees then 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.739
 he also has it as a function 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.840
 dosing advice how much washing mail you need 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.239
 to use , we must close the door 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.430
 and hold for 3 seconds 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.170
 and then do not specify exactly how much 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.900
 detergent you should use in this case 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.720
 80 milliliters and pieces 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.850
 super handy because in this way you take 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.260
 with your exactly how much detergent you have 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.030
 must use what have you had many 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.709
 naturally you have to be good at it 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.330
 use some more and cut back 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.350
 of course also more so again one 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.019
 type 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.000
 eco you can also do this wash program yourself 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.200
 determine when that is done 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.350
 namely an end time 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.790
 selection on it up to 24 hours after this too 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.959
 lots to do 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.019
 yes , of course, he always has to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.540
 can wash 21 hours yes and then you know 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.850
 level that he is then you can also 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.010
 one more option one more time 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.510
 as extra soiled we wash 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.970
 Now about two hours and tinder 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.590
 I mean something or a long time ago 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.020
 maybe male ask if i want 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.090
 rinse a chicken extra intensively 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.790
 is often used with baby clothes 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.290
 which allow to get soap scum like you 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.630
 also sees another program from 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.930
 you can take a little longer yourself 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.560
 indicate how much you were , you see light 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.900
 contaminated 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.660
 you can see that the 41 minutes is meant 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.229
 what clarifies it is two o'clock 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.940
 extra fields was 2 hours and 20 minutes 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.100
 also you have a button it yourself it 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.240
 speed can be adjusted to 14 hours 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.840
 last up to 1400 or just completely 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.600
 do not run or even in the water 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.420
 to leave 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.950
 and if you use the flush stop then 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.270
 is here a pumping program 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.010
 a piece of nixon answered can of course 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.600
 door does not open moment there 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.440
 water is able to against the 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.440
 secured 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.600
 yes this whirlpool has sixth sense there 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.540
 are a number of sensors in the machine 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.170
 thus measures how much good you were in the 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.890
 washing machine stitch and it fits his 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.530
 time the job 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.100
 there was once an energy consumption on 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.440
 pass is one 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.970
 water use it on so we use it 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.840
 never too much 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.840
 with this eco machine 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.000
 before your dosing advice is possible 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.760
 you must use single moment 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.270
 adjust the water hardness in your 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.830
 neighborhood 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.360
 is all in the manual how and 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.660
 then some and of course you have to 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.340
 tell which type were you using more 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.870
 do it once then specify whether 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.280
 completely neat 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.330
 dosing proposal lot never too much 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.330
 detergent appears 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.820
 has loaded a left one above the sea 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.430
 with the front on the right was black 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.680
 one is in the middle of the 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.810
 she was softer and true on the left 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.180
 it it knows you state he has it 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.520
 detergent now there is another one 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.080
 hatch cement from a hatch in this one 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.060
 let's just lift them down 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.790
 at the moment we use liquid detergent 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.800
 when we were powdered 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.990
 we understand we put possible 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.260
 this kid also just nice to fish 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.210
 to hold 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.820
 we get this tab when we go down 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.530
 the drawer pulled out to a moment 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.020
 can leave the inside 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.790
 nice cleaning because that way 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.750
 at least this boy remains 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.750
 nice and fresh 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.720
 just the tip of washing machine.nl 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.120
 the filter once a month 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.620
 Clean and put your fingers in the 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.460
 bottom then you lift my for may 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.700
 you take the hood off then turned left 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.920
 brain open the filter it seems then 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.480
 of course some water but you 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.490
 are then always the lost coins 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.170

 turn it clockwise and have it 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.430
 completely or attach punctually 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.770
 a container 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.360
 keep it underneath and so puts it champion 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.020
 back and at least this boy stays that way 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.020
