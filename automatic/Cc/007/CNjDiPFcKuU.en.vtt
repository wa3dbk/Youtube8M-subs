showing<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> normally<00:00:10.080> operating

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
showing you is a normally operating

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.009 
showing you is a normally operating
transmission<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.790> transmission<00:00:12.690> has<00:00:12.840> no

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
transmission this transmission has no

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.620 
transmission this transmission has no
issues<00:00:13.559> pressure<00:00:14.460> solenoid<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.360> just

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
issues pressure solenoid was just

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.660 
issues pressure solenoid was just
replaced<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.350> looking<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> base<00:00:17.070> line<00:00:17.400> so

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
replaced I'm looking for a base line so

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
replaced I'm looking for a base line so
I<00:00:17.699> can<00:00:17.940> diagnose<00:00:18.390> another<00:00:18.690> car<00:00:19.050> off<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I can diagnose another car off of this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
I can diagnose another car off of this
and<00:00:20.390> just<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> make<00:00:21.570> sure<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:21.960> what

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and just to make sure what I know what

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.779 
and just to make sure what I know what
I'm<00:00:22.170> doing<00:00:22.500> when<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.740> hook<00:00:23.100> up<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> car<00:00:23.490> with

I'm doing when I hook up to the car with

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
I'm doing when I hook up to the car with
transmission<00:00:24.359> problems<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:25.980> see<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
transmission problems as you can see I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.410 
transmission problems as you can see I
got<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> chart<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:28.939> I'll<00:00:29.939> show<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> hook

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

line pressure Parker in first neutral is
223<00:00:42.750> at<00:00:42.840> 271<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> we'll<00:00:45.149> check<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> minimum

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
223 at 271 so we'll check the minimum

we<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.579> disconnect<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.480> connector<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
we will disconnect the connector at the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.790 
we will disconnect the connector at the
transmission<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> transaxle<00:00:54.329> case

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360 
transmission here the transaxle case
connector<00:00:57.379> right<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> side<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
connector right here on the side and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
connector right here on the side and
then<00:00:59.609> we'll<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.059> maximum<00:01:00.660> line<00:01:00.870> pressure

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
then we'll see maximum line pressure

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.219 
then we'll see maximum line pressure
with<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> car<00:01:01.649> running<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:03.049> like<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> said

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
with the car running which like I said

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.870 
with the car running which like I said
the<00:01:04.589> 223<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:06.119> 271

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
the 223 to 271

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.090 
the 223 to 271
all<00:01:08.420> right<00:01:08.540> let<00:01:08.659> me<00:01:08.689> show<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.930> hook<00:01:09.080> up<00:01:09.229> got<00:01:10.070> a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
all right let me show you hook up got a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700 
all right let me show you hook up got a
pressure<00:01:10.670> gauge<00:01:10.939> set<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.570> think<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.500> oil

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
pressure gauge set I think this is oil

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.609 
pressure gauge set I think this is oil
pressure<00:01:13.009> as<00:01:13.220> well<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:14.630> screws<00:01:14.990> into<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.350> top

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
pressure as well it screws into the top

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.800 
pressure as well it screws into the top
of<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.830> transmission<00:01:16.659> there's<00:01:17.659> like<00:01:17.780> a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
of the transmission there's like a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.359 
of the transmission there's like a
little<00:01:18.049> plug<00:01:18.470> EEP<00:01:18.680> ol<00:01:18.890> out<00:01:20.619> see<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.890> there

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.859 

all<00:01:28.369> right<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.729> comes<00:01:28.759> out<00:01:29.060> with<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.390> 11

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
all right it comes out with the 11

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.020 
all right it comes out with the 11
millimeter<00:01:31.810> socket

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
millimeter socket

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.400 
millimeter socket
and<00:01:34.360> like<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.630> said<00:01:34.750> you'd<00:01:35.020> screw<00:01:35.260> your

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
and like I said you'd screw your

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.050 
and like I said you'd screw your
pressure<00:01:35.620> gauge<00:01:35.740> in<00:01:36.100> there<00:01:36.310> I'll<00:01:36.610> show<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.880> it

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
pressure gauge in there I'll show you it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.350 
pressure gauge in there I'll show you it
running<00:01:37.360> though<00:01:38.190> here<00:01:39.190> we<00:01:39.250> go<00:01:39.430> cars<00:01:39.820> running

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360

disconnecting the bulkhead connector and
show<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.900> jump<00:01:59.140> in<00:01:59.230> pressure<00:01:59.530> this<00:02:00.250> will

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
show you the jump in pressure this will

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:25.500 
show you the jump in pressure this will
send<00:02:00.730> it<00:02:00.880> into<00:02:01.090> like<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.480> loop<00:02:01.780> mode
