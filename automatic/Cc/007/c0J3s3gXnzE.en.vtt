you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:11.930> one<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.200> doing<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
you can do one of them doing the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.429 
you can do one of them doing the
integrity<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> game<00:01:15.330> cache<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:16.140> whatnot

but<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.009> doesn't<00:01:17.280> work<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.640> everybody<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
but that doesn't work for everybody and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
but that doesn't work for everybody and
then<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.560> delete<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> file

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
then one of them is delete in the file

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
then one of them is delete in the file
which<00:01:20.820> doesn't<00:01:21.689> work<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.020> everybody<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.770> um

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
which doesn't work for everybody but um

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
which doesn't work for everybody but um
