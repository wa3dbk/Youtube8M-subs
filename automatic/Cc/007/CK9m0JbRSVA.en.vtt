00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.359
 -Anyone 一 環 still part of the release 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.909
 I am in transit but 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.599
 Large original 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.029
 It's small 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.880
 Well, my name doesn't come true 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.310
 I have that 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.529
 sc plan 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.110
 A little long but 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.290
 This festival is the bell of the tower 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.340
 That seahorse 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.330
 It is said that it is 222 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.250
 I have given that name 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.290
 When I say that systematic point 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 Before this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.920
 It's an offset 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.070
 Why not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.700
 Apply from today 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.520
 The axis of the board is good if it is eco-friendly 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.420
 Because it is addicted, the tip does not collapse 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.960
 Stay in the state of docomo 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 It is pointed out that it is not enough 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.850
 Yes, if you're calling from the side, listen to that as it flows 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 If you can 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.610
 If you can put a back like you beat down before that child 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 It is said that Shibata surpasses 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.240
 The place where everyone is talking to the alphanumeric of the map after 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.800
 I also have the role of my sister 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 Yes on the cover where the fish came off 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.980
 I feel like I'm being pulled by the weight of the fish 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.650
 Though 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.060
 Where it came off 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.510
 Well, hooks are also renewed in places where species come back 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.640
 Betray 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.369
 It is made in the hole punch 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.120
 The most about the future of the former members 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.680
 Made by f la people 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.860
 I went to drink 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.320
 That tip is naturally 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.450
 Whether it is good or bad 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.270
 That again 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.070
 This is an improvement but 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.650
 To Ohara side 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.700
 Distribute 2 metal plates 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.980
 Actually this is- 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.570
 It is owned by the upper house 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.670
 More than half of the data and it's in the afternoon so it's sensibly 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.739
 Which side 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.269
 That is over 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.569
 And two high school students 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.729
 Also this metal plate also has another role. 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.139
 It is about city wake up 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.139
 I named it Emma Zique, but 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.449
 Let's try Japanese beer 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.489
 Well, it's all in one here and this one 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.869
 Plate is metal 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.409
 I'm sorry 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.149
 For example, that angle is free 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:37.019
 Because you can answer 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.449
 Make a profit according to your style 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:41.379
 If you can 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.739
 This is another 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.809
 The frame is also the same built-in 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.179
 Can be fixed 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.869
 It should be also today 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.359
 I can listen again 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.769
 With this 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.629
 apt was outraged 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.349
 I can not change the angle freely 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.770
 According to this 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.909
 There is a place called 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 This is the bombing and Madrid costs Lek 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.579
 That body and set 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.510
 The breakthrough of the set of voice and the reward only for the main body 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.509
 Not tell 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.999
 I'm going to take a trip to the end of December and head to the end of December. 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:19.629
 Live 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.609
 Yeah 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.319
 You can
