 Hello everyone , I have millions just 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.770
 question on instagram about how 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.429
 I do my styling with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.769
 curls 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.080
 my hair is very fluffy now i have them 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 just washed and seen how dry they are 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.619
 curly naughty 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.529
 I think for most of you this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.410
 no secret how to do this styling yet 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 as there are a lot of questions about 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.449
 I have to shoot this video all the time 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.080
 every time i do this styling 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.620
 I'll do the simplest styling on my 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.750
 look I do gave me no time 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 to look good so that the hair 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 shone and were obedient to me like that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 curling iron 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.750
 absolutely ordinary philips with adjustable 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.680
 the temperature I put the bed to turn on 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.020
 I usually put on the average temperature 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.079
 I have only a maximum of 8 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.040
 I will leave for myself to four 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.920
 when i'm in no hurry turn on starts 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.580
 get warm and hair I pack only 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.369
 dry if you are styling your hair 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.229
 those who don't hold their hair very well 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 I can advise on styling 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.090
 means debugged called Olivier 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.180
 he was already shown this by his 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 shopping is such a thick mass is very 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.049
 nice it smells like me just 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 I love this smell not only that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.450
 means nourish hair well to everything 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 very well fixes curls here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.730
 I take so much 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:57.660
 but I rub my finger in the palms and 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:00.480
 shuna end here's an ear with this remedy 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.020
 preferably not perry you zoom because 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.330
 what not to overdo it because very well 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.810
 who feed it his way your buy 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.450
 I know not only to do 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.250
 styling well, just like caring such 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.530
 tool for tips because 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.910
 made up a lot of oils not not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.030
 will need some kind of extraordinary 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.130
 hairbrush ordinary massage brush which 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.470
 I use 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:34.220
 okay, why are you making your hair words 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:39.620
 normal parting I divide the hair in this part 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:43.280
 bolts are just as creepy as I am visually 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.430
 inside how spinning you have and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.920
 share here and they should not be very 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.330
 more precisely not something that is not very small but 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.800
 not quite small pretty large and 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.570
 probably the microphone is too much noise 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.160
 do for take after from the end begin 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.610
 friend some such pretty 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.610
 by the way a large strand and winds itself 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.330
 get some kind of onion 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.200
 leans back and take the next one 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.050
 strand 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.930
 so that the strands spin equally when 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:28.220
 you hinted the strand just think 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.580
 the same number of seconds 10-15-20 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.590
 who needs how much by the way here screwed up 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.450
 two strands from this side now take 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.830
 two strands from here in turn 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.140
 little by little we take gradually coming to 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.410
 to the hair that we have in front, I will read 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.239
 wound her hair here unfortunately bad 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.480
 visible and can not only show you everything 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.470
 sorry but i was just cheating 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.890
 cheat cheat 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.600
 and left two front strands they 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.970
 I look pretty volume 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.610
 this due to being 6 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.769
 hair a bit as you want you can 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.980
 take the very top and start twisting 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.709
 right from here but I like to let it go 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.080
 more van qing don't know this is super simple 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.970
 styling just if i have 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.019
 asks the lire will show you to do 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.519
 styling i can 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:25.270
 throw off a link to that video therefore 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.270
 take it off strands all twist away from myself 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.790
 for those who have very smooth hair 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:41.160
 You can do the varnish I do not varnish because 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:44.169
 that he has everything tight so well kept 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.510
 on so here those with whom poorly holds 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.240
 hair at this stage can be poked 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.400
 varnish on it some kind of steel fixation 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.790
 good lucky very January in such white 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.800
 packings they are made to touch 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.830
 no less hair can move them 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.080
 comb they are soft now I'm you 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.150
 I probably won't show the flag because 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.970
 that it is necessary to look for him for a long time, a good varnish 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.310
 loreal killed and packing so i'm waiting for now 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.990
 hair will dry up 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.180
 never leave curls just like that 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.600
 be sure to comb them now I 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.810
 I'll take a droplet of this silk father 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.380
 silkin fusion whose and start hands like this 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:29.139
 here you are combing your hair and now one of 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.570
 the most important steps of this styling though 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.460
 principle, you can stop at this i 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.470
 combing hair the main thing is not 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.150
 fear because everyone thinks about can 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.690
 why did I twist everything then 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.690
 to comb 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.850
 here you can smear a little remnants 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:58.699
 silk or any butter there some 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.820
 mystic is only Morocco but so 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.669
 Actually we and the waves that I imagine 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.009
 always doing like this they look very 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.820
 naturally harmoniously beautiful hair 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:15.880
 shiny after this is possible for 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:18.229
 day hide and seek will disintegrate a little but 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.620
 that's how I really like to do 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:25.330
 laying can be parted to another 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:30.020
 something like that 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.160
 such a wave will be beautiful 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.289
 wanted to show 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.360
 and most importantly , I repeat it again 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.599
 comb hair do not leave these 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.580
 taped Lviv strands that 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:43.310
 In principle, now such styling is no one 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.610
 doesn't do it my daily styling 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.979
