custom pc review and today i'm going to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.080 
custom pc review and today i'm going to
show<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.040> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.370> install<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.970> cpu<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.870> memory

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
show you how to install a cpu and memory

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.790 
show you how to install a cpu and memory
before<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.240> begin<00:00:09.389> please<00:00:09.840> ensure<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.650> have

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
before we begin please ensure you have

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.509 
before we begin please ensure you have
the<00:00:11.010> motherboard<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.820> compatible<00:00:12.690> cpu<00:00:13.200> and

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
the motherboard a compatible cpu and

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.210 
the motherboard a compatible cpu and
compatible<00:00:14.519> memory<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.470> first<00:00:19.740> step<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
compatible memory the first step is to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980 
compatible memory the first step is to
remove<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.789> motherboard<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
remove the motherboard from the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
remove the motherboard from the
motherboard<00:00:22.560> box<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.189> place<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
motherboard box and place it on a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.170 
motherboard box and place it on a
non-static<00:00:25.080> surface<00:00:25.680> such<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.670> top<00:00:26.939> of

non-static surface such as the top of

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
non-static surface such as the top of
your<00:00:27.300> motherboard<00:00:27.840> box<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> next<00:00:34.770> step<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
your motherboard box the next step is to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
your motherboard box the next step is to
find<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> CPU<00:00:36.210> socket<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.989> motherboard

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
find the CPU socket on the motherboard

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
find the CPU socket on the motherboard
if<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.340> purchased<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.850> motherboard<00:00:39.390> new<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
if you purchased your motherboard new it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
if you purchased your motherboard new it
should<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.500> include<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.190> socket<00:00:41.640> cover<00:00:41.850> as

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to open the CPU socket you may now

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.510 
to open the CPU socket you may now
remove<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> CPU<00:00:56.340> socket<00:00:56.789> cover<00:01:00.949> next<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
remove the CPU socket cover next take a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.870 
remove the CPU socket cover next take a
look<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> CPU<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.430> CPU

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
look at the CPU as you can see the CPU

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
look at the CPU as you can see the CPU
includes<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.720> notches<00:01:07.580> additionally<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
includes two notches additionally you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.030 
includes two notches additionally you
will<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> small<00:01:09.659> triangle<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.320> bottom<00:01:10.799> left

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
will see a small triangle on bottom left

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
will see a small triangle on bottom left
side<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> CPU<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.869> notches<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
side of the CPU these notches and the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
side of the CPU these notches and the
triangle<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.909> ensure<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.479> install

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
triangle will ensure that you install

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.730 
triangle will ensure that you install
the<00:01:16.170> CPU<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.860> correct<00:01:17.220> way<00:01:21.500> while<00:01:22.500> only

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the CPU the correct way while only

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
the CPU the correct way while only
touching<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> sides<00:01:23.580> four<00:01:23.939> corners<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
touching the sides four corners of the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.980 
touching the sides four corners of the
CPU<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.189> may<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.520> drop<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> CPU<00:01:27.479> into<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
CPU you may now drop the CPU into the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
CPU you may now drop the CPU into the
socket<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:29.189> sure<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.909> touch<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
socket make sure you do not touch the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.440 
socket make sure you do not touch the
top<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.170> bottom<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> CPU<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.939> oil<00:01:33.150> from

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
top or bottom of the CPU as the oil from

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
top or bottom of the CPU as the oil from
your<00:01:33.479> hands<00:01:33.990> may<00:01:34.409> affect<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> CPUs

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
your hands may affect the CPUs

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.109 
your hands may affect the CPUs
performance<00:01:36.710> now<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.310> may<00:01:38.490> drop<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> lever

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
performance now you may drop the lever

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
performance now you may drop the lever
and<00:01:39.390> push<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> bottom<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
and push it to the bottom and to the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.660 
and push it to the bottom and to the
left<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.880> lock<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> CPU<00:01:42.720> into<00:01:43.170> place

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.210 

the<00:01:47.270> next<00:01:47.600> step<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.170> install<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.770> cpu

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
the next step is to install the cpu

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.140 
with the four holes on the motherboard
now<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.739> may<00:02:09.890> push<00:02:10.130> down<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.670> four<00:02:10.880> pins

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
now you may push down on the four pins

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.449 
now you may push down on the four pins
until<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.720> hear<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:11.989> click<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.980> means<00:02:13.310> that

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
until you hear a click this means that

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:25.780 
until you hear a click this means that
the<00:02:13.610> heating<00:02:14.030> fan<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.480> now<00:02:14.750> locked<00:02:15.050> into<00:02:15.410> place

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.300 

next<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:49.630> will<00:02:49.810> install<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.349> memory<00:02:50.530> this

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
next we will install the memory this

next we will install the memory this
motherboard<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.060> cpu<00:02:52.120> uses<00:02:53.050> dual<00:02:53.319> channel

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
motherboard and cpu uses dual channel

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.130 
motherboard and cpu uses dual channel
