does<00:03:35.800> very<00:03:36.130> well<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.670> brown<00:03:37.290> as<00:03:38.700> opposed

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
does very well with the brown as opposed

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.700 
does very well with the brown as opposed
to<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.970> white<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:42.250> white<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.490> nice<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.590> I

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
to the white the white is nice but I

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.240 
to the white the white is nice but I
just<00:03:44.890> think<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.550> better<00:03:45.790> way<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.090> roll

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
just think this is a better way to roll
