00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the problem with this is it's so round

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010

because<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.240> actually<00:01:45.689> meant<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> be

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
because this is actually meant to be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.740 
because this is actually meant to be
sewn<00:01:46.409> same<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> want<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> use

sewn same as this but if you want to use

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.160 
sewn same as this but if you want to use
this<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.630> when<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this you can but when you get to the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.399 
this you can but when you get to the
edges<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.770> come<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.380> for<00:01:55.380> a
