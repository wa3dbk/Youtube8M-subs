permanent I will find a better way to
fix<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:06.110> actually<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:08.100> type<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
fix this and actually this type of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
fix this and actually this type of
cartridge<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.780> suited<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
cartridge is really not suited for this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.719 
cartridge is really not suited for this
type<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.549> record<00:01:12.090> player<00:01:12.360> anyway<00:01:12.869> because

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
type of record player anyway because

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.969 
type of record player anyway because
these<00:01:14.729> record<00:01:15.210> players<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> single<00:01:16.680> stage

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
these record players use a single stage

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.490 
these record players use a single stage
amp<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:19.310> they<00:01:20.310> require<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> high<00:01:21.270> output

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
amp and they require a high output

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
amp and they require a high output
cartridge<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:23.000> produces<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> order<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
cartridge that produces in the order of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
cartridge that produces in the order of
two<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> three<00:01:25.020> volts<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.890> give<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.189> full

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
two to three volts to give you full

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.870 
two to three volts to give you full
volume<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:28.170> type<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.740> cartridge<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.520> only

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
volume this type of cartridge here only

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
volume this type of cartridge here only
produces<00:01:30.540> about<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> half<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> volt<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> have

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
produces about a half a volt so you have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
produces about a half a volt so you have
to<00:01:32.880> crank<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> volume<00:01:33.659> control<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> way

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to crank the volume control all the way

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
to crank the volume control all the way
up<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:36.630> any<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> reasonable<00:01:37.530> sound

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
up to get any kind of reasonable sound

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.910 
up to get any kind of reasonable sound
out<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
out of it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
out of it
your<00:01:40.920> other<00:01:41.070> option<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.180> add<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
your other option would be to add a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.370 
your other option would be to add a
preamp<00:01:43.290> stage<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.509> existing<00:01:45.509> amplifier

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
preamp stage to the existing amplifier

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.120 
preamp stage to the existing amplifier
chassis<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.430> done<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.970> before<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
chassis and I have done that before I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.410 
chassis and I have done that before I
just<00:01:50.130> use<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> 6<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.659> v60<00:01:52.409> behead<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> output

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
just use a 6 a v60 behead of the output

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.679 
just use a 6 a v60 behead of the output
stage<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:55.890> allow<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.430> use<00:01:56.820> one

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
stage and that will allow you to use one

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.039 
stage and that will allow you to use one
of<00:01:57.719> these<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:58.140> modern<00:01:58.310> cartridges<00:02:00.049> here's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
of these more modern cartridges here's

I'll use a six a v6 preamp stage and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.020 
I'll use a six a v6 preamp stage and
that<00:04:17.209> will<00:04:17.359> allow<00:04:17.630> us<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.019> use<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.640> modern<00:04:19.640> low
