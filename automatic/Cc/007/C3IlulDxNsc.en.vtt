Ichiban which each - means number one or
the<00:03:38.400> best<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.840> picked<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.140> up<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.440> it

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
the best so I just picked it up and it

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.130 
the best so I just picked it up and it
was<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.280> Saito<00:03:41.520> brand<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.240> figured<00:03:42.959> I

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
was just a Saito brand so I figured I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.060 
was just a Saito brand so I figured I
could<00:03:43.170> rely<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:43.590> it

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
could rely on it

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.220 
could rely on it
I've<00:03:44.250> actually<00:03:44.430> been<00:03:44.730> mixing<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.110> my

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
I've actually been mixing this with my

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.320 
I've actually been mixing this with my
regular<00:03:46.410> foundation<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.520> it<00:03:47.970> gives<00:03:48.120> me<00:03:48.300> a

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
regular foundation and it gives me a

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.390 
regular foundation and it gives me a
nice<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:49.050> of<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.170> dewy<00:03:49.530> glow<00:03:49.920> without

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
nice kind of like dewy glow without

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.960 
nice kind of like dewy glow without
overdoing<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.330> oh<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.739> got<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.340> eyelash

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
overdoing it oh I got this eyelash

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.350 
overdoing it oh I got this eyelash
curler<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.959> they<00:03:55.770> had<00:03:55.980> several<00:03:56.280> ones<00:03:56.820> there<00:03:57.180> I

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
curler and they had several ones there I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.210 
curler and they had several ones there I
got<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.690> most<00:03:57.840> expensive<00:03:58.019> one<00:03:58.650> because<00:03:59.100> I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
got the most expensive one because I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.420 
got the most expensive one because I
figured<00:03:59.640> it's<00:04:00.600> probably<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.380> best<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.400> I

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
figured it's probably the best so I

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.290 
figured it's probably the best so I
haven't<00:04:02.880> tried<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.269> yet<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:05.280> know<00:04:05.850> I'm

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300
