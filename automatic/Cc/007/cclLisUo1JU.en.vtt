50 to 75 or so who's the driver that's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:58.299 
50 to 75 or so who's the driver that's
300

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.819

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.690 

shutting<00:02:30.290> off<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:30.680> hit<00:02:31.070> much<00:02:31.220> other<00:02:31.430> one<00:02:31.580> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
shutting off or hit much other one to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:42.199 
shutting off or hit much other one to
watch<00:02:31.730> yeah

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.490 

140<00:02:43.079> watt<00:02:43.260> RMS<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.540> 141<00:02:46.290> mice

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
140 watt RMS so it's you know 141 mice

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.860 
140 watt RMS so it's you know 141 mice
at<00:02:46.829> 4<00:02:47.099> ohms<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.549> bright<00:02:47.790> 300<00:02:48.269> watt<00:02:48.360> amp<00:02:48.599> so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
at 4 ohms it's bright 300 watt amp so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.960 
at 4 ohms it's bright 300 watt amp so
they're<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.099> for<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.489> bridge<00:02:50.730> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
they're just in for if you bridge it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.819 
they're just in for if you bridge it
bring<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.329> down<00:02:51.450> there<00:02:51.659> like<00:02:51.750> 2<00:02:51.989> or<00:02:52.019> 0<00:02:52.560> ohms

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
bring it down there like 2 or 0 ohms

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.630 
bring it down there like 2 or 0 ohms
it'd<00:02:53.189> probably<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:54.110> probably<00:02:55.110> put<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.640> you

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
it'd probably be probably put out you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.429 
it'd probably be probably put out you
know<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.879> full<00:02:57.060> power<00:02:57.269> 300<00:02:57.989> buddy<00:02:58.200> baby

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
know the full power 300 buddy baby

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.979 
know the full power 300 buddy baby
putting<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> lot<00:02:59.640> when<00:02:59.909> it's<00:03:00.030> bridge<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
putting on a lot when it's bridge the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.449 
putting on a lot when it's bridge the
only<00:03:01.140> problem<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.769> gets<00:03:01.890> he<00:03:02.010> developer

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
only problem that it gets he developer

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.160 
only problem that it gets he developer
that's<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.819> key<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.569> get<00:03:03.659> a<00:03:03.720> lot<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.049> power

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that's the key you get a lot of power

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.860 
that's the key you get a lot of power
water<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.010> gonna<00:03:05.129> be<00:03:05.370> that's<00:03:05.489> Alpine<00:03:06.090> yeah

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
water so I'm gonna be that's Alpine yeah

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
water so I'm gonna be that's Alpine yeah
you're<00:03:07.409> probably<00:03:07.859> not<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.159> to<00:03:08.220> get

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
you're probably not going to get

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759 
you're probably not going to get
anything<00:03:08.549> wrong<00:03:08.819> with<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.150> right<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.590> one

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
anything wrong with this right this one

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:18.200 
anything wrong with this right this one
actually<00:03:10.890> works<00:03:11.670> real<00:03:11.879> good<00:03:12.439> ok<00:03:15.019> 2<00:03:16.019> down
