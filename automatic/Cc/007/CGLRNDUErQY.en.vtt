 technology at the phones and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.949
 if it's a phone finally the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.390
 builders are Japanese so that's 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 these Japanese so I did not study the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 Japanese so I could not succeed 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.820
 in any case it's fujitsu something like 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.469

 what people there are who we 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 Europeans it's impossible this with 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.949
 nally we take several hours 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 one two three or even 10 hours for his 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 end some smartphones to charge

 phone there and then after giving you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.360
 my opinion attentive staff a review 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.130
 who is not professional I am far 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.470
 to be professional so here is so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.700
 it's really taking the tweezers I 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.680
 think the liver say it like that or at the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.030
 light so it's gone with the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 information that concerned about the problem 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 major smartphone the autonomy the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.890
 fujitsu firm actually to work 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 on it and find a solution 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 alternative of improving 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.280
 speed of reloading the terminal 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 with a technology to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.570
 recharge your device to deez in 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 barely ten minutes for that the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.829
 foot us or arosa use a battery 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.140
 so house of 2600 mhz and millan plr 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.450
 so to dj adapter all this more than the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.820
 website refills and so completely there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.439
 can hold three days non-stop so 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.980
 a feat in the field it's true 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.060
 we can 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.650
 to say well yeah ten minutes they get 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.110
 charge ball to the autonomy of the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.700
 battery will not be huge, bah 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.500
 finally if there will be a big enough 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 autonomy but that's not all we 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 that a the fujitsu hours to own so 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.890
 very nice features 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.200
 with a screen ij zoo so 2.5 inches 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.360
 so what is rather big enough 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.900
 having a resolution full hd 1920 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.130
 x 1080 pixels resolution of quality 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.140
 finally screen resolution 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.280
 it's a very good resolution a / c this 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
 that we now find on all 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.270
 latest iphone 5 phones is all that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.310
 lé as I am also on the whole 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.860
 new very latest samsung 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.460
 nokia own processor quadricore call 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.050
 like a snapdragon s1800 clocked at 2.23 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.760
 gigahertz hong kong where he has a 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.580
 power just very huge people there 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 has nothing to say about the power 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.910
 supported by two gigabytes of memory 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.550
 long live so Hungarian why so basically 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.520
 there are 2 gigas of ram if you want so 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.230
 that a 3 megapixel camera me 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.030
 it makes me a reference between a merger 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.950
 with actually if you want the iphone 5 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.470
 coins with the latest samsung 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.540
 if I believe if I say not anything 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.860
 it's going to be the bare tablet to the tablet 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.360
 3 or something like that it's horrible 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.700
 because there the characteristics of this 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.680
 beautiful phone are very very good 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.870
 yesterday there is not much to say the airlock 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.130
 about the features there what he 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.510
 be aware that there is no price 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.310
 actually about the phone 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.370
 there is no date so it's really 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.860
 a concept actually that was started by 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.830
 fujitsu to waterze in japan and 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.710
 unfortunately for now 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.690
 the trade will end web the sale of 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.370
 this game of his phones there will be 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.980
 that in Japan maybe after if there is a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.780
 big a big buzz there and well 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.580
 maybe it will come too and well 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.020
 in European trade but for 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.610
 the moment is dedicated to Japan 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.440
 so me net me I think it's a 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.460
 good idea it can be fine 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.780
 would be that because the reloads 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.340
 it's over to change your 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.960
 phones if you realize 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.490
 see me on my side I'm looking for all 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.130
 evenings before bedtime even I leave 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.660
 my catch on at night and that can you 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.280
 save you just put it 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.260
 before going to bed while I know 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.340
 not you put it reload tac ten 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.840
 minutes after I do not know during this 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.310
 time you take your shower you 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.550
 receive in you do things like 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.070
 it 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.840
 you come back and well your phones will be 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.730
 almost full and it saves you from 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.500
 rotate everything held good I think 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.330
 for seniors people like us in 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.989
 go people to these young people all that one 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.790
 do not care a bit 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.580
 but for low parents it allows them 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.990
 to save a few cents that go 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.460
 become happy and dozens 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 of euros and maybe even a hundred 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.430
 euros and well at the end of the year and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.450
 yeah so throw your parents yeah yeah 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.980
 I laugh nan 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.840
 this is our hearts frankly I find 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.220
 it's a good concept after you really have to 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.610
 see it's autonomy that's what they 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.830
 say 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.930
 normally yes so that's after that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.460
 depends because he says three days 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.780
 but maybe three days if you do not 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.680
 do not touch the phone at that is that 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.570
 when you are going to launch a 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.500
 application and baala it will be two days 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.610
 One day 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.020
 me anyway if you here you hold 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.400
 already the day a bit like now 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.990
 why all devices and well what 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.760
 would be really neat and after with 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.960
 ten minutes of reloading that's by 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.669
 against the concern for now times the 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.570
 in Japan he comes back from Japan to 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.640
 to be able to get 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.830
 so yeah that's maybe not all of 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.230
 next but it sells its technology 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.330
 ahead happens that happens that's okay 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.100
 it's going to happen so in the trade 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.270
 European all to what I hope in everything 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.130
 case because I find that the concept 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.390
 is rather is pretty good on it 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 thank you thank you to all of you put a small 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.970
 dog sick of it is super fun 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.710
 especially did not get on fishing and 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.030
 staff merce to believe more added 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.030
 at the pressure and the showbizz house
