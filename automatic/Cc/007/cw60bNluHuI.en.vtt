why one of the biggest advantages of
weight<00:00:26.369> training<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> helps

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
weight training is that it helps

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019

which is your basal metabolic rate which
is<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> number<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> calories<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> burn

the number of calories that you burned
at<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.370> gym<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> remember<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
at the gym but you have to remember is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
at the gym but you have to remember is
that<00:00:40.469> your<00:00:40.829> body<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> constantly<00:00:41.730> burning

week weight training helps accelerate

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.090 
week weight training helps accelerate
this<00:00:48.510> calorie<00:00:48.960> burning<00:00:49.289> process<00:00:49.590> because

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this calorie burning process because

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.420 
this calorie burning process because
when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.550> weight<00:00:51.180> train<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:52.559> need

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
when you weight train you actually need

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
when you weight train you actually need
time<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.969> repair<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.449> muscles<00:00:55.079> once<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
time to repair your muscles once you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
time to repair your muscles once you
break<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> body<00:00:56.760> works<00:00:57.030> really

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
break them down so the body works really

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.880 
break them down so the body works really
hard<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.719> repair<00:00:58.050> itself<00:00:58.350> does<00:00:58.649> help

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
hard to repair itself does help

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.200 
hard to repair itself does help
increasing<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> number<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.730> calories<00:00:59.940> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
increasing the number of calories that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
increasing the number of calories that
you<00:01:00.239> burn<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.690> rest<00:01:00.930> another<00:01:01.590> big<00:01:01.859> advantage

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you burn at rest another big advantage

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
you burn at rest another big advantage
of<00:01:02.370> weight<00:01:02.579> training<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> typically<00:01:03.660> any

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
of weight training is that typically any

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
of weight training is that typically any
weight<00:01:04.710> loss<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.610> typically<00:01:05.909> from

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
weight loss from that is typically from

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
weight loss from that is typically from
fat<00:01:06.450> whereas<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.580> cardio<00:01:09.119> you're

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
fat whereas when you do cardio you're

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
fat whereas when you do cardio you're
burning<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> ton<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> calories<00:01:10.409> but

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
burning a ton of calories but

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.609 
burning a ton of calories but
unfortunately<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:12.000> burning<00:01:12.330> away<00:01:12.619> muscle

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
unfortunately you're burning away muscle

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
unfortunately you're burning away muscle
as<00:01:13.770> well<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.549> yeah<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> say

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
as well so yeah I'm not going to say

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
as well so yeah I'm not going to say
cardio<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.290> bad<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.520> great<00:01:17.790> for

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
cardio is bad because it is great for

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
cardio is bad because it is great for
you<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> helps<00:01:18.360> lower<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.810> blood<00:01:18.930> pressure

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you it helps lower your blood pressure

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
you it helps lower your blood pressure
it's<00:01:19.470> good<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:19.950> lungs<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.670> your

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
heart but if you want to accelerate your

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
heart but if you want to accelerate your
BMR<00:01:24.540> metabolism<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> definitely<00:01:25.799> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> do

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
BMR metabolism you definitely want to do

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
BMR metabolism you definitely want to do
some<00:01:26.280> weight<00:01:26.490> training<00:01:26.939> doing<00:01:27.509> too<00:01:27.810> much

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
some weight training doing too much

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.840 
some weight training doing too much
cardio<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:29.159> eat<00:01:29.189> away<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.640> your

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
cardio will actually eat away at your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.550 
cardio will actually eat away at your
muscle<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> counterproductive<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
muscle which is counterproductive in the
