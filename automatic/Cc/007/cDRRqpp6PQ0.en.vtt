00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.620 

and<00:02:13.090> so

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
and so

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.070 
and so
now<00:02:15.230> you're<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.040> take<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:17.020> throw<00:02:18.020> that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
now you're going to take that throw that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.800 
now you're going to take that throw that
you<00:02:18.440> loot

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.460 

simple<00:02:25.770> loop

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
simple loop

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.420 
simple loop
and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.290 

you<00:02:30.939> know<00:02:31.150> not<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.870> take<00:02:32.859> it<00:02:32.890> off

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.780 

and<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.140> tie<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.190> around<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.870> park

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and going to tie it around the park

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.630 
and going to tie it around the park
closer<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.210> root<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.340> hair<00:02:44.490> that's

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
closer to the root so the hair that's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:56.360 
closer to the root so the hair that's
wrapped<00:02:44.970> around<00:02:45.090> stay<00:02:45.540> secure

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.729 

does<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.120> come<00:02:57.209> out<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:58.190> don't<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.459> though

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
does it come out so don't do that though

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.690 
does it come out so don't do that though
what<00:03:01.739> you're<00:03:01.890> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.069> do<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.370> you're<00:03:02.580> going

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.660 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:03:02.760> take<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.060> excess

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.000 

if<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.180> could<00:03:09.240> ever<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:10.170> them<00:03:10.319> back<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.800> day

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
if I could ever get them back up one day

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.860 
if I could ever get them back up one day
and<00:03:11.810> you're<00:03:12.810> going<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.140> another<00:03:14.870> you're

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
and you're going to do another you're
