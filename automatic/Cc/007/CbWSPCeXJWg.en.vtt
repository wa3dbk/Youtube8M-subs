 between numbers and his shirt came the 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.520
 time of leave the posting e 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.920
 friendly but still painful not yes 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.260
 they can easily forget 70 years 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.950
 of history and tomorrow is the last day 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.990
 of the Italian presence in Africa 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.330
 no nostalgia but a bit of melancholy 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.369
 tempered by the awareness of having so much 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.669
 more given than we received 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.379
 to Somalis and other Africans 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.199
 Italy does not leave the memory of one 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.870
 greedy and exploitative colonial power 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.909
 poor country, Somalia twice 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 Italy and with a population equal to 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.780
 that of Naples alone 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.449
 these visions show us some areas 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.329
 flooded by the floods of the rivers but of 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.100
 the lands are usually burned by the sun 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 fertile along the ju there is vice handsome o 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.280
 in areas where Italian labor has 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.749
 open 500 wells and irrigation canals 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.519
 the aridity of the land forces three 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.309
 one out of four Somalis living of the 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.189
 pastoralism or hunting are nomadic 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.530
 more slaves than masters of flocks and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.630
 of herds and are ill-suited to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.670
 turn into peasants even in the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.979
 places like in agricultural districts 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 created by the Italians along the rivers where 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.329
 the black lands promise crops 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 abundant bananas 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.039
 here is the most important crop the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.189
 Somali- type cavendish banana not 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.359
 very large but fragrant and tasty 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 ripping the ground to the bush e 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.890
 procuring water the Italians have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.409
 raised model bananas that give 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.570
 and for a long time still they will give all 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.789
 bananas for our tables 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.560
 the monopoly company that insures bananas 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.899
 the presence of the tropical fruit on the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.850
 Italian market follows the whole cycle 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.460
 of production from palm to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.259
 retail cutting 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.759
 helmets happens when they are still green 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.469
 so that everything comes to 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.970
 ripening during the period 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.670
 necessary to do so 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
 the consumer is not always a calculation 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.140
 easy and also the packaging and the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.150
 transport presents difficulties because 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.280
 the coral reef does not allow 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.830
 direct boarding on ships is a matter of course 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.810
 equipped with refrigeration systems that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.160
 ensure constant temperature during 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.160
 the two weeks of travel 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.640
 each of us Italians eats a kilo 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.710
 and a half of bananas a year 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.850
 it is a much lower consumption 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.860
 to that of other European countries the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.680
 Somalia does not have ports to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.350
 mogadishu to chisimaio to merka brava le 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.570
 ships cannot dock the transhipment 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.610
 of men and things happens with
