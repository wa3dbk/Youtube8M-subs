okay<00:00:07.090> I<00:00:07.629> think<00:00:08.049> a<00:00:08.320> lot<00:00:08.469> of<00:00:08.559> times<00:00:08.770> people

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
okay I think a lot of times people

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.709 
okay I think a lot of times people
forget<00:00:09.460> that<00:00:09.639> even<00:00:09.850> though<00:00:10.090> cars<00:00:10.389> or

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
forget that even though cars or

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.560 
forget that even though cars or
mechanical<00:00:11.559> machines<00:00:11.920> there<00:00:12.160> are<00:00:12.190> a<00:00:12.250> lot<00:00:12.459> of

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
mechanical machines there are a lot of

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.699 
mechanical machines there are a lot of
electrical<00:00:13.570> components<00:00:13.750> that<00:00:14.320> are<00:00:14.440> on<00:00:14.559> the

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
electrical components that are on the

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.830 
electrical components that are on the
inside<00:00:14.860> and<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:15.639> throughout<00:00:16.359> the<00:00:16.570> car

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
inside and and throughout the car

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.480 
inside and and throughout the car
especially<00:00:17.109> as<00:00:17.500> you<00:00:17.680> get<00:00:17.859> newer<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.460> newer

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
especially as you get newer and newer

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.249 
especially as you get newer and newer
models<00:00:19.150> there's<00:00:19.449> more<00:00:19.689> electrical

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
models there's more electrical

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.820 
models there's more electrical
components<00:00:20.800> on<00:00:20.949> the<00:00:21.099> inside<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:23.199> therefore

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
components on the inside so therefore

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.339 
components on the inside so therefore
there<00:00:24.160> are<00:00:24.390> occasions<00:00:25.390> in<00:00:25.599> which<00:00:25.630> electrical

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
there are occasions in which electrical

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.989 
there are occasions in which electrical
components<00:00:26.890> go<00:00:27.009> bad<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.400> you<00:00:27.460> need<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.759> fix

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
components go bad and you need to fix

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.019 
components go bad and you need to fix
them<00:00:28.409> today<00:00:29.409> what<00:00:29.710> we<00:00:29.859> have<00:00:30.070> here<00:00:30.400> is<00:00:30.519> a<00:00:30.550> Toyota

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.070 

okay<00:03:25.890> once<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.310> pop<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.819> panel<00:03:27.180> you're<00:03:27.900> going

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
okay once you pop the panel you're going

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.600 
okay once you pop the panel you're going
to<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.440> figure<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:28.950> which<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
to have to figure out which one of the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.660 
to have to figure out which one of the
wires<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.240> here<00:03:30.600> are<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.470> wires<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.920> connect

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
wires in here are the wires that connect

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.360 
wires in here are the wires that connect
the<00:03:33.000> brake<00:03:33.569> light<00:03:33.840> switch<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:35.190> isn't

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the brake light switch and that isn't

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.110 
the brake light switch and that isn't
exactly<00:03:35.970> easy<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.569> do<00:03:36.810> unless<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
exactly easy to do unless you have the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.320 
exactly easy to do unless you have the
replacements<00:03:39.810> which<00:03:40.020> already<00:03:40.760> by<00:03:41.760> feeling

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
replacements which already by feeling

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.550 
replacements which already by feeling
around<00:03:42.600> inside<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.380> compartment<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.310> here

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
around inside of the compartment in here

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.350 
around inside of the compartment in here
you<00:03:46.560> should<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:47.010> able<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.340> feel<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.150> brake

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
you should be able to feel the brake

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.750 
you should be able to feel the brake
light<00:03:48.600> switch<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.320> there<00:03:49.650> should<00:03:49.920> feel<00:03:50.160> pretty

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
light switch in there should feel pretty

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.120 
light switch in there should feel pretty
similar<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.500> same<00:03:52.709> feeling<00:03:53.100> you

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
similar to you know the same feeling you

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.770 
similar to you know the same feeling you
should<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.489> when<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:53.730> touch<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
should get when you touch this

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.410 
should get when you touch this
replacement<00:03:55.380> brake<00:03:55.800> light<00:03:56.010> switch<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.550> so

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
replacement brake light switch and so

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.000 
replacement brake light switch and so
based<00:03:57.690> off<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:58.410> was<00:03:58.709> able<00:03:58.860> to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
based off of that I was able to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.430 
based off of that I was able to
determine<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.870> connector

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
determine that this is the connector

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.820 
determine that this is the connector
here<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.880> holding<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.780> brake<00:04:04.230> light<00:04:04.530> or

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
here that is holding the brake light or

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.259 
here that is holding the brake light or
that<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.310> connecting<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> brake<00:04:06.090> light

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
that is connecting the brake light

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.420 
that is connecting the brake light
switch<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> rest<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.260> car<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:08.190> what

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
switch to the rest of the car so what

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
switch to the rest of the car so what
I'm<00:04:08.519> going<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.670> do<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:08.970> go<00:04:09.120> ahead<00:04:09.209> and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
I'm going to do is go ahead and

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.500 
I'm going to do is go ahead and
disconnect<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:13.489> before<00:04:14.489> accessing<00:04:15.120> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
disconnect that before accessing the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.690 
disconnect that before accessing the
brake<00:04:15.810> light<00:04:16.019> switch

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
okay in order to get a little bit better

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.780 
okay in order to get a little bit better
access<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.360> brake<00:04:25.080> light<00:04:25.350> switch<00:04:25.790> what

right here what this duct does is just

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.680 
right here what this duct does is just
take<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.530> air<00:04:32.400> from<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.880> AC<00:04:33.090> over<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.140> the

take the air from the AC over to the
driver<00:04:36.690> side<00:04:37.110> vent<00:04:37.920> here<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.750> should<00:04:40.110> be

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
driver side vent here so that should be

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.430 
driver side vent here so that should be
easy<00:04:40.470> enough<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.830> remove<00:04:41.900> there<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:43.170> just<00:04:45.440> one

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
easy enough to remove there is just one
