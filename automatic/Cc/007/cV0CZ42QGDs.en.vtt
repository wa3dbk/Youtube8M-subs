language<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.120> still<00:00:53.420> it's<00:00:53.660> also<00:00:53.899> good<00:00:54.260> if

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
language but still it's also good if

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.020 
language but still it's also good if
you're<00:00:54.559> capable<00:00:54.770> of<00:00:55.250> just<00:00:55.460> creating<00:00:55.699> your<00:00:55.969> own

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
wasn't too hard if someone was in this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.700 
wasn't too hard if someone was in this
area<00:02:23.359> you<00:02:23.419> could<00:02:23.570> call<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:24.049> a<00:02:24.230> tractor

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
area you could call it like a tractor

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.350 
area you could call it like a tractor
white<00:02:24.890> because<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.550> plain<00:02:25.820> white<00:02:26.060> wall

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
white because it's a plain white wall

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360 
white because it's a plain white wall
right<00:02:26.600> here<00:02:26.680> again<00:02:27.680> I'm<00:02:27.740> not<00:02:27.890> really<00:02:27.980> sure<00:02:28.100> why

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
right here again I'm not really sure why

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.950 
right here again I'm not really sure why
someone<00:02:28.730> would<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.120> be<00:02:29.270> sitting<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:29.780> but

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
someone would just be sitting here but

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.510 
someone would just be sitting here but
you<00:02:30.110> never<00:02:30.290> know<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.650> could<00:02:30.680> be<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> spawn<00:02:31.250> trap

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
you never know it could be a spawn trap

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.940 
you never know it could be a spawn trap
later<00:02:31.730> on<00:02:31.910> we'll<00:02:32.120> see<00:02:32.300> how<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.480> goes<00:02:32.650> mid<00:02:33.650> tank

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
later on we'll see how it goes mid tank

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.610 
later on we'll see how it goes mid tank
this<00:02:34.220> would<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.690> let's<00:02:35.690> see<00:02:35.870> statue<00:02:36.290> right

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
this would be let's see statue right

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.440 
this would be let's see statue right
here<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.010> would<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.460> reason<00:02:37.580> why<00:02:37.910> these

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
here this would be the reason why these

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.120 
here this would be the reason why these
have<00:02:38.840> call-outs<00:02:39.350> even<00:02:39.650> though<00:02:39.740> they're<00:02:39.890> so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
have call-outs even though they're so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.010 
have call-outs even though they're so
close<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.670> each<00:02:40.700> other<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.180> because<00:02:41.780> they're

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
close to each other is because they're

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.470 
close to each other is because they're
both<00:02:42.170> they're<00:02:42.530> both<00:02:42.560> pretty<00:02:43.370> much<00:02:43.640> points<00:02:44.300> of

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
both they're both pretty much points of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.510 
both they're both pretty much points of
points<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.050> interests<00:02:45.470> or<00:02:45.560> power<00:02:45.770> positions<00:02:46.370> i

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
points of interests or power positions i

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.100 
points of interests or power positions i
mean<00:02:46.640> i<00:02:46.670> do<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.210> lot<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.420> people<00:02:47.600> at<00:02:47.840> tank
