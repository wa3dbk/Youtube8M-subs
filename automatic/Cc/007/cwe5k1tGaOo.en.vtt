00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.639
 and that he grazed after a 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.090
 week I go back up double as you see 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.770
 this clichÃ© consists of this character is 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.720
 a book with the weapon of 20 to be equal 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.880
 and new ones because you are explaining 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.890
 all the time although I saw it from the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.040
 This person's staff looks normal 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 but it is wrapped screen is believed well 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.399
 and well I do not think it happens again it's not 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.590
 100% sure it will not happen again but 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.149
 that can not always happen but good 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.239
 Now I will explain how the only way 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.219
 to remove it is because otherwise we can not 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.940
 do nothing and as you see it explains 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.250
 you keep pressing the shoot button and 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.079
 to pull the tomahawk because I need 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.600
 higher an edited have to carry 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.460
 taken that is legal 23 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.040
 and it keeps us expelled from the taken 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.009
 well to shoot at the same time and very 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.950
 quickly the dadis to the triangle and 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.110
 explain all that very quickly what of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.970
 keep it ok yes but but when 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.470
 have that triangle and explain you have 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.080
 to do the graphics so that you 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.869
 do and you stay like this the doll doing 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.360
 the action of stripping though this is 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.190
 still is from a good ship serves to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.750
 trolling in overturning and destroying more than 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.880
 nothing because you see on the screens 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920
 when an ally dies you can see 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.590
 your screen and see these stays 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.470
 we said persisted how he has done this and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.390
 good to kill is very complicated 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.420
 because the only way to be able 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.860
 take it off is lying on the ground and kill 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.750
 it's quite complicated and you can 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.610
 do each if you can simply knock down 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.470
 the and remove the putt and nothing else 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.140
 but to make a final low like this has 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.590
 that be very good and good I hope you 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.330
 he liked it like this come up 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.330
 the next video for god
