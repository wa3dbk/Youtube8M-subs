00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.560
 athlete 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.549
 but always win, unfortunately, not alone 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.610
 on the other side is also one 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:24.609
 team and believe that we 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.080

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.660
 i will be the best team this 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.960

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.730
 the hall is sold out the words 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.579
 want to comment on team 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.890

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.100
 responsibility within the team 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.550
 and there are no thoughts whatsoever 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.090
 tomorrow what will happen tomorrow 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.109
 now 21 22 then we go on charred 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.809
 one should not just say big words 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.489
 and sophistication airport very conscious 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.310
 and as far as an argument in the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.640
 cards plays know how to 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.570
 We have to be able to play against Basel 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.580
 happy that we appreciate the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 have opportunity to play and play 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.400
 and we a player and for one 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.870
 Verein is not beautiful by law 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.830
 it is that it also shows the resonance 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.240
 the people played here but what you what 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.400
 you definitely on the extended 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.720
 the experience that one has made 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.120
 you do not forget the experience of the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.660
 the team this year 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.570
 made me optimistic that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.400
 she at least knows what 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.170
 and what we do that we have a situation we 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 are that they know exactly that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.760
 tomorrow in front of the house like a super 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
 chance to balance the series and 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.790
 I would like to play 5 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.790
