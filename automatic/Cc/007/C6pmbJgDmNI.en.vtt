00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.620
 both the movement of our body 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.060
 as the tone of voice is more important than 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.650
 what we believe in relation to our 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.080
 animals the dogs are big 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 observers in fact spend almost all the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.840
 day 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.420
 watching us studying our 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.119
 movements we like to believe that our 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.520
 animals understand us but it's not like that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.710
 they associate a sound and a tone of voice 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.360
 to a specific order that's why 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.760
 example for many years 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.470
 used English and German because 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.470
 they usually use very short words 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.860
 down 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.860
 down 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 a very common mistake is to repeat 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.800
 constantly the name of our 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.269
 dog to call him if we want 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.789
 that our dog comes to our 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.589
 call we will have to make your name already 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.589
 then come here 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 and there we are giving you information 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.039
 if not what we do is try to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.649
 get attention but after a 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.020
 time disconnects is as if for example 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.509
 a child constantly told us mom 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.159
 mum mom without specifying us what is it 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.770
 what he wants from us is the same 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.689
 effect that it creates on animals for a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 dog a cheerful tone of voice and without shouting 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.060
 It is both reward and encouragement 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.409
 here 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.130
 7 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.130
 Cyrus 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.870
 yes no camps camps 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.700
 it's not good to scream dogs first 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.400
 because dogs have a capacity 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.950
 auditory much larger than the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.690
 our what can cause them fear 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.500
 and in no case will you give them any 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.500
 useful training 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 apart 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.020
 we tend to forget a factor that is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.720
 obvious the scale of the animal with respect 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.240
 we are giants for them in 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.240
 special for races minutes 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.700
 ideally we could crouch be at 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.310
 the height of the animal and calmly 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.310
 call him I want to be a fan 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.370
 5 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.379
 I come to publish 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.690
 we should not get close to our dog 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.380
 with sudden movements or pounce 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.940
 give us about him 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.940
 body language is also 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.350
 important at the time of training 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.630
 we will have to try that our 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.660
 body is as upright as possible 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.700
 obviously without looking like robots 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 but that we are a clear position for 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.380
 our animal and the orders of the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.380
 gestures should be very very clear 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.690
 action
