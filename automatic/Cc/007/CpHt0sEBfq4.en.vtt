put it in the tank and you see that

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.320 
put it in the tank and you see that
detritus<00:00:23.850> being<00:00:24.210> kicked<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.600> there<00:00:26.060> that<00:00:27.060> was

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
detritus being kicked up there that was

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.189 
detritus being kicked up there that was
kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.140> dead<00:00:28.380> spot<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:28.980> tank<00:00:29.720> which<00:00:30.720> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
kind of a dead spot in my tank which you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.510 
kind of a dead spot in my tank which you
know<00:00:31.320> stuff<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.769> collecting<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.279> there

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
know stuff was collecting over there

give you a top view of what I'm talking

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.790 
give you a top view of what I'm talking
about<00:00:36.110> trying<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.350> where<00:00:37.530> stuff<00:00:37.770> was

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
about trying to see where stuff was

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
about trying to see where stuff was
collecting<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:40.280> now<00:00:41.780> it's<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
collecting back there now it's not this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860 
collecting back there now it's not this
is<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> knock<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> mp40<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.329> mp40

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is not a knock on the mp40 the mp40

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.260 
is not a knock on the mp40 the mp40
definitely<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:47.160> blasting<00:00:47.910> well<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
definitely was blasting well you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.100 
definitely was blasting well you
can<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:49.610> it's<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.480> centered<00:00:51.960> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
can see how it's kind of not centered I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720 
can see how it's kind of not centered I
did<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.649> purpose<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.370> didn't

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
did that on purpose because I didn't

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660 
did that on purpose because I didn't
want<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> water<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.710> blast<00:00:55.710> off<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.399> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
want the water to blast off of this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
want the water to blast off of this
overflow<00:00:58.399> over<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
overflow over here and kind of do a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.549 
overflow over here and kind of do a
whirlwind<00:01:01.969> back<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> probably

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
whirlwind back here which is probably

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
whirlwind back here which is probably
what<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.280> done<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> I'm

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
what I should have done now that I'm

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.050 
what I should have done now that I'm
thinking<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:06.810> anyways<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.000> kind<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
thinking about it but anyways I kind of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640 
thinking about it but anyways I kind of
wanted<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> flow<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.960> straight<00:01:10.320> through

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
wanted the flow to go straight through

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.219 
wanted the flow to go straight through
for<00:01:11.040> wave<00:01:11.250> making<00:01:11.520> purposes<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
for wave making purposes so you know the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.450 
for wave making purposes so you know the
water<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
water can you make it all the way to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.039 
water can you make it all the way to
this<00:01:14.640> side<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.150> back<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> other<00:01:16.530> mp10

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
this side and back with the other mp10

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
this side and back with the other mp10
so<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> bought<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.979> pump<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.450> like

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so I kind of bought this pump to be like

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.899 
so I kind of bought this pump to be like
a<00:01:21.750> backup<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.950> put<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> try<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
a backup and I put it in there to try it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.569 
a backup and I put it in there to try it
and<00:01:26.390> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> man<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.220> mean<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> minute

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and kind of like it man I mean a minute

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
and kind of like it man I mean a minute
I<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.240> turned<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.659> its<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
I put it in and turned it on its on the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.100 
I put it in and turned it on its on the
lowest<00:01:31.470> setting<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.360> kicked<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.869> all

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
lowest setting and it just kicked up all

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.770 
lowest setting and it just kicked up all
of<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> detritus<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:36.270> getting<00:01:36.420> pushed

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of that detritus and it's getting pushed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.280 
of that detritus and it's getting pushed
into<00:01:36.960> my<00:01:37.170> overflow<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> far<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
into my overflow so so far I like it I

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.539 
into my overflow so so far I like it I
kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> don't<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> look<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
kind of don't like the look of it in the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.910 
kind of don't like the look of it in the
tank<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.350> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
tank but you know I kind of like the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.630 
tank but you know I kind of like the
cleanness<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> MPS<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:53.610> are

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
cleanness of the MPS see how they are

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.030 
cleanness of the MPS see how they are
see<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> coraline<00:01:55.079> algae<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.649> crazy<00:01:55.920> on

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
see the coraline algae going crazy on

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.910 
see the coraline algae going crazy on
that<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:57.799> but<00:01:58.799> um<00:02:00.110> yeah<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> guess<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.770> know
