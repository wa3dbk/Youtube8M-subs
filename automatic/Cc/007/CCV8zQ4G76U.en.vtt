00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
here anyway we're going to do a little

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.450 
here anyway we're going to do a little
bit<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.390> kitchen<00:00:06.810> table<00:00:07.200> wiring<00:00:07.950> project

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
bit of kitchen table wiring project

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.669 
bit of kitchen table wiring project
today<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.120> got<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.660> little<00:00:09.929> project<00:00:10.110> going<00:00:10.559> on

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
today we got a little project going on

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.640 
today we got a little project going on
we're<00:00:11.490> making<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:11.940> jumper<00:00:12.300> cables<00:00:12.500> we<00:00:13.500> got

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
we're making some jumper cables we got

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
we're making some jumper cables we got
five<00:00:13.889> black<00:00:14.190> 5<00:00:14.519> red<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.500> we<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.710> 18<00:00:17.220> inches

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
five black 5 red and we have 18 inches

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.740 
five black 5 red and we have 18 inches
of<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:21.260> 14<00:00:22.260> gauge<00:00:22.439> wire<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.730> don't<00:00:24.660> know

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
of a 14 gauge wire I think I don't know

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
of a 14 gauge wire I think I don't know
anyway<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.609> we're

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
anyway what we're going to do is we're

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.109 
anyway what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> strip<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.630> each<00:00:27.930> end<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.830> 1/2<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
going to strip off each end about 1/2 to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.930 
going to strip off each end about 1/2 to
3/4<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.929> an<00:00:31.050> inch<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.160> got<00:00:32.369> enough<00:00:32.730> bare

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
3/4 of an inch so we got enough bare

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
3/4 of an inch so we got enough bare
wire<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.040> then<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> feed<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> up

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
wire and then we're going to feed it up

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.520 
wire and then we're going to feed it up
through<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.610> end<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.239> thing<00:00:39.570> through<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
through the end of this thing through a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.549 
through the end of this thing through a
little<00:00:40.920> loop<00:00:41.480> de<00:00:42.480> loop<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.379> see

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
little loop de loop you can kind of see

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.000 
little loop de loop you can kind of see
it<00:00:43.649> there<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> come<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.300> again<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
it there and have it come out again and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
it there and have it come out again and
then<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.219> tightened<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> screw<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
then get tightened down at the screw and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.139 
then get tightened down at the screw and
then<00:00:49.200> we'll<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.620> end<00:00:49.980> done<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> if

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
then we'll have one end done and if

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
then we'll have one end done and if
we're<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.600> lucky<00:00:51.809> we'll<00:00:52.500> remember<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
we're really lucky we'll remember to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.000 
we're really lucky we'll remember to
keep<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> wiring<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> let's<00:00:55.860> get

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
keep these on the wiring so let's get

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.939 
keep these on the wiring so let's get
started<00:00:56.430> here<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.530> our

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
started here so now that we have our

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.050 
started here so now that we have our
wire<00:01:02.340> stripped<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.229> inside<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.460> jumper

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
wire stripped and it inside our jumper

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.560 
wire stripped and it inside our jumper
connector<00:01:06.799> we<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.820> we've<00:01:09.090> got<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.420> fit

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
connector we are going we've got to fit

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.000 
connector we are going we've got to fit
it<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.200> loop<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> now

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it through that little loop and now

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770 
it through that little loop and now
we're<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> screw<00:01:12.180> back<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
we're going to put the screw back in and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
we're going to put the screw back in and
see<00:01:12.900> how<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.320> looks<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.920> together<00:01:14.070> on

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
see how it all looks put together on

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.440 
see how it all looks put together on
this<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.060> end<00:01:16.189> we<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.490> everything<00:01:18.090> hooked

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this one end we have everything hooked

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
this one end we have everything hooked
up<00:01:18.750> we've<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.470> wire<00:01:19.680> through<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> little

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
up we've got the wire through the little

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
up we've got the wire through the little
eye<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> screw<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.780> I'll<00:01:24.780> sleeve

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
eye and around the screw and I'll sleeve

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.929 
eye and around the screw and I'll sleeve
put<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> finished

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
put back on you can see the finished

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
put back on you can see the finished
result<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.710> don't<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.920> whether<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
result I don't know whether I'm going to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
result I don't know whether I'm going to
use<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> heat<00:01:30.479> shrink<00:01:30.840> tubing<00:01:31.350> or

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
use some kind of heat shrink tubing or

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219 
use some kind of heat shrink tubing or
just<00:01:31.979> plain<00:01:32.340> old<00:01:32.549> electrical<00:01:33.119> tape<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> seal

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
just plain old electrical tape to seal

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.850 
just plain old electrical tape to seal
that<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> doesn't<00:01:35.189> run<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> risk<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
that so it doesn't run the risk of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.050 
that so it doesn't run the risk of
shorting<00:01:37.860> against<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> ground<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.850> another

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
shorting against the ground or another

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.880 
shorting against the ground or another
source<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.570> power<00:01:41.030> anyway<00:01:42.030> let's<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
source of power anyway let's take this

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.690 
source of power anyway let's take this
sleeve<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.979> kind<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> see<00:01:50.490> how<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sleeve off and you can kind of see how I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550 
sleeve off and you can kind of see how I
did<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.390> I've<00:01:51.570> ran<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.079> through<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
did it here I've ran it up through this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.749 
did it here I've ran it up through this
part<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.460> through<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> opening<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
part here through the opening and

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.670 
part here through the opening and
through<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.000> little<00:01:57.210> through<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.380> pot

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
through that little through this pot

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.190 
through that little through this pot
here<00:01:58.979> through<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> eyelet<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
here through the eyelet and then to the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.330 
here through the eyelet and then to the
opening<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.899> then<00:02:03.899> around<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.500> screw<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
opening and then around that screw in

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.150 
opening and then around that screw in
the<00:02:05.670> direction<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> screw<00:02:06.540> tighten<00:02:07.020> down

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
the direction of the screw tighten down

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.979 
the direction of the screw tighten down
so<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> wire<00:02:08.520> would<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.970> pulled<00:02:09.270> against<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
so the wire would be pulled against the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
so the wire would be pulled against the
screw<00:02:10.349> as<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.310> tightened<00:02:11.790> down<00:02:12.000> now

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
screw as it tightened down now

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900 
screw as it tightened down now
we're<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> move<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> other<00:02:14.640> end

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
we're going to move on to the other end

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.660 
we're going to move on to the other end
which<00:02:15.120> will<00:02:15.300> be<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> red<00:02:15.990> end<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> now<00:02:20.280> we've<00:02:20.490> got

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
which will be a red end so now we've got

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.460 
which will be a red end so now we've got
our<00:02:20.700> red<00:02:21.030> end<00:02:21.270> done<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.070> we<00:02:23.070> cut<00:02:23.340> off<00:02:23.550> about

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
our red end done and we cut off about

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.620 
our red end done and we cut off about
3/4<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.620> an<00:02:25.710> inch<00:02:25.860> worth<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.190> insulation<00:02:26.670> poked

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
3/4 to an inch worth of insulation poked

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.840 
3/4 to an inch worth of insulation poked
it<00:02:27.810> through<00:02:28.080> everything<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:29.400> got<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.640> tight

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
it through everything you got it tight

it through everything you got it tight
around<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.180> screw<00:02:30.450> neatly<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.370> put

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
around the screw neatly and then we put

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.700 
around the screw neatly and then we put
our<00:02:32.610> sleeve<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.510> almost<00:02:33.900> forgot<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.530> put

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
our sleeve on I almost forgot to put

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.590 
our sleeve on I almost forgot to put
sleeve<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.340> wiring<00:02:35.550> buzz<00:02:36.030> offer<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.450> I'd

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
sleeve in the wiring buzz offer it I'd

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.780 
sleeve in the wiring buzz offer it I'd
point<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.990> out<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.190> was<00:02:38.340> making<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
point that out that I was making a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.530 
point that out that I was making a
tremendous<00:02:39.210> mistake<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.830> got<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.540> one

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
tremendous mistake so we got one one

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.540 
tremendous mistake so we got one one
jumper<00:02:42.900> wire<00:02:43.080> done<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.770> not<00:02:43.860> time<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.430> do

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
jumper wire done so it's not time to do

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.840 
jumper wire done so it's not time to do
the<00:02:44.700> other<00:02:44.850> four<00:02:45.210> wish<00:02:45.750> me<00:02:45.960> luck

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the other four wish me luck

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.160 
the other four wish me luck
that's<00:02:47.850> about<00:02:48.120> how<00:02:48.300> much<00:02:48.480> why<00:02:48.720> you're<00:02:48.960> going

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that's about how much why you're going

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.470 
that's about how much why you're going
to<00:02:49.230> need<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.740> through<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.400> doesn't<00:02:50.970> smell

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
to need to go through the doesn't smell

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.690 
to need to go through the doesn't smell
sleeve<00:02:51.990> there<00:02:52.350> through<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> trap<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> then

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
sleeve there through the trap and then

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.110 
sleeve there through the trap and then
up<00:02:53.910> over<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.600> around<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.140> screw<00:02:56.120> that's

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
up over and around the screw that's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.690 
up over and around the screw that's
probably<00:02:57.690> about<00:02:57.840> an<00:02:58.260> inch<00:02:58.650> maybe<00:02:59.010> an<00:02:59.340> inch<00:02:59.520> in

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
probably about an inch maybe an inch in

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
probably about an inch maybe an inch in
eighth<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.210> quarter<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:01.260> you're<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
eighth or a quarter if you're going to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.660 
eighth or a quarter if you're going to
get<00:03:01.770> really<00:03:02.070> down<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.580> nitty<00:03:02.790> gritty

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
get really down to the nitty gritty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.160 
get really down to the nitty gritty
alright<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.330> once<00:03:06.810> we<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.410> have<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:09.170> all

find<00:03:12.390> my<00:03:12.570> electrical<00:03:13.200> tape<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.330> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
find my electrical tape and I'm going to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.470 
find my electrical tape and I'm going to
tape<00:03:15.660> over<00:03:15.930> where<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.770> exposed<00:03:17.160> wire<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.940> down
