here<00:01:49.979> kind<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.460> pause<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> second

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
here kind of like pause for a second

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
here kind of like pause for a second
because<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.960> wasn't<00:01:52.290> expecting<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:53.310> my

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because I wasn't expecting it at all my

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.510 
because I wasn't expecting it at all my
controllers<00:01:54.180> vibrating<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.140> control<00:01:55.560> for

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
controllers vibrating out of control for

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 
controllers vibrating out of control for
some<00:01:56.729> reason<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.210> Moxie<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.500> gun

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
some reason I think Moxie like this gun
for<00:01:59.130> other<00:01:59.399> reasons<00:01:59.700> besides<00:02:00.090> how

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
for other reasons besides how

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.440 
for other reasons besides how
efficiently<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.770> kills<00:02:02.340> enemies<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.119> huh<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
efficiently it kills enemies but huh I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
efficiently it kills enemies but huh I
will<00:02:03.689> leave<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.649> anyways<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.250> hope
