00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.550 

so<00:00:01.979> recall<00:00:02.129> last<00:00:02.730> time<00:00:02.939> we<00:00:03.480> saw<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:04.140> we

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
so recall last time we saw that we

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.740 
so recall last time we saw that we
designed<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.100> controller<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.700> was<00:00:06.359> nice<00:00:06.540> and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
designed a controller that was nice and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.640 
designed a controller that was nice and
smooth<00:00:07.020> didn't<00:00:07.500> overreact<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.429> small<00:00:08.730> errors

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
smooth didn't overreact to small errors

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.890 
smooth didn't overreact to small errors
made<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> system<00:00:10.920> stable<00:00:11.610> yet<00:00:12.240> didn't<00:00:12.750> achieve

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
made a system stable yet didn't achieve

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
made a system stable yet didn't achieve
tracking<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.920> was<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.280> proportional

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
tracking and this was the proportional

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.439 
tracking and this was the proportional
regulator<00:00:15.690> or<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.080> P<00:00:16.260> regulator<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.640> let's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
regulator or the P regulator and let's

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
regulator or the P regulator and let's
return<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.199> our<00:00:19.289> performance<00:00:19.890> objectives<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
return to our performance objectives a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.800 
return to our performance objectives a
little<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:20.880> we've<00:00:21.090> talked<00:00:21.359> about<00:00:21.630> them

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
little bit we've talked about them

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
little bit we've talked about them
briefly<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.189> controller<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
briefly but the controller at the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.560 
briefly but the controller at the
minimum<00:00:24.269> should<00:00:25.099> stabilize<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.460> system<00:00:26.820> if

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
minimum should stabilize the system if

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
minimum should stabilize the system if
it<00:00:27.779> doesn't<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.830> nothing<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it doesn't do that we have nothing and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.880 
it doesn't do that we have nothing and
I've<00:00:29.820> written<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.420> rather<00:00:30.890> awkward-looking

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
I've written this rather awkward-looking

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.610 
I've written this rather awkward-looking
acronym<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.030> Bible<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:33.960> something

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
acronym here Bible which is something

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.319 
acronym here Bible which is something
out<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> Lord<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> Rings<00:00:35.280> almost<00:00:35.820> what

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
out of the Lord of the Rings almost what

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.139 
out of the Lord of the Rings almost what
it<00:00:36.450> stands<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.079> bounded<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.219> bounded<00:00:38.969> out

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
it stands for is bounded in bounded out

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.080 
it stands for is bounded in bounded out
which<00:00:40.110> means<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.340> control<00:00:41.700> signal

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
which means that if the control signal

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
which means that if the control signal
is<00:00:42.149> bounded<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.410> state<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> system

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
is bounded the state of the system

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
is bounded the state of the system
should<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.760> bounded<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.930> means

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
should also be bounded what this means

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.729 
should also be bounded what this means
is<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.980> doing<00:00:48.230> reasonable<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
is that by doing reasonable things the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
is that by doing reasonable things the
system<00:00:49.920> doesn't<00:00:50.340> blow<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.610> an<00:00:50.850> Argus<00:00:51.390> system

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
system doesn't blow up an Argus system

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
system doesn't blow up an Argus system
doesn't<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.140> tracking<00:00:52.949> means<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.340> should

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
doesn't do that tracking means we should

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
doesn't do that tracking means we should
get<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> reference<00:00:54.660> value<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
get to the reference value we want and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.770 
get to the reference value we want and
robustness<00:00:56.309> means<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:57.149> shouldn't<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
robustness means we shouldn't have to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.470 
robustness means we shouldn't have to
know<00:00:57.989> too<00:00:58.680> much<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:59.070> parameters<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.180> we

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
know too much about parameters that we

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.049 
know too much about parameters that we
really<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> no<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> knowing<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
really have no way of knowing and

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.950 
really have no way of knowing and
preferably<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.300> should<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.570> able<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> fight

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
preferably we should be able to fight

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.670 
preferably we should be able to fight
noise<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.180> recall<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.409> was

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
noise as well so recall that this was

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
noise as well so recall that this was
the<00:01:07.830> model<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> introduced<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the model and when I introduced this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
the model and when I introduced this
wind<00:01:10.080> resistance<00:01:10.650> term<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.760> had<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
wind resistance term here we had a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.179 
wind resistance term here we had a
little<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.570> problem<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.619> proportional

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
little bit of a problem the proportional

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
little bit of a problem the proportional
regulator<00:01:14.490> couldn't<00:01:14.880> overcome<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.830> let's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
regulator couldn't overcome it and let's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
regulator couldn't overcome it and let's
have<00:01:17.040> another<00:01:17.310> controller<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
have another controller than one that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.060 
have another controller than one that
explicitly<00:01:20.009> cancels<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> effect<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
explicitly cancels out the effect of the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.880 
explicitly cancels out the effect of the
wind<00:01:23.640> resistance<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.890> attempt

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
wind resistance so here is my attempt

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.359 
wind resistance so here is my attempt
three<00:01:26.210> I'm<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> use<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.439> part<00:01:28.770> which

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
three I'm going to use this part which

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
three I'm going to use this part which
is<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.670> proportional<00:01:30.270> part<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.720> already

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
is the proportional part that we already

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
is the proportional part that we already
talked<00:01:31.259> about<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:32.400> gonna<00:01:32.520> add<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
talked about and then I'm gonna add this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.950 
talked about and then I'm gonna add this
thing<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> plus<00:01:34.530> gamma<00:01:35.340> M<00:01:35.700> over<00:01:36.240> C<00:01:36.509> times

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
thing which is plus gamma M over C times

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.749 
thing which is plus gamma M over C times
X<00:01:38.630> well<00:01:39.630> why<00:01:40.020> did<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.369> did<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
X well why did I do this well I did this

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.050 
X well why did I do this well I did this
for<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> following<00:01:42.450> reason<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:44.060> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
for the following reason that if you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
for the following reason that if you
reach<00:01:45.270> steady<00:01:45.600> state<00:01:45.720> X<00:01:46.320> naught<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.590> equal<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
reach steady state X naught is equal to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.999 
reach steady state X naught is equal to
zero<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:49.860> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
zero then now what you get is well this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.010 
zero then now what you get is well this
was<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> P<00:01:50.460> part<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> controller

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
was the P part this is the controller

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
was the P part this is the controller
the<00:01:52.259> P<00:01:52.409> controller<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> effect<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the P controller and then the effect of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
the P controller and then the effect of
this<00:01:54.540> thing<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> multiply

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this thing when you're going to multiply

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
this thing when you're going to multiply
this<00:01:56.549> by<00:01:56.729> C<00:01:57.329> over<00:01:57.570> m<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:58.590> you're<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
this by C over m what you're going to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
this by C over m what you're going to
get<00:01:59.070> then<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.310> plus<00:01:59.790> gamma<00:02:00.270> X<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
get then is plus gamma X and then you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.399 
get then is plus gamma X and then you
have<00:02:01.380> wind<00:02:01.590> resistance<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:03.409> negative

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
have wind resistance which is negative

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.219 
have wind resistance which is negative
gamma<00:02:04.740> X<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.729> gamma<00:02:05.939> X<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.630> bad<00:02:06.810> parts

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
gamma X so the gamma X the bad parts

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.889 
gamma X so the gamma X the bad parts
cancel<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.729> fact<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.149> we're<00:02:09.720> left

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
cancel out and in fact all we're left

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.980 
cancel out and in fact all we're left
with<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.920> X<00:02:11.459> has<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.720> be

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
with then is that X has to be

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.310 
with then is that X has to be
equal<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.320> our<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.460> voila<00:02:14.850> we've<00:02:15.690> solved<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
equal to our so voila we've solved the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.430 
equal to our so voila we've solved the
problem<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:18.600> have<00:02:18.840> perfect<00:02:19.830> tracking<00:02:21.230> or<00:02:22.230> have

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
problem we have perfect tracking or have

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.360 
problem we have perfect tracking or have
we<00:02:22.620> don't<00:02:23.460> don't<00:02:23.850> don't<00:02:24.350> no<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.770> not<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
we don't don't don't no we have not and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.010 
we don't don't don't no we have not and
why<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.850> well<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.480> stability

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
why is this well we have stability

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.780 
why is this well we have stability
we<00:02:28.170> are<00:02:28.260> tracking<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.250> don't<00:02:29.550> have

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
we are tracking but we don't have

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.590 
we are tracking but we don't have
robustness<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.410> three<00:02:32.370> things<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.480> we

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
robustness here are three things that we

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.960 
robustness here are three things that we
don't<00:02:33.810> know<00:02:34.170> gamma<00:02:34.740> m<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.370> C<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.850> our

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
don't know gamma m and C and our

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.260 
don't know gamma m and C and our
controller<00:02:36.440> depends<00:02:37.580> explicitly<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.820> on

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
controller depends explicitly of on

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.960 
controller depends explicitly of on
these<00:02:39.870> coefficients<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.190> all<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.520> sudden<00:02:41.880> we

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
these coefficients so all of a sudden we

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.010 
these coefficients so all of a sudden we
have<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> know<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.540> these<00:02:42.660> physical

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
have to know all these physical

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.440 
have to know all these physical
parameters<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.390> is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
parameters that we don't know so this is

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.730 
parameters that we don't know so this is
not<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.110> robust<00:02:46.680> control<00:02:47.250> design<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> attempt

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
not a robust control design so attempt

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.720 
not a robust control design so attempt
three<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> failure<00:02:51.890> okay<00:02:52.890> let's<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.430> back<00:02:53.580> to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
three is a failure okay let's go back to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.130 
three is a failure okay let's go back to
the<00:02:53.820> P<00:02:53.970> regulator<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.630> what's<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:55.080> on

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the P regulator and see what's going on

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
the P regulator and see what's going on
there<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.530> what's<00:02:55.770> actually<00:02:56.160> happening<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
there what what's actually happening is

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.720 
there what what's actually happening is
that<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.840> proportional<00:02:58.500> error<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:59.100> doing<00:02:59.670> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that the proportional error is doing a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.350 
that the proportional error is doing a
fine<00:03:00.030> job<00:03:00.140> pushing<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:02.100> system<00:03:02.580> up<00:03:02.730> too<00:03:03.120> close

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
fine job pushing the system up too close

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.290 
fine job pushing the system up too close
to<00:03:03.960> where<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> should<00:03:04.440> be<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.460> it<00:03:06.000> kind

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
to where it should be but then it kind

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.390 
to where it should be but then it kind
of<00:03:06.360> runs<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.930> steam<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.770> can't<00:03:08.010> push

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
of runs out of steam and it can't push

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.640 
of runs out of steam and it can't push
hard<00:03:09.150> enough<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.690> overcome<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:12.440> effect<00:03:13.440> of

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
hard enough to overcome the effect of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.190 
hard enough to overcome the effect of
the<00:03:13.770> wind<00:03:13.890> resistance<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.450> proportional

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the wind resistance so the proportional

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.830 
the wind resistance so the proportional
thing<00:03:16.440> isn't<00:03:16.890> hard<00:03:17.250> enough<00:03:17.580> but<00:03:18.210> take<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> look

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
thing isn't hard enough but take a look

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.920 
thing isn't hard enough but take a look
here<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:19.590> have<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.270> error<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.750> then

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
here we have this is the error and then

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.810 
here we have this is the error and then
the<00:03:22.080> error<00:03:22.230> starts<00:03:22.770> accumulating<00:03:23.130> over<00:03:23.610> time

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
the error starts accumulating over time

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.750 
the error starts accumulating over time
so<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.750> somehow<00:03:25.110> if<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.220> were<00:03:26.340> able<00:03:26.520> to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
so if we somehow if we were able to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.810 
so if we somehow if we were able to
collect<00:03:27.570> all<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.620> these<00:03:28.770> errors<00:03:29.070> over<00:03:29.400> time

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
collect all of these errors over time

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.910 
collect all of these errors over time
even<00:03:30.810> though<00:03:30.930> there<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.290> small<00:03:31.470> over<00:03:31.710> time

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
even though there is small over time

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.610 
even though there is small over time
that<00:03:32.070> should<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.280> enough<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.380> use

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that should be enough so that we can use

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.220 
that should be enough so that we can use
this<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.190> accumulated<00:03:36.090> error<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.720> push<00:03:36.960> all

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
this now accumulated error to push all

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.130 
this now accumulated error to push all
the<00:03:37.500> way<00:03:37.530> up<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:38.880> wish<00:03:39.180> there<00:03:39.450> was<00:03:39.540> some<00:03:39.900> way

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the way up so I wish there was some way

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.760 
the way up so I wish there was some way
of<00:03:40.910> collecting<00:03:41.910> things<00:03:42.240> over<00:03:43.020> time<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.590> plot

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
of collecting things over time in a plot

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.580 
of collecting things over time in a plot
like<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:45.120> course<00:03:45.180> there<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.350> this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
like this and of course there is is this

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650 
like this and of course there is is this
something<00:03:46.980> called<00:03:47.160> an<00:03:47.310> integral<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.390> we

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
something called an integral so if we

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.260 
something called an integral so if we
take<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.020> integral<00:03:49.260> over<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.400> error<00:03:50.580> we're

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
take the integral over the error we're

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.930 
take the integral over the error we're
collecting<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.080> error<00:03:52.350> over<00:03:52.950> time<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.670> over

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
collecting the error over time and over

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.700 
collecting the error over time and over
time<00:03:53.970> as<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:55.080> error<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.620> to

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
time as this error is going to

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.710 
time as this error is going to
accumulate<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.460> to<00:03:56.520> give<00:03:56.670> us<00:03:56.720> enough

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
accumulate it's going to give us enough

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.040 
accumulate it's going to give us enough
pushing<00:03:58.650> power<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.490> actually<00:03:59.910> overcome<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
pushing power to actually overcome the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.870 
pushing power to actually overcome the
wind<00:04:01.230> resistance<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.890> attempt<00:04:02.340> four<00:04:02.580> is<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.770> p.i

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
wind resistance so attempt four is a p.i

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.330 
wind resistance so attempt four is a p.i
regulator<00:04:06.050> so<00:04:07.050> what<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> have<00:04:07.440> here<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.860> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
regulator so what I have here is the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.140 
regulator so what I have here is the
error<00:04:08.520> at<00:04:08.910> time<00:04:09.180> T<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.290> my<00:04:10.800> KP<00:04:11.700> which<00:04:12.000> is

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
error at time T this is my KP which is

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.270 
error at time T this is my KP which is
my<00:04:12.330> proportional<00:04:13.260> gain<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.070> P

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
my proportional gain so this is the P

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.699 
my proportional gain so this is the P
part<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.000> already<00:04:15.150> saw<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:16.230> now<00:04:16.470> I'm

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
part that we already saw and now I'm

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.849 
part that we already saw and now I'm
adding<00:04:16.980> an<00:04:17.370> integral<00:04:18.330> that<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:19.049> integrating

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
adding an integral that is integrating

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.120 
adding an integral that is integrating
up<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.400> error<00:04:20.609> from<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.239> beginning<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.770> the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
up the error from the beginning to the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130 
up the error from the beginning to the
current<00:04:23.520> time<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.030> it's<00:04:24.479> collecting<00:04:24.960> this

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
current time and it's collecting this

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.790 
current time and it's collecting this
and<00:04:25.410> then<00:04:25.530> we

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
and then we

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.939 
and then we
another<00:04:26.069> term<00:04:26.370> here<00:04:26.400> or<00:04:26.819> another<00:04:27.090> coefficient

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
another term here or another coefficient

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.399 
another term here or another coefficient
the<00:04:28.949> K<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.400> where<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.000> stands<00:04:30.479> for<00:04:30.629> the<00:04:30.810> integral

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
the K I where I stands for the integral

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.450 
the K I where I stands for the integral
part<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.759> is<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> P<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.750> regulator<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.009> it

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
part so this is a P I regulator and it

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.140 
part so this is a P I regulator and it
is<00:04:35.870> two-thirds<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:38.460> most<00:04:38.669> common

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
is two-thirds of the most common

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.360 
is two-thirds of the most common
regulator<00:04:39.569> found<00:04:39.960> anywhere<00:04:40.919> in<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.190> world

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
regulator found anywhere in the world

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.550 
regulator found anywhere in the world
and<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.610> fact<00:04:41.639> it's<00:04:41.970> almost<00:04:42.419> two-thirds<00:04:43.229> of

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
and in fact it's almost two-thirds of

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.610 
and in fact it's almost two-thirds of
commercial<00:04:44.310> grade<00:04:44.520> cruise<00:04:44.819> controllers<00:04:45.620> so

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
commercial grade cruise controllers so

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.980 
commercial grade cruise controllers so
if<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.949> have<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.129> P<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.699> an<00:04:47.849> i<00:04:48.000> what<00:04:48.629> could

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
if I have a P and an i what could

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.740 
if I have a P and an i what could
possibly<00:04:49.440> be<00:04:49.530> missing<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.069> get<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.550> all<00:04:51.419> of

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
possibly be missing to get to all of

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.980 
possibly be missing to get to all of
them<00:04:52.460> 3/3<00:04:53.460> instead<00:04:53.819> of<00:04:53.879> just<00:04:53.970> two-thirds<00:04:54.659> well

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
them 3/3 instead of just two-thirds well

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.379 
them 3/3 instead of just two-thirds well
we<00:04:55.680> take<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.919> derivative<00:04:56.129> right<00:04:57.030> we<00:04:57.240> have

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
we take a derivative right we have

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.390 
we take a derivative right we have
proportion<00:04:58.379> we<00:04:58.530> have<00:04:58.650> integral<00:04:59.069> and<00:04:59.219> we<00:04:59.280> have

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
proportion we have integral and we have

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.969 
proportion we have integral and we have
a<00:04:59.430> derivative<00:04:59.699> so<00:05:00.270> why<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:01.110> produce<00:05:01.740> what's

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
a derivative so why not produce what's

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.909 
a derivative so why not produce what's
called<00:05:02.159> a<00:05:02.250> PID<00:05:02.819> regulator<00:05:03.539> so<00:05:04.530> now<00:05:04.650> we<00:05:04.710> have<00:05:04.889> a

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
called a PID regulator so now we have a

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.980 
called a PID regulator so now we have a
proportional<00:05:05.550> term<00:05:05.729> with<00:05:06.479> a<00:05:06.509> proportional

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
proportional term with a proportional

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.290 
proportional term with a proportional
again<00:05:07.259> we<00:05:07.919> have<00:05:08.009> an<00:05:08.099> integral<00:05:08.520> part<00:05:08.789> with<00:05:09.210> an

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
again we have an integral part with an

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.140 
again we have an integral part with an
integral<00:05:09.659> D<00:05:09.960> gain<00:05:10.259> and<00:05:10.590> then<00:05:11.310> we<00:05:11.610> have<00:05:11.819> a

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
integral D gain and then we have a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.140 
integral D gain and then we have a
derivative<00:05:12.780> part<00:05:13.409> with<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.280> derivative<00:05:14.909> game

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
derivative part with the derivative game

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.930 
derivative part with the derivative game
so<00:05:15.870> this<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.530> an<00:05:17.479> extremely<00:05:18.479> useful

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
so this is an extremely useful

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.189 
so this is an extremely useful
controller<00:05:20.940> that<00:05:21.180> shows<00:05:21.389> up<00:05:21.569> a<00:05:21.690> lot<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.139> in

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
controller that shows up a lot and in

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.709 
controller that shows up a lot and in
fact<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.770> am<00:05:23.219> going<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.550> hand<00:05:23.759> have<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.240> hand<00:05:24.569> out

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
fact I am going to hand have to hand out

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.230 
fact I am going to hand have to hand out
a<00:05:25.020> big<00:05:25.590> sweetheart<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.580> PID<00:05:26.909> regulator

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
a big sweetheart to the PID regulator

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.010 
a big sweetheart to the PID regulator
because<00:05:27.780> it's<00:05:28.259> such<00:05:28.590> an<00:05:28.830> important<00:05:29.460> type<00:05:29.789> of

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
because it's such an important type of

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.930 
because it's such an important type of
control<00:05:31.020> structure<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.650> shows<00:05:31.860> up<00:05:32.069> all<00:05:32.520> the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
control structure that shows up all the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.450 
control structure that shows up all the
time<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.479> in<00:05:34.349> fact<00:05:34.560> we're<00:05:34.860> gonna<00:05:34.949> get<00:05:35.159> quite

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
time and in fact we're gonna get quite

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.050 
time and in fact we're gonna get quite
good<00:05:35.490> at<00:05:36.090> designing<00:05:36.990> PID<00:05:37.500> regulators<00:05:38.430> now

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
good at designing PID regulators now

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.510 
good at designing PID regulators now
having<00:05:39.630> said<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:40.259> can<00:05:40.889> draw<00:05:41.039> hearts<00:05:41.190> all<00:05:41.490> I

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
having said that I can draw hearts all I

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.040 
having said that I can draw hearts all I

want let's see it in action and see what

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.379 
want let's see it in action and see what
it<00:05:43.139> actually<00:05:43.169> does<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.860> if<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.520> used<00:05:44.759> just<00:05:45.029> the

it actually does and if I used just the

it actually does and if I used just the

the cruise controller then all of a
sudden<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.639> get<00:05:51.150> something<00:05:51.419> that's<00:05:52.169> getting<00:05:52.529> up

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
sudden I get something that's getting up

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.050 
sudden I get something that's getting up
quickly<00:05:52.860> nice<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.610> slowly

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
quickly nice and slowly

I've<00:05:54.389> been<00:05:54.629> smoothly<00:05:54.930> 270<00:05:55.819> miles<00:05:56.819> per<00:05:57.090> hour

which<00:05:57.539> is<00:05:57.690> my<00:05:57.840> reference<00:05:58.289> so<00:05:58.529> this<00:05:58.770> solves<00:05:59.610> the

which is my reference so this solves the

I<00:06:00.509> don't<00:06:00.960> know<00:06:01.139> parameters<00:06:01.770> so<00:06:02.490> it's<00:06:02.669> robust

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
I don't know parameters so it's robust

I'm achieving tracking because I'm
getting<00:06:05.129> 230<00:06:05.580> miles<00:06:05.759> per<00:06:05.969> hour<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.360> I'm

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
getting 230 miles per hour and I'm

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.559 
getting 230 miles per hour and I'm
stable<00:06:07.860> in<00:06:08.069> the<00:06:08.159> sense<00:06:08.400> that<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.940> didn't<00:06:09.360> crash

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
stable in the sense that I didn't crash

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:16.610 
stable in the sense that I didn't crash
so<00:06:10.169> this<00:06:10.500> seemed<00:06:11.370> like<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.759> very<00:06:12.659> useful<00:06:13.610> design
