00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.650
 we tested the subject that concerns us what 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.350
 put up here in the title of the video 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.109
 let's talk about pokemon I'm not going to 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.990

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.910
 most powerful pokemons or the most geeks 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.429
 Today I'm going to tell you the pokemon that are 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.509
 more absurdly unnatural of the 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.509
 pokemon universe 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.060
 before expressing that I do that you top 5 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.120
 of the most unnatural pokemon and has 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.260
 cost one egg and part of the other 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 organize it in some way since there was 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.140
 so many that it has been quite complicated 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.520
 add them to the list so out of 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.280
 this top have stayed big 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.480
 champions like light we camps have left 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.700
 no clan xing linkedin xing war iii 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.650
 conqueridor and you will be asking if 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.530
 all these have been out of all 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 which ones are the most unnatural according to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.240
 vito, let's go there in the fifth position 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.070
 we have twitch that as you can 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.130
 observe is not more than a damn 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.740
 garbage bag is supposed to be 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.960
 Pokémon are natural creatures and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.119
 objects that we use daily 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.830
 tend to imitate nature not to 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.470
 backwards I can not believe that because 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.600
 let's put trash in a bag of 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.050
 plastic we have it with a loop this 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.090
 magically become a pokémon 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.520
 I do not allow it and we no longer have your 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.190
 evolution that all those evolution 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.150
 is that the garbage did not hold in the bag 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.880
 and it broke 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.300
 it's a pokémon garbage bag round what 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.490
 shit is this I was thinking that 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.909
 implies that we are thinking about fourth 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.049
 position we have to soon 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.079
 I do not know if you can appreciate how it looks 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.060
 that metallic psychic type flyer in 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.219
 attack is powerful but it is only a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.049
 fucking corkscrew equal many of 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.850
 you do not know him I will try to search 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.640
 an image of the corkscrew that I'm 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.610
 saying but it's a fucking corkscrew 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.530
 wine photos wine corkscrew 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.390
 I imagine the situation I have to do 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.549
 a pokémon type met antich or psychic 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.530
 What do I do cork pussy bottle 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.840
 came for pussy corkscrew spiral and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 I have a pokémon in third position or 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 we have to feel with this 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 pokemon see him call pokemon by 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.129
 call them a thing because it is a whore 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.319
 sword is another sword be a little 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.019
 sword is a sword why point that 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.030
 my sword that we're playing is , 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.519
 you could have created any being 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.590
 any creature that with his fight that 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.329
 in his body resemble a sword but 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.250
 not to be a sword that is not just a 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.769
 sword and you can be country a sword not 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.410
 it is a scabbard sword or not the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.440
 experienced will not be like that but when 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.000
 he enters combat he self draws is 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.550
 a pokémon that is a wish 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.010
 I was very much with this pokemon asking him 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.750
 attack I take him by the neck and crushed him 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.020
 to rival him but it is not allowed 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.750
 is an absurd pokémon and its evolution is not 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.870
 is short do not play or what is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.020
 equal double sword is the same shit of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.209
 before but cloned is to say if the shit 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.700
 it's bullshit this is doubly fucking 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.920
 all because it is absurd is absolution 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.690
 this pokemon this pokemon I give it to me 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.850
 ki-moon champa who stabs the rival and 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
 take for ass is front I do not understand no 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.739
 no no no no no do not give me the head look that 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.060
 I'm imaginative but I do not know what can 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.890
 happen I think they are not the same as 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.209
 with the corkscrew had the uncle of 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.910
 sword of the case and said you're going to be 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.690
 a pokémon for my balls in the number 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.020
 two 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.260
 We custom fluency 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.910
 it's about premonition that is a 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.459
 word game with the word key 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.180
 in French or is it an octopus that mounts 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.640
 a fucking pokemon but what the fuck is this 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.010
 ok according to the pocket is the pokemon is 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.390
 only what's above condemned and likes 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.450
 collect chaves 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.240
 he keeps the city ​​gives me a point 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.920
 because a lot but I do not understand it no no 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.470
 No matter how much I see it, I can not find it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.450
 logic could have been a thousand ways 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.700
 you can have created a pokemon point a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.319
 humanoid pokemon point humanoid what 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.910
 happens with the sliced ​​humanoid forms 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.859
 collado that expressed the created a point 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.959
 humanoid pokemon that you like 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.690
 connecting keys is well worth it could 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.270
 get to admit but pokemon keychain 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.130
 for their ring they have keys too 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.470
 to fill the car and on the other side the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.350
 garage from home I suppose to be angry 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.690
 to scare the rival is stirred to remove 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.300
 the keys hit the opponent is scared 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.890
 because he says toño already hits me to see if 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.169
 one of those more keys where he keeps 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:45.010
 the salvation payment of the shipment already arrived 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.260
 to the personalized decadence of pokemon 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.610
 I think that until now, 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.830
 I would be asking after what 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.180
 we have seen whistles in that it can be worse 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.280
 that the previous one that you have put in the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.140
 number one well they grabbed the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.810
 gayumbos and that's what I'm talking about 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.640
 broken right now this law feeling 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.020
 saying but let's hope the above 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.539
 what we have seen 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.879
 It turns out that I'm the bitch in the world 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.190
 pokemon mouse is the housewife of 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.919
 pokemon world because because it changes from 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.020
 I sweat the story that has 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.720
 background but that's kind that it changes from 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.090
 way to a washing machine to a fan to 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.490
 a refrigerator the lawnmower and 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.039
 a fucking oven is that leaves me 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.930
 trembling from the ice I do not care 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.720
 copy the look of what you have at home 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.340
 I sweat that is a legendary pokémon 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.430
 that get the marginal object of 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.800
 way has been complicated to bring the fresh 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.139
 the moment what nintendo said 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.870
 we are going to be a pokémon that through 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.639
 an event you get an object this 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.440
 shape change and nintendo all 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.349
 learning I like the idea of this 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.780
 idea to what forms with which one changes 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.000
 change one since I did not see it 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.659
 I also change the fridge in summer 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.550
 computer 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.440
 if you are hot if you do not have where 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.259
 save the critical state and has is 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.009
 general is a short people short the 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.009
 garden grass 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.490
 because more unnatural 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.190
 leave it in a comment which is your 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.940
 because with more unnatural more than not 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.400
 it can be real from the world to comment the 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.320
 that I said and remember to leave a me 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.960
 like the video if you like this 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.880
 perspective of the shift camera and fans 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.650
 suffered exposed to four bulbs 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.570
 but to the house through the window but then 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.610
 I have to go pick it up so 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.250
 well this is the end of the video and we 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:38.130
 we see in future chapters or earlier if 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.130
 I want I 'm going to some bokeh mont
