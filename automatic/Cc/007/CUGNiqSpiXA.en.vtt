today I want to share a strategy that I
call<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:04.020> morning<00:00:04.470> ritual<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.310> it's

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
call the morning ritual and it's

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.130 
call the morning ritual and it's
something<00:00:06.029> I've<00:00:06.150> used<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.540> help<00:00:06.720> gold<00:00:06.960> from

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
something I've used the help gold from

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.400 
something I've used the help gold from
to<00:00:07.319> 10<00:00:07.620> 22<00:00:08.040> 27<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.059> it's<00:00:09.599> designed<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> help

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
to 10 22 27 and it's designed to help

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.640 
to 10 22 27 and it's designed to help
improve<00:00:10.980> digestion<00:00:11.910> improve<00:00:12.660> absorption<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
improve digestion improve absorption and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.820 
improve digestion improve absorption and
it<00:00:13.980> also<00:00:14.190> helps<00:00:14.700> combat<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.480> acidity<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.350> your

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
it also helps combat the acidity in your

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
it also helps combat the acidity in your
body<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> something<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.690> within

body now this is something I do within

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.560 
body now this is something I do within
five<00:00:19.439> minutes<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.100> waking<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.789> every<00:00:21.330> single

five minutes of waking up every single

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.689 
five minutes of waking up every single
morning<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.410> critical<00:00:22.920> anybody<00:00:23.490> can

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
morning it's that critical anybody can

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.310 
morning it's that critical anybody can
do<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.150> well<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.840> first<00:00:25.109> thing<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
do this as well the first thing to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
do this as well the first thing to
understand<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.189> digestion<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
understand about digestion and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.980 
understand about digestion and
absorption<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.730> cells<00:00:30.660> don't

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
absorption is that your cells don't

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
absorption is that your cells don't
experience<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.830> same<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.669> your

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
experience the same thing that your

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
experience the same thing that your
mouth<00:00:33.030> experiences<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> put

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
mouth experiences just because you put

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
mouth experiences just because you put
food<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.130> mouth<00:00:35.250> doesn't<00:00:36.030> mean<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
food in your mouth doesn't mean and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
food in your mouth doesn't mean and
that's<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.140> actually<00:00:37.800> passes<00:00:38.579> through<00:00:38.850> your

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that's it actually passes through your

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
that's it actually passes through your
digestive<00:00:39.660> tract<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.379> gets<00:00:40.829> into<00:00:41.040> your

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
digestive tract that gets into your

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.290 
digestive tract that gets into your
stomach<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> gets<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.210> blood

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
stomach that it gets into your blood

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
stomach that it gets into your blood
stream<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.350> ultimately<00:00:43.500> gets<00:00:44.070> where

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
stream and that it ultimately gets where

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.850 
stream and that it ultimately gets where
we<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:45.270> muscle<00:00:45.690> cells<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
we want it to your muscle cells so we

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
we want it to your muscle cells so we
have<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.160> look<00:00:47.309> at<00:00:47.430> foods<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> help<00:00:48.180> promote

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
have to look at foods to help promote

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
have to look at foods to help promote
that<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.620> number<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> does

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that and the number one thing that does

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.209 
that and the number one thing that does
that<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.760> fiber<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:52.230> analogy<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.739> give<00:00:53.070> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that is fiber the analogy I can give you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.650 
that is fiber the analogy I can give you
guys<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.059> isn't<00:00:54.360> totally<00:00:54.629> accurate

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
guys is on this isn't totally accurate

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.099 
guys is on this isn't totally accurate
but<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> look<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> long<00:00:56.039> tube<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:57.480> lot<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
but if you look at a long tube a lot of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
but if you look at a long tube a lot of
guys<00:00:58.260> bodybuilders<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.399> problems

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
guys bodybuilders don't have problems

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
guys bodybuilders don't have problems
getting<00:00:59.969> food<00:01:00.539> into<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> tube<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:01.949> have

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
getting food into the tube but they have

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
getting food into the tube but they have
problems<00:01:02.579> getting<00:01:02.820> food<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.960> tube<00:01:04.260> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
problems getting food out of the tube so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640 
problems getting food out of the tube so
we<00:01:05.189> want<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.640> equal<00:01:06.090> flow<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> food<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.290> in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
we want an equal flow of food going in

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
we want an equal flow of food going in
and<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> same<00:01:09.150> rate<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.720> as

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and going out at the same rate now as

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
and going out at the same rate now as
you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.500> imagine<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.460> excreting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you can imagine if you're not excreting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.370 
you can imagine if you're not excreting
your<00:01:12.420> food<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> create<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
your food you're going to create a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
your food you're going to create a
backup<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> prevent

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
backup and that's going to prevent

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
backup and that's going to prevent
digestion<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> absorption<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.220> means

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
digestion and absorption and that means

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.590 
digestion and absorption and that means
you're<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> food

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you're not going to get the food

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.410 
you're not going to get the food
actually<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.680> muscle<00:01:20.100> cells<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.119> one

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
actually into your muscle cells so one

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.810 
actually into your muscle cells so one
strategy<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.140> use<00:01:22.470> every<00:01:22.770> morning<00:01:23.130> upon<00:01:23.400> waking

solution is to bring in the silent
Heroes<00:02:41.130> which<00:02:41.250> i<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> call<00:02:41.880> vegetables

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
Heroes which i like to call vegetables

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.980 
Heroes which i like to call vegetables
and<00:02:43.610> that's<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.880> help<00:02:45.030> neutralize<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
and that's going to help neutralize the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.690 
and that's going to help neutralize the
acidity<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.740> these<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.040> based<00:02:47.310> foods

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
acidity because these are based foods

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.590 
acidity because these are based foods
and<00:02:47.940> based<00:02:48.510> foods<00:02:48.900> help<00:02:49.350> prevent<00:02:50.270> they'd<00:02:51.270> help

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
and based foods help prevent they'd help

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.110 
and based foods help prevent they'd help
maintain<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.620> acid-base<00:02:53.280> balance<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.940> our

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
maintain that acid-base balance in our

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.660 
maintain that acid-base balance in our
body<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:54.660> bodies<00:02:54.960> always<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.740> state<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.520> flux

body or bodies always in a state of flux

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.050 
body or bodies always in a state of flux
so<00:02:57.540> um<00:02:57.860> those<00:02:58.860> are<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.040> two<00:02:59.280> main<00:02:59.460> purposes

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
so um those are the two main purposes

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.730 
so um those are the two main purposes
that<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.510> will<00:03:00.720> serve<00:03:01.020> now<00:03:01.290> let's<00:03:01.530> get<00:03:01.680> to

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
quite simple again it literally takes

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.570 
quite simple again it literally takes
minutes<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.720> get<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> bit<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.770> water<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.190> start

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
minutes I get a bit of water to start

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.960 
minutes I get a bit of water to start
off<00:03:08.730> with<00:03:09.000> that's<00:03:09.480> my<00:03:09.690> base<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.730> again<00:03:11.730> don't

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
off with that's my base and again don't

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.060 
off with that's my base and again don't
worry<00:03:12.090> about<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.630> vegetables<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.470> use<00:03:13.740> one

now<00:03:59.660> most<00:03:59.870> juicers<00:04:00.290> don't<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.370> power<00:04:01.940> to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
now most juicers don't have the power to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.090 
now most juicers don't have the power to
do<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:02.990> if<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.350> get<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> Vitamix

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
do that but if you can get a Vitamix

do that but if you can get a Vitamix
again<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.550> not<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.730> cheapest<00:04:05.150> thing<00:04:05.270> on<00:04:05.360> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450

market<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.990> is<00:04:06.020> probably<00:04:06.440> one<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> best

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890
