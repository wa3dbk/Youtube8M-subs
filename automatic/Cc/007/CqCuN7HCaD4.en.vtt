00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and how about youtube friends welcome 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.480
 to this new tutorial in which in this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.330
 I'm going to teach them how to play the 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.250
 song hopefully silvio rodrÃ­guez is 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 song is a classic that I do not think 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 must be missing in our repertoire les 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 I will teach what the arpeggio and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.460
 strumming that are very characteristic of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.840
 this song hopefully I can help you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 with this to which you can 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 execute and can sing to whom 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 you want good because we will 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.279
 start very well friends then for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.279
 start let's see what the arpeggio is like 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 we are not going to position on the fret 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.629
 number 10 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 in which we are going to be playing the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.990
 third the second and the first string 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.360
 and the fourth string will go to the air in 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.230
 what is the arpeggio pp that consists 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.300
 in giving the bass between later 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.350
 touch the third 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.439
 the second and the first 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.330
 and finally the second the third and the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.200
 second again 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.200
 thus 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.410
 and 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.180
 ok since we have more or less dominated 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.160
 the region what we are going to do for the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.800
 beginning of the song that is the intro 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.720
 and I think the first one is the first line 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.340
 of the stanza 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.340
 let's play like this 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.240
 the first string will go in the tenth 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 fret in the next one is going to go in the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 nineth 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.900
 then in the eighth 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.900
 and finally in the seventh 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.540
 and from the circle that manages the song 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.770
 so let's start with the first 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.830
 stanza and then we start with the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.190
 strum that the one who carries the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.190
 song 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.190
 Y 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.920
 ah 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.550
 live were the first stanzas 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 we remember to do the following 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.500
 chords and we already passed for the strum 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.830
 two new ones come out to the part where 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.830
 I did 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.590
 you 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.120
 this chord we're just going to weave a 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.120
 time 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.900
 for the laying of this song 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.240
 let's do the following we are going to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.990
 tear down once 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.990
 with fingers 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.130
 then let's tear it down with 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.670
 The thumb finger 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.670
 do not 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.599
 after we tear with the thumb 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.950
 down back we go up with 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.220
 the fingers that we have left of the next 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.220
 shape 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.019
 or not 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.620
 little bit faster 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.030
 and that is the strum we are going to make 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.980
 when the chorus of the song is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:42.170
 so when we do the prepare he 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.170
 the pre-chorus remains in this way 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.370
 ah 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.860
 ah 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.389
 we continue with arpeggios 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.550
 and when we have the first choir 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.500
 the second verse they touch the same 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.599
 chord circle that in the first 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.689
 stanza before the chorus equal in the pre 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.479
 choir but we all know that the last 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:35.750
 mail is longer it takes more chords and 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.990
 more letters then we would be left of the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.420
 next form 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.930
 applying from the pre color we 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.930
 it would be like that 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.229
 i 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.490
 i 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.820
 and to finish the song later 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.030
 of the choir we went to the circle of 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.030
 arpeggio 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.500
 and we will stay this way with everything 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.740
 and the end we will see the chords of 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.740
 final 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:09.879
 Y 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.760
 Y 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.629

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:37.220
 they are not easy 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.240
 but I remind you again that 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.699
 as long as you give him many 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.590
