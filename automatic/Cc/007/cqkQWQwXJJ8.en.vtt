00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.770
 okay for people see rose niall 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.690
 your majesty arrived through one 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.700
 lit the girl of better data on a 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.290
 Channel update log is not 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.480
 a peace of the channel so there are no 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.310
 changes but rather heavy official 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.290
 the change of a game in 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.240
 particular in these days like 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.540
 we know the peace of has arrived 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.930
 battlefield arline then the 1.02 patch 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.689
 if I'm not mistaken 1.01 I assume that 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.309
 he went to fix those heavy problems 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.629
 that did not allow a fluid gameplay 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.239
 and smooth including over power weapons 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.670
 netcode issues server problems 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.710
 and above all spawn problems what it is 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.909
 success in the last hours I tried to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.920
 make some gameplay 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.899
 I tried to make a video I tried 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.249
 in short, to see if they actually were 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.170
 change these things 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.789
 and finally arline could be 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.649
 played quietly 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.030
 and in short he did not give too many problems 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.920
 what I found myself in front of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.289
 eyes was the exact same game 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.089
 before the peace, that is to say, the end 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.220
 visceral do not overlook a beloved one 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.229
 fuck there are over power weapons 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.870
 still tried even the 16 m ha 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.640
 three have slightly decreased the rate 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.350
 of fire but it is forbidden even more precise 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 that is, from distance it is even more frightening 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.880
 land is said to be between k 10 do not have 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 noticed changes in fire rate but 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.659
 but they said that it has changed and 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.670
 let's say the damage level that this 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.390
 Rome creates but at the end of the evening of fire 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.729
 remains high the damage increases equally 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.049
 because if we remove maybe one 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.590
 percentage of damage from an individual 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.420
 hand bullet multiply by 24 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.310
 project 21 projectiles fired at the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.460
 speed of light in the end peace is 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.439
 useless and above all the problem of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.320
 spot I went to the server team 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.759
 deathmatch to see if indeed 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.560
 this problem had been fixed are 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.420
 went into the servers that sporting it then 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 not in the open maps he was anymore 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 difficult to find this problem e 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.329
 in the close curtin then for example the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.390
 villa hollywood and for example the 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.200
 suburb well this problem is still there 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.509
 all the effects 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.759
 initially the game seems to work 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.859
 well this fauna the far from the field of 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.090
 battle but this thing changes during 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.130
 the match 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.500
 after a few minutes of gameplay I am 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.660
 found a response 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.210
 behind the enemy lines to be 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.340
 eliminated as soon as it urged me because to the 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.350
 end the enemies realized that I am 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.750
 I undressed from them and I am directly 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.580
 found more enemies appear from nowhere 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.380
 in the middle of the map or directly 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.480
 in front of my eyes while I was 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.280
 again in my main spawn then 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.440
 away from the battlefield 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.990
 so this sports problem is not 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.400
 it was absolutely fixed indeed it seems 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.990
 work for the first few minutes of 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.459
 gameplay and then messing up and coming back 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.320
 exactly as it was before peace 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.959
 so what led me to do this 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.900
 problem made me lead to 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.030
 decision to eliminate hardline I have it 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.100
 uninstalled from the computer because me 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.160
 I'm really tired of this title 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.590
 because in the end it was what it was 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.120
 maybe frantic arcade but unfortunately 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.770
 these problems won't let you 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.050
 have a fluid gameplay you don't 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.630
 allow you to have fun as you would like 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.700
 and unfortunately you only end up 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.680
 in poorly managed servers where people 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.980
 as we know they make their own cabbage 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.630
 and unfortunately even the players themselves do not 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.220
 help this factor 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.350
 so guys beat fidar lyle ho 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.290
 uninstalled from my pc I deleted it 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.060
 will come back maybe if a decent 10 comes 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.030
 if I don't give a fuck about it at most 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.440
 I spent so much money and my 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.320
 decision precisely and to come back up 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.200
 battlefield 3 as always and more 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.760
 battlefield 4 because it is now with the new ones 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.470
 patch has therefore since we all know 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.329
 how many beats 4 has finally been 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.730
 ct is still there and that is 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.250
 still working to optimize it more 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.160
 and moreover, between a month and 2, the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.640
 again say free that will add one 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.709
 jungle map if I'm wrong and new weapons 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.970
 then it will even come back in 94 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.160
 a goes to cannes because I peeked a little 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.709
 in the forums then weapons will return 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.120
 old and new on the world debates 4 e 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.070
 since in the end it was a good game 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.750
 I want to take it back to full 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.239
 so guys busted arline seriglia 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.019
 in that ass and we continue for the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.549
 our way 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.440
 obviously and will be back in the grand video 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.880
 theft auto when i feel like doing them e 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.530
 also killing floor that had a 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.540
 great success among you 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.130
 so guys we follow each other 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.160
 under hugs vast mastandrea from three 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.070
 on board was that we were there 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.360
 see you next time 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.400
 I think now it will throw away 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.400
 I don't know a used computer
