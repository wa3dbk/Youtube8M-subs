tutorials and I've been making them for

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.320 
tutorials and I've been making them for
a<00:00:14.570> little<00:00:14.660> while<00:00:14.780> now<00:00:15.140> I<00:00:15.380> am<00:00:16.070> going<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:16.580> now<00:00:17.029> be

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
a little while now I am going to now be

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.690 
a little while now I am going to now be
teaching<00:00:17.750> you<00:00:17.900> how<00:00:18.470> would<00:00:18.530> you<00:00:18.860> do<00:00:19.130> tiger

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
teaching you how would you do tiger

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.850 
teaching you how would you do tiger
stripes<00:00:20.060> now<00:00:20.390> tiger<00:00:21.080> stripes<00:00:21.410> can<00:00:21.590> be<00:00:21.710> done<00:00:21.830> a

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
stripes now tiger stripes can be done a

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.500 
stripes now tiger stripes can be done a
lot<00:00:22.100> of<00:00:22.160> different<00:00:22.340> ways<00:00:22.640> but<00:00:22.940> my<00:00:23.119> particular

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
lot of different ways but my particular

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.750 
lot of different ways but my particular
favorite<00:00:24.110> way<00:00:24.230> to<00:00:24.260> do<00:00:24.470> them<00:00:24.619> is<00:00:24.860> using<00:00:25.460> a

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
favorite way to do them is using a

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.730 
favorite way to do them is using a
number<00:00:26.210> 5<00:00:26.390> round<00:00:26.690> brush<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.289> reason<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.590> like

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
number 5 round brush the reason I like

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.019 
number 5 round brush the reason I like
to<00:00:27.770> do<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:28.190> because<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.490> end<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.789> very

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
to do that is because the end is very

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.510 
to do that is because the end is very
small<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:30.199> middle<00:00:30.470> is<00:00:30.529> quite<00:00:30.770> thick<00:00:31.039> so

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
small and the middle is quite thick so

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.610 
small and the middle is quite thick so
it<00:00:31.670> gives<00:00:31.939> you<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.329> ability<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:32.809> vary<00:00:33.350> the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
it gives you the ability to vary the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.130 
it gives you the ability to vary the
size<00:00:34.100> and<00:00:34.489> width<00:00:34.729> of<00:00:34.969> your<00:00:35.030> tiger<00:00:35.929> straight

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
size and width of your tiger straight

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.649 
size and width of your tiger straight
brush<00:00:36.350> in<00:00:36.589> one<00:00:36.800> streak<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.149> you're<00:00:38.269> gonna<00:00:38.390> load

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
brush in one streak so you're gonna load

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.270 
brush in one streak so you're gonna load
your<00:00:38.870> brush<00:00:38.960> up<00:00:39.229> with<00:00:39.469> some<00:00:39.710> black<00:00:39.920> paint<00:00:40.190> and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
your brush up with some black paint and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.680 
your brush up with some black paint and
I've<00:00:40.429> gone<00:00:40.550> ahead<00:00:40.699> and<00:00:40.850> I've<00:00:41.030> already<00:00:41.179> sponged

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
I've gone ahead and I've already sponged

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.559 
I've gone ahead and I've already sponged
some<00:00:42.350> color<00:00:42.649> onto<00:00:43.069> the<00:00:43.399> side<00:00:43.699> of<00:00:43.879> my<00:00:44.030> face<00:00:44.269> so

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
some color onto the side of my face so

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.569 
some color onto the side of my face so
that<00:00:44.600> they<00:00:44.780> show<00:00:44.960> up<00:00:45.079> really<00:00:45.409> well<00:00:45.589> so<00:00:45.889> what

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
that they show up really well so what

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.309 
that they show up really well so what
you<00:00:46.729> want<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:46.969> do<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:47.719> want<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:47.960> start<00:00:48.199> out

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
you want to do is you want to start out

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.799 
you want to do is you want to start out
thin<00:00:48.679> and<00:00:48.979> you<00:00:49.429> want<00:00:49.639> to<00:00:49.729> drag<00:00:50.030> your<00:00:50.690> brush

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
thin and you want to drag your brush

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.689 
thin and you want to drag your brush
downward<00:00:51.469> applying<00:00:51.979> pressure<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.370> make<00:00:52.579> it

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
downward applying pressure to make it

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.699 
downward applying pressure to make it
thick<00:00:52.879> make<00:00:53.329> it<00:00:53.449> thin<00:00:53.659> again<00:00:53.959> you<00:00:54.229> can<00:00:54.469> wiggle

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:54.709 
thick make it thin again you can wiggle

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:57.219 
thick make it thin again you can wiggle
a<00:00:54.949> little<00:00:55.219> bit<00:00:55.370> when<00:00:55.519> you<00:00:55.609> push<00:00:55.850> down<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.479> drag

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
a little bit when you push down and drag

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.139 
a little bit when you push down and drag
away<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:57.829> you're<00:00:57.949> gonna<00:00:58.069> leave<00:00:58.219> them<00:00:58.639> thick

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
away so you're gonna leave them thick

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.329 
away so you're gonna leave them thick
then<00:00:59.600> let<00:01:00.469> me<00:01:00.559> show<00:01:00.709> you<00:01:00.769> what<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:00.979> mean<00:01:01.129> by<00:01:01.190> that

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
then let me show you what I mean by that

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.370 
then let me show you what I mean by that
you're<00:01:02.149> gonna<00:01:02.239> start<00:01:02.479> out<00:01:02.600> really<00:01:02.809> thin<00:01:05.380> apply

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
you're gonna start out really thin apply

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.500 
you're gonna start out really thin apply
a<00:01:06.409> little<00:01:06.650> pressure

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
a little pressure

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.350 
a little pressure
lift<00:01:08.510> up<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:09.040> drag<00:01:10.040> away<00:01:10.190> like<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.880> if

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
lift up and drag away like that and if

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.090 
lift up and drag away like that and if
you're<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.540> top<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.110> little<00:01:12.380> thick<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.920> can

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
you're a top is a little thick you can

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.890 
you're a top is a little thick you can
even<00:01:13.370> drag<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.030> up<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.240> little<00:01:14.330> bit<00:01:14.600> more<00:01:14.780> and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
even drag it up a little bit more and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800 
even drag it up a little bit more and
they<00:01:15.020> get<00:01:15.140> thinner<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:17.300> you're<00:01:17.450> gonna<00:01:17.540> start

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
they get thinner so you're gonna start

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.040 
they get thinner so you're gonna start
thin<00:01:18.140> apply<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> little<00:01:19.130> more<00:01:19.250> pressure<00:01:20.050> think

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
thin apply a little more pressure think

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.040 
thin apply a little more pressure think
you<00:01:21.800> can<00:01:22.010> get<00:01:22.220> thick<00:01:22.550> again<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.240> go<00:01:23.780> through

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
you can get thick again and go through

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.770 
you can get thick again and go through
them<00:01:24.170> again<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.980> you've<00:01:25.130> got<00:01:25.370> varying<00:01:26.060> widths

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
them again so you've got varying widths

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.530 
them again so you've got varying widths
and<00:01:26.990> thickness<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.830> your<00:01:28.310> stripes<00:01:28.850> size

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.160 

then<00:01:35.370> dick

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.600 

and<00:01:41.170> think<00:01:42.210> yeah<00:01:43.650> they<00:01:44.650> can<00:01:44.770> also<00:01:44.920> attach<00:01:45.310> to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
and think yeah they can also attach to

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.040 
and think yeah they can also attach to
each<00:01:45.730> other<00:01:45.880> at<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.150> top<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.450> feels<00:01:46.630> like<00:01:46.810> and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
each other at the top of feels like and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.300 
each other at the top of feels like and
you<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.320> go<00:01:47.440> thin<00:01:47.740> thick<00:01:48.670> thin<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.100> just

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
you can go thin thick thin and you just

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.130 
you can go thin thick thin and you just
want<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.520> vary<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.090> thickness<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.630> little<00:01:52.990> bit

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
want to vary the thickness a little bit

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.570 
want to vary the thickness a little bit
so<00:01:53.350> they're<00:01:53.470> not<00:01:53.650> right<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.160> thick<00:01:54.370> spots

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
so they're not right the thick spots

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.830 
so they're not right the thick spots
aren't<00:01:54.850> right<00:01:55.000> next<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.330> each<00:01:55.420> other<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.750> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
aren't right next to each other in the
