00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello dear friends I suggest 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.799
 your attention is unique and the most 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.410
 the best screed for your floor made 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.809
 from ordinary sawdust why unique 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.809
 because similar information in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.090
 on the Internet you will not find anywhere 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.699
 you say what it will give me and why 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.210
 I need this thing in that screed 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.269
 zapilov 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.939
 has a lot of advantages 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:31.199
 first it is environmentally friendly not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:35.280
 contains harmful materials the second is very 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.040
 cheap consists of 70 percent sawdust 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 which you can purchase in the summer 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.649
 any sawmill for nothing and you even for it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.570
 can say thank you for taking out 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.629
 garbage 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 the third sawdust is very warm and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.320
 can be used as 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.730
 insulation 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 4 incredibly durable on the slide you can 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.619
 see the screed from the sawdust which outwardly 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.769
 no different from a conventional screed and 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.850
 plaster 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.210
 also made with adding a beer for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.540
 heat preservation 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.090
 the screed is made very simple 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 consists of two layers the first layer is the bottom 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 one bucket of cement two sand buckets 6 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.310
 sawdust buckets second layer top single 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 buckets of cement two people sand 3 people 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.549
 beer and the first layer, we need to heat and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.960
 the second layer we need is more durable 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.049
 so that there is less abrasion sex ecu 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.500
 and he was more durable you can 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.030
 doubt the information said because 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.350
 that I also doubted 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.070
 very much when the first time poured 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.500
 sawdust floors 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.799
 then to the last he doubted that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.009
 maybe something will result 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.619
 of course surpassed all my expectations and here 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.849
 For over five years now I have been making a screed from 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.420
 sawdust to order people and only get 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.709
 by 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.270
 individual reviews follow this link 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.160
 You will find more information about 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 screed of plaster chips with 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.520
 adding sawdust and even blocks that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.700
 also made of sawdust wall blocks 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.510
 which fit into the wall hold 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.310
 warm and very durable 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.140
 thank you very much for your attention with you 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.140
