00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
cameras these are very strong we've

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.549 
cameras these are very strong we've
tested<00:00:48.829> these<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.429> 70<00:00:49.820> pounds<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.559> right

tested these to 70 pounds and right

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.410 
tested these to 70 pounds and right
about<00:00:51.800> 70<00:00:52.190> pounds<00:00:52.339> is<00:00:52.609> when<00:00:52.760> they<00:00:52.910> started<00:00:53.239> to

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
about 70 pounds is when they started to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.069 
about 70 pounds is when they started to
give<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:53.929> break<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.329> we're<00:00:56.329> pretty<00:00:56.480> confident

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
give and break so we're pretty confident

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.680 
give and break so we're pretty confident
that<00:00:57.140> your<00:00:57.499> point<00:00:57.800> shoot<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.489> your<00:00:58.969> GPS<00:00:59.359> are

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
that your point shoot and your GPS are

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.250 
that your point shoot and your GPS are
going<00:00:59.839> to<00:00:59.899> be<00:01:00.019> pretty<00:01:00.289> safe<00:01:00.530> at<00:01:00.769> bat<00:01:01.480> so<00:01:02.480> then

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
going to be pretty safe at bat so then

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.960 
going to be pretty safe at bat so then
we<00:01:03.409> would<00:01:03.530> give<00:01:03.769> ourselves<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.250> little<00:01:04.280> loop<00:01:04.699> we

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
sit right in the middle there and it

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.450 
sit right in the middle there and it

we've been using on our monkey fists for

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.020 
we've been using on our monkey fists for
quite<00:01:43.579> a<00:01:43.610> while<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.439> we<00:01:45.439> use<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:46.250> Celtic

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
quite a while so we use a a Celtic

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.010 
quite a while so we use a a Celtic
button<00:01:47.390> knot<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.960> end<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:49.210> then<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.420> do

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
button knot on the end and then we do

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.069 
button knot on the end and then we do
another<00:01:51.259> Celtic<00:01:51.740> button<00:01:52.070> knot<00:01:52.539> around<00:01:53.539> that

another Celtic button knot around that

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.109 
another Celtic button knot around that
so<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.590> puts<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:55.009> singe<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.520> either<00:01:55.729> side

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
so that it puts a singe on either side

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.510 
so that it puts a singe on either side
instead<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.229> singe<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.710> both<00:01:57.950> sides<00:01:58.280> that

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
instead of a singe on both sides that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.149 
instead of a singe on both sides that
you<00:01:58.700> would<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:59.030> on<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> lanyard<00:01:59.539> not<00:02:00.009> makes<00:02:01.009> it

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
you would get on a lanyard not makes it

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.380 
you would get on a lanyard not makes it
a<00:02:01.189> little<00:02:01.280> bit<00:02:01.430> cleaner<00:02:01.729> because<00:02:02.090> there's<00:02:02.270> not

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
a little bit cleaner because there's not

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.410 
a little bit cleaner because there's not
quite<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:02.899> much<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.369> singe<00:02:04.700> all<00:02:04.969> in<00:02:05.240> one
