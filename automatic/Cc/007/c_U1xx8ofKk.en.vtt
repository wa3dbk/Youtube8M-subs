different aspects of piano technique I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.570 
different aspects of piano technique I
thought<00:00:09.630> they<00:00:09.870> would<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.170> look<00:00:10.530> at<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
thought they would have a look at one of

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
thought they would have a look at one of
the<00:00:11.730> difficulties<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.210> pianists<00:00:12.750> often

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the difficulties that pianists often

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.470 
the difficulties that pianists often
face<00:00:13.320> which<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.250> when<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.730> asked<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.299> play

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
face which is when we are asked to play

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
face which is when we are asked to play
twos<00:00:15.780> dense<00:00:16.080> threes<00:00:16.529> that's<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.070> were<00:00:17.190> asked

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
twos dense threes that's when were asked

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.570 
twos dense threes that's when were asked
to<00:00:17.460> care<00:00:17.670> duplet<00:00:18.150> rhythm<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.619> even<00:00:19.920> quavers<00:00:20.550> in

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to care duplet rhythm so even quavers in

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.540 
to care duplet rhythm so even quavers in
our<00:00:20.850> left<00:00:21.000> hand<00:00:23.600> against<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.750> triplet<00:00:25.320> rhythm

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
our left hand against a triplet rhythm

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.830 
our left hand against a triplet rhythm
groups<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.699> three<00:00:27.000> quantities<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> right

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
groups of three quantities in the right

I'm about to show you may well help with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.350 
I'm about to show you may well help with
that<00:00:40.489> quite<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> good<00:00:41.730> way<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> doing<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.239> very

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that quite a good way of doing it very

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
that quite a good way of doing it very
first<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> trying<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
first of all I think is trying to do it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.700 
first of all I think is trying to do it
completely<00:00:44.460> away<00:00:45.000> from<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> piano<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.930> start

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
completely away from the piano and start

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.549 
completely away from the piano and start
off<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.670> tapping<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.360> knees<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.410> this

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
off by tapping on your knees so in this

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.500 
off by tapping on your knees so in this
hand<00:00:49.829> means<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> worry<00:00:51.420> about

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
hand means that I have to worry about

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
hand means that I have to worry about
any<00:00:51.719> notes<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.230> anything<00:00:52.410> specifically<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
any notes or anything specifically I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.650 
any notes or anything specifically I
could<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.550> warrant<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.149> asleep<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
could just warrant to asleep at the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.950 
could just warrant to asleep at the
rhythm

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
rhythm

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
rhythm
so<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.620> hand<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.010> could<00:00:56.129> attack<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.610> dupe

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so this hand I could attack my dupe

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.209 
so this hand I could attack my dupe
number<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.660> queens<00:00:57.960> per<00:00:58.199> beat<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.100> then

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
number them two queens per beat and then

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.740 
number them two queens per beat and then
in<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.430> hand<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:03.030> check<00:01:03.239> my<00:01:03.359> triplet

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
in this hand I would check my triplet

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
in this hand I would check my triplet
rhythm<00:01:05.420> now<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> useful<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> help<00:01:08.010> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
rhythm now it can be useful to help you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
rhythm now it can be useful to help you
to<00:01:08.369> keep<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.700> time<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> use<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> metronome<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
to keep in time to use a metronome so

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.130 
to keep in time to use a metronome so
I'm<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> metronome<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:15.140> just

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
I'm going to put a metronome on just

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.100 
I'm going to put a metronome on just
focus<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.610> 60<00:01:18.180> fairly<00:01:18.540> slow<00:01:18.810> tempo<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
focus on about 60 fairly slow tempo so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
focus on about 60 fairly slow tempo so
as<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.650> listen<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.070> lady<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.759> to

practice
tapping<00:01:25.380> du+<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> hand<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.909> then<00:01:27.270> swap

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
tapping du+ in this hand and then swap

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
tapping du+ in this hand and then swap
the<00:01:27.900> triplets<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.439> yellow<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:29.009> keep<00:01:29.250> soft

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the triplets in yellow not keep soft

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
the triplets in yellow not keep soft
between<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> two<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.710> more

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
between the two and then as I get more

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.600 
between the two and then as I get more
used<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.189> i'm<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> practice

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
used to that i'm going to practice

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:54.170 
used to that i'm going to practice
talking<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.390> frequently<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.520> so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
talking more frequently so and so on so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.730 
talking more frequently so and so on so
i'm<00:01:54.299> hopefully<00:01:54.750> getting<00:01:54.930> used<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> having<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
i'm hopefully getting used to having the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.319 
i'm hopefully getting used to having the
feel<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> two<00:01:56.520> different<00:01:56.850> beats<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.210> each

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
feel of the two different beats in each

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:57.910 
feel of the two different beats in each
hand

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
hand

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
hand
next<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.009> will<00:01:59.219> try<00:01:59.520> just<00:02:00.090> warm<00:02:00.420> group<00:02:00.750> together

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
next I will try just warm group together

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.139 
next I will try just warm group together
to<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.649> how

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.520 

once<00:02:09.149> I've<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.600> hang<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
once I've got the hang of that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.940 
once I've got the hang of that
I'll<00:02:11.310> stop<00:02:11.610> putting<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.120> rooms<00:02:12.330> together

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.990 

and<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.940> could<00:02:21.060> build<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:23.000> some

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and so on you could build it up some

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.970 
and so on you could build it up some
things<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.360> might<00:02:24.660> help<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.530> put<00:02:25.890> an

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
things that might help you is to put an

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.400 
things that might help you is to put an
accent<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> strong<00:02:27.840> beat<00:02:28.020> where<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> beds

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
accent on the strong beat where the beds

come<00:02:28.620> together<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.210> get<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> strong<00:02:33.690> beat

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990

come together so you get a strong beat
they're<00:02:34.290> also<00:02:34.800> simplifying<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> quite

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
they're also simplifying it quite

P<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.680> could<00:03:01.770> be<00:03:01.800> quite<00:03:02.040> useful<00:03:02.310> way<00:03:02.580> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
P so that could be quite useful way of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.490 
P so that could be quite useful way of
doing<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.209> once<00:03:03.750> you've<00:03:03.930> got<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.080> hang<00:03:04.320> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
doing it now once you've got a hang of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.370 
doing it now once you've got a hang of
doing<00:03:04.530> rhythms<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:07.140> then

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
doing rhythms like that and it's then

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.500 
doing rhythms like that and it's then
worth<00:03:07.920> trying<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.400> put<00:03:08.580> onto<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.970> piano<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
worth trying to put onto the piano and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.690 
worth trying to put onto the piano and
we'll<00:03:10.200> do<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> same<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.980> practice<00:03:11.400> so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
we'll do the same kind of practice so

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.670 
we'll do the same kind of practice so
what<00:03:12.360> I'm<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:12.989> use<00:03:13.230> C<00:03:13.500> major

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
what I'm going to do is use C major

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.699 
what I'm going to do is use C major
scale<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.340> at<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> top<00:03:15.360> pad<00:03:15.600> which<00:03:16.560> my

trying<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.510> go<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.740> could<00:03:44.860> try<00:03:45.040> to

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
trying to go then you could try to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:54.240 
trying to go then you could try to
practice<00:03:45.700> two<00:03:45.850> groups<00:03:46.120> together<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.920> should

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
practice two groups together it should

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.029 

but<00:04:21.539> you<00:04:21.630> could<00:04:21.810> swap<00:04:22.019> over<00:04:22.229> Topsy<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.340 

and<00:04:37.699> once<00:04:38.660> you've<00:04:38.810> got<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.050> hang<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.289> doing

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and once you've got the hang of doing

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.159 
and once you've got the hang of doing
exercise<00:04:40.069> like<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.389> on<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.630> piano<00:04:41.900> and

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
exercise like that on the piano and

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.600 
exercise like that on the piano and
obviously<00:04:42.410> doing<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.770> top<00:04:43.009> of<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.220> knees<00:04:43.370> of

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
obviously doing the top of the knees of

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.439 
obviously doing the top of the knees of
way<00:04:43.789> from<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.090> piano

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
way from the piano

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.300 
way from the piano
hopefully<00:04:45.259> you're<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:45.620> at<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> stage<00:04:46.069> where

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
hopefully you're then at the stage where

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.570 
hopefully you're then at the stage where
you<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.430> start<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.860> tackle<00:04:48.860> passages<00:04:49.430> in

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
you can start to tackle passages in

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.040 
you can start to tackle passages in
pieces<00:04:50.000> where<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.210> have<00:04:50.419> these<00:04:50.539> twos<00:04:50.810> against

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
pieces where you have these twos against

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.749 
pieces where you have these twos against
three<00:04:51.319> rhythms<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.800> may<00:04:52.340> want<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.639> fight

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
three rhythms you may want to fight

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.909 
three rhythms you may want to fight
after<00:04:53.120> doing<00:04:53.300> these<00:04:53.389> exercises<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.289> can<00:04:54.800> go

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
after doing these exercises you can go

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.529 
after doing these exercises you can go
straight<00:04:55.190> into<00:04:55.310> those<00:04:55.729> passages<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.449> you

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
straight into those passages and you

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:57.939 
straight into those passages and you
don't<00:04:56.720> have<00:04:56.870> any<00:04:57.020> problems<00:04:57.530> playing<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
don't have any problems playing the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
similar practice with a metronome so you

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.189 
similar practice with a metronome so you
might<00:05:04.490> just<00:05:04.520> practice<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.419> left<00:05:05.660> hand<00:05:05.990> and

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
might just practice the left hand and

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.379 
might just practice the left hand and
then<00:05:06.830> practice<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.280> top<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.880> they<00:05:07.970> gradually

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
then practice the top and they gradually

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.920 
then practice the top and they gradually
build<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.840> up<00:05:09.099> but<00:05:10.099> hopefully<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:11.330> will<00:05:11.690> help

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
build it up but hopefully that will help

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.089 
build it up but hopefully that will help
a<00:05:12.020> little<00:05:12.110> bit<00:05:12.320> with<00:05:12.380> putting<00:05:12.770> these<00:05:12.860> twos

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
a little bit with putting these twos

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.070 
a little bit with putting these twos
