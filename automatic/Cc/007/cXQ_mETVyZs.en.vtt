stretched<00:01:11.260> in<00:01:11.530> this<00:01:11.710> direction<00:01:11.940> then<00:01:12.940> we<00:01:13.180> do

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
stretched in this direction then we do

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.940 
stretched in this direction then we do
the<00:01:13.770> next<00:01:14.770> leg<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.780> make<00:01:17.020> sure<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.440> position

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
the next leg but make sure you position

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
this so that it this crossbar will be a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.660 
this so that it this crossbar will be a
little<00:01:25.810> bit<00:01:26.050> shorter<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.159> could<00:01:27.430> wedge

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
little bit shorter so you could wedge

little bit shorter so you could wedge
and<00:01:28.390> stretch<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.850> me<00:01:31.060> about<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.390> sixteenth<00:01:32.970> so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
and stretch just me about a sixteenth so

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.090 
and stretch just me about a sixteenth so
make<00:01:34.179> sure<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:34.990> little<00:01:35.229> smaller<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.710> that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
make sure it's a little smaller and that

parallel with this site and a little
smaller<00:01:46.149> so<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.690> can<00:01:46.899> stretch<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.770> with

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
smaller so that you can stretch it with

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.970 
smaller so that you can stretch it with
this<00:01:48.340> piece

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.670 

i<00:01:52.070> tacked<00:01:53.030> down<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:55.810> make<00:01:56.810> sure<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.440> gap
