 this second video I would like to see 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 what was my all-open approach 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.490
 ended playing that exactly the first 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 things I did years ago with initial 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 let's say experiment with this way of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420
 I play experimental because I am 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.330
 right but I started playing also from 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 left-handed never years ago following some gods 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.580
 My myths of the period is still rumors 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 so for example simon phillips and cards 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.300
 before then the first exercises are gods 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 simple beats of the very simple cranes 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.500
 play with your left hand on the yet 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.300
 well in the second part of this video 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
 I'll play a page from one of the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.039
 grigesi books called feedback where 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.709
 we have several transfers with the cashier 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.789
 while the snare drum always plays on the 2 on the 4 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.220
 of the measure 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.929
 in total there are 15 combinations and the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.520
 end of each lap I will change the 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.160
 figuration played by my hand 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 weak only on diet or under 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.229
 most used figurations 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.960
 second more musical then eighths with 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.130
 different accents and sixteenths 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.290
 I must say that I do this exercise 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.270
