going<00:00:30.999> to<00:00:31.089> work<00:00:31.119> now<00:00:31.329> these<00:00:31.839> cables<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.290> bit

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
going to work now these cables a bit

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.410 
going to work now these cables a bit
long<00:00:32.590> here<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:32.950> one<00:00:33.579> of<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.760> benefits<00:00:34.210> of<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
long here but one of the benefits of the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.850 
long here but one of the benefits of the
fpv<00:00:34.720> you<00:00:34.780> backpackers<00:00:35.200> that<00:00:35.350> I<00:00:35.380> put<00:00:35.590> applied

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
fpv you backpackers that I put applied

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.250 
fpv you backpackers that I put applied
between<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.310> wrists<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.090> camera<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.050> the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
between the wrists of the camera and the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.709 
between the wrists of the camera and the
board<00:00:38.590> so<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.250> just<00:00:39.460> plug<00:00:39.699> this<00:00:39.820> in<00:00:40.059> series<00:00:40.510> this

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
board so I just plug this in series this

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.090 
board so I just plug this in series this
little<00:00:41.020> thing<00:00:41.350> plugs<00:00:41.590> in<00:00:41.710> series<00:00:41.949> with<00:00:42.039> the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
little thing plugs in series with the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.920 
little thing plugs in series with the
camera<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.609> it<00:00:43.030> has<00:00:43.120> another<00:00:43.300> lead<00:00:43.539> off<00:00:43.690> I'll

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
camera and it has another lead off I'll

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.959 
camera and it has another lead off I'll
show<00:00:44.109> you<00:00:44.199> on<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.379> other<00:00:44.410> side<00:00:44.559> over<00:00:44.920> here<00:00:45.010> now

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
show you on the other side over here now

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.069 
show you on the other side over here now
the<00:00:46.030> little<00:00:46.269> lead<00:00:46.420> here<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:46.690> goes<00:00:46.809> off<00:00:46.960> to

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
the little lead here that goes off to

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.959 
the little lead here that goes off to
the<00:00:47.199> voltage<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.739> comes<00:00:48.430> into<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.789> backpack

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
the voltage that comes into the backpack

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.549 
the voltage that comes into the backpack
so<00:00:49.329> that<00:00:49.840> should<00:00:49.989> give<00:00:50.079> us<00:00:50.109> an<00:00:50.230> on-screen

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
so that should give us an on-screen

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.759 
so that should give us an on-screen
voltage<00:00:51.100> display<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.850> show<00:00:52.239> us<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:52.769> what's

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
voltage display and show us that what's

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.979 
voltage display and show us that what's
our<00:00:53.920> time<00:00:54.219> I<00:00:54.250> believe<00:00:54.730> now<00:00:55.269> as<00:00:55.449> that's<00:00:55.719> very

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
our time I believe now as that's very

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.139 
our time I believe now as that's very
cheap<00:00:56.170> not<00:00:56.859> expecting<00:00:57.429> an<00:00:57.519> awful<00:00:57.789> lot<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.090> is

don't<00:03:03.500> have<00:03:03.590> too<00:03:03.680> much<00:03:03.770> trouble<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.760> if<00:03:04.850> you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
don't have too much trouble but if you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.160 
don't have too much trouble but if you
want<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.270> little<00:03:05.390> bit<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.569> safety<00:03:05.810> little<00:03:06.080> bit

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
want a little bit of safety little bit

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.600 
want a little bit of safety little bit
of<00:03:06.230> margin<00:03:06.530> reserve<00:03:06.920> maybe<00:03:07.160> if<00:03:07.280> you're<00:03:07.400> flying

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
of margin reserve maybe if you're flying

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.970 
of margin reserve maybe if you're flying
the<00:03:07.700> bear<00:03:07.820> back<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.709> quadrotor<00:03:09.709> or

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
the bear back on a quadrotor or

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.550 
the bear back on a quadrotor or
multi-rotor<00:03:10.459> where<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.870> really<00:03:12.200> don't<00:03:12.350> want

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
multi-rotor where you really don't want

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.410 
multi-rotor where you really don't want
the<00:03:12.650> better<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.950> go<00:03:13.070> flat<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:14.300> would<00:03:14.390> be

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the better to go flat then that would be

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.449 
the better to go flat then that would be
a<00:03:14.540> worthwhile<00:03:14.720> addition<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.800> guess<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.220> 10

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
a worthwhile addition and I guess for 10

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.420 
a worthwhile addition and I guess for 10
bucks<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:16.970> there<00:03:17.150> abouts<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.900> why<00:03:18.590> not<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:19.100> mean

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
bucks or there abouts you why not I mean

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.610 
bucks or there abouts you why not I mean
ten<00:03:19.880> bucks<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.239> two<00:03:20.330> or<00:03:20.390> three<00:03:20.540> grams<00:03:20.810> it's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
ten bucks and two or three grams it's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.900 
ten bucks and two or three grams it's
probably<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> useful<00:03:22.250> addition<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> beer

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
probably a useful addition to the beer

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.290 
probably a useful addition to the beer

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
you don't have to fill it because as I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.190 
you don't have to fill it because as I
said<00:03:27.709> it's<00:03:28.220> really<00:03:28.340> really<00:03:28.940> easy<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.480> put<00:03:30.110> this

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200

on<00:03:30.380> take<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.709> off<00:03:30.800> it's<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.640> plugs<00:03:31.850> in

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
on take it off it's just just plugs in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.970 
on take it off it's just just plugs in
between<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.330> camera<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.989> transmitter

board and another plug just plugs in

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.630 
board and another plug just plugs in
from<00:03:35.840> your<00:03:35.989> battery<00:03:36.290> here<00:03:36.590> piece<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.100> cake<00:03:37.400> so

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
from your battery here piece of cake so

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.910 
from your battery here piece of cake so
there<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:38.329> go<00:03:38.510> if<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.750> want<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.230> use<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.650> you

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
there you go if you want to use this you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.670 
there you go if you want to use this you
can<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:41.450> probably<00:03:41.780> would<00:03:41.870> do<00:03:42.019> no<00:03:42.200> harm<00:03:42.230> and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
can and it probably would do no harm and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.910 
can and it probably would do no harm and
for<00:03:43.220> ten<00:03:43.370> bucks<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:44.390> probably<00:03:44.810> not<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> bad

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
for ten bucks it's probably not a bad

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.979 
for ten bucks it's probably not a bad
addition<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.120> should<00:03:47.540> point<00:03:47.690> out<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:47.959> course

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
addition I should point out of course

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.020 
addition I should point out of course
that<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:49.280> little<00:03:49.459> there's<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.700> little<00:03:49.880> button

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
that this little there's a little button

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.310 
that this little there's a little button
on<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.480> can<00:03:50.600> push<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.989> can<00:03:51.110> change

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
on here you can push that you can change

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.890 
on here you can push that you can change
the<00:03:51.440> position<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.280> various<00:03:53.239> things<00:03:53.690> so

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
the position of the various things so

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.170 
the position of the various things so
it's<00:03:54.049> got<00:03:54.170> about<00:03:54.290> 50<00:03:54.829> or<00:03:54.920> 60<00:03:55.040> modes<00:03:55.579> they<00:03:55.970> call

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
it's got about 50 or 60 modes they call

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.550 
it's got about 50 or 60 modes they call
them<00:03:56.299> which<00:03:56.480> just<00:03:56.720> changes<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.140> position<00:03:57.470> of

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
them which just changes the position of

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.440 
them which just changes the position of
the<00:03:57.650> voltage<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.310> timer<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:59.120> put<00:03:59.269> it<00:03:59.329> in<00:03:59.420> a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
the voltage and the timer to put it in a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.970 
the voltage and the timer to put it in a
position<00:03:59.540> net<00:03:59.900> specs<00:04:00.170> more<00:04:00.380> suitable<00:04:00.739> for<00:04:00.920> you

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
position net specs more suitable for you

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.620 
position net specs more suitable for you
when<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.730> first<00:04:02.000> turned<00:04:02.180> on<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.510> voltage

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
when I to first turned on the voltage

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.350 
when I to first turned on the voltage
was<00:04:02.989> up<00:04:03.140> here<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.730> couldn't<00:04:05.000> really<00:04:05.150> read

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
was up here and I couldn't really read

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.479 
was up here and I couldn't really read
that<00:04:05.510> very<00:04:05.690> well<00:04:05.980> because<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.130> my<00:04:07.160> fetch

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
that very well because of my fetch

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.039 
that very well because of my fetch
action<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:07.820> have<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> big<00:04:08.090> fetch<00:04:08.690> act<00:04:08.870> based

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049

Edition they get fuzzy near the corners

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.160 
Edition they get fuzzy near the corners
well<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.940> was<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.209> fuzzy<00:04:11.480> corner<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:11.930> I

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
well it was in the fuzzy corner so I

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.930 
well it was in the fuzzy corner so I
ended<00:04:12.860> up<00:04:13.010> stepping<00:04:13.280> through<00:04:13.519> all<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.760> modes

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
ended up stepping through all the modes

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.370 
ended up stepping through all the modes
until<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.239> found<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.630> down<00:04:14.959> here<00:04:15.140> somewhere

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
until I found it down here somewhere

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.890 
until I found it down here somewhere
which<00:04:15.650> was<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.459> ideal<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:17.180> me<00:04:17.329> nice<00:04:17.870> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
which was just ideal for me nice and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.930 
which was just ideal for me nice and

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
sharp in that corner of my fetch arcs so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.699 
sharp in that corner of my fetch arcs so
there<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.120> go<00:04:20.269> that's<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.109> another<00:04:21.470> part<00:04:21.680> of
