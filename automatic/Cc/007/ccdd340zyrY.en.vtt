00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 then let's see how to create a collapse a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:10.860
 free hand we click in this case 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.130
 I choose a photo as a background for mine 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.130
 collage 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.359
 here I click but I wish this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 fund is a little different then that co 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.660
 2 times and change the photo this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.539
 bucket or take me directly into the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.910
 photo lab where I can 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.420
 choose for example between frames 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 or directly edit the photo i 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.870
 photo colors or in this case or 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 choose between the proposed filters 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.239
 which is more appropriate to me 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.239
 in this case I will choose this here 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 old clichÃ© the possibility of 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 customize in those who are already very great 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 so I can choose for example from 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.780
 accentuate this filter or maybe of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.640
 change its strength and I can therefore 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 change these parameters 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 until I find what I like 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 me so I like to apply myself so here's 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720
 except this case decides to create one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.990
 copy so that my original 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.799
 always remains 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:32.259
 in the album except here I am so 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.409
 I take this picture and insert it 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.930
 directly the one I retouched the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.060
 I insert as magini fondo and now 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.759
 I take my beautiful Tommaso and to put it 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.810
 better to highlight a choice 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.220
 different 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.549
 in this case I saw a round bar 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.009
 I can enlarge my photo and how 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.940
 always simply making the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:06.000
 little hand with the mouse I can center the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.229
 photos as I want I can decide 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.030
 really even a bit to rotate it in 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.319
 this case by way of dynamicizing 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.900
 a little and give it an effect 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:26.350
 in this case it will simply be a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:31.030
 shadow but change its intensity here 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.640
 here then I choose between the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.380
 animations we see among those of the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 birthday 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.340
 one that can here is this one here is 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.340
 perfect 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.319
 it shrinks it a little otherwise 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.620
 huge and now I have nothing left 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.200
 nothing more to add 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.920
 maybe a label so I can 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:12.090
 maybe write a small text 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:18.269
 we see them here it follows that the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:22.319
 I put the size I need and that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.720
 what to insert the text here 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.099
 I write clearly more text in this 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.239
 case will simply be birthday 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.459
 what do I send to get one 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:44.659
 second head 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:44.659
 I insert the date on May 13, 2013 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.159
 and here to edit the text 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.480
 grain on text options and here I have 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.940
 thousand possibilities for example of 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.230
 to choose 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.799
 first change the font because 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.239
 visit something more childish then not 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.489
 I can modify the effect for example 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.629
 in this case if with it an effect 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.090
 extremely simple and I can't 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.400
 decide to reduce the text or in 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.639
 this case to magnify mine a little 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.639
 label 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.490
 so I do tests 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:31.840
 you're a little too told though how I can 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:34.870
 hurt you maybe do a little was 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.960
 equipped slightly can in pc here 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.960
 here yes 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.340
 ok it could go yes 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:54.150
 at this point I can choose to 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:59.900
 animate an element in the thymus mind 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.900
 with a confirmation trajectory 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.340
 and I add an effect too 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:13.080
 effect is that a little fluo 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:16.440
 let's see what happens ok cute the only one 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.960
 strange thing is the candle so now 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.389
 select a candle and I have an effect 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:32.009
 also she always this effect of 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:36.690
 light appearance no candle appears 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:40.080
 too early I change manually 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.259
 an absolute simplicity and I see mine again 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.469
 prayer 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:50.909
 here is already so perfect I can 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.360
 choose to customize this 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.870
 collage with music or animation 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.409
 magic in this case is fine with me 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.409
 so save 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.760
 rr I read my confirmation message 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.880
 I'm going in the photo library as always in 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.880
 michelon and my collapse chiccoso the 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:31.150
 my new animated college I did 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:33.389
 all I see then how to create a 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.389
 collage
