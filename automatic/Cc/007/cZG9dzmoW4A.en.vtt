on<00:03:05.260> some<00:03:05.470> pressure<00:03:05.680> then<00:03:06.340> he's<00:03:06.460> going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> be

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
on some pressure then he's going to be

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.610 
on some pressure then he's going to be
able<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.970> macro<00:03:07.360> up<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:08.080> game<00:03:08.350> looks

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
able to macro up and this game looks

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.500 
able to macro up and this game looks
like<00:03:08.860> it's<00:03:09.010> already<00:03:09.250> shifting<00:03:09.760> into<00:03:09.970> mid<00:03:10.210> game

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
like it's already shifting into mid game

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.120 
like it's already shifting into mid game
so<00:03:11.140> I'm<00:03:11.200> interested<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.650> see<00:03:11.800> what<00:03:11.950> both

every<00:03:31.480> pass<00:03:32.020> game<00:03:32.290> i've<00:03:32.440> watched<00:03:32.770> he's<00:03:33.070> really

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
every pass game i've watched he's really

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.340 
every pass game i've watched he's really
chosen<00:03:33.970> arbiters<00:03:34.510> as<00:03:34.690> his<00:03:34.840> path<00:03:35.110> he's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
chosen arbiters as his path he's

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.770 
chosen arbiters as his path he's
expanding<00:03:36.280> again<00:03:36.670> he's<00:03:37.209> expanded<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.750> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
expanding again he's expanded to the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.050 
expanding again he's expanded to the
three<00:03:38.140> o'clock<00:03:38.500> right<00:03:39.430> above<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> three

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
three o'clock right above the three

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.910 
three o'clock right above the three
o'clock<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.360> let's<00:03:40.510> say<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.750> 230<00:03:41.230> expansion

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
o'clock so let's say the 230 expansion

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.970 
o'clock so let's say the 230 expansion
so<00:03:42.459> he<00:03:42.670> already<00:03:43.030> has<00:03:43.269> his<00:03:43.300> main<00:03:43.750> his<00:03:44.200> natural

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
so he already has his main his natural

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.050 
so he already has his main his natural
and<00:03:45.250> three<00:03:45.910> more<00:03:46.330> Jane<00:03:47.110> be<00:03:47.290> playing<00:03:48.010> his<00:03:48.370> macro

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
and three more Jane be playing his macro

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.840 
and three more Jane be playing his macro
heavy<00:03:49.420> style<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.320> pretty<00:03:50.769> much<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.610> go<00:03:51.730> in

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
heavy style and pretty much you go in

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.520 
heavy style and pretty much you go in
late<00:03:52.060> game<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.450> hard<00:03:52.750> not<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.050> get<00:03:53.140> pwned<00:03:53.380> by

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
late game it's hard not to get pwned by

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.620 
late game it's hard not to get pwned by
him<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:53.920> light<00:03:54.519> might<00:03:54.970> be<00:03:55.150> making<00:03:55.300> a<00:03:55.510> mistake

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
him so light might be making a mistake

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.540 
him so light might be making a mistake
here<00:03:56.080> too<00:03:56.200> by<00:03:56.320> letting<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.830> just<00:03:57.130> simply<00:03:57.430> by

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
here too by letting this just simply by

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.979 
here too by letting this just simply by
letting<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:57.940> game<00:03:58.150> shift<00:03:58.450> in<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.660> late<00:03:58.810> game

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
letting this game shift in the late game

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.390 
letting this game shift in the late game
even<00:03:59.290> though<00:03:59.380> he's<00:03:59.500> not<00:03:59.680> playing<00:03:59.920> bad<00:04:00.160> he's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
even though he's not playing bad he's

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.550 
even though he's not playing bad he's
playing<00:04:00.640> really<00:04:00.880> good<00:04:01.030> right<00:04:01.330> now<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:01.720> far<00:04:01.959> it

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
playing really good right now so far it

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.600 
playing really good right now so far it
does<00:04:02.800> look<00:04:02.830> like<00:04:03.040> he's<00:04:03.220> going<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.430> try<00:04:03.580> to

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
does look like he's going to try to

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.009 
does look like he's going to try to
break<00:04:03.850> through<00:04:04.120> these<00:04:04.239> lurker<00:04:04.480> eggs<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:04.959> you

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
break through these lurker eggs and you

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.300 
break through these lurker eggs and you
might<00:04:05.170> be<00:04:05.290> moving<00:04:05.440> through<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.830> little<00:04:06.130> bit<00:04:06.220> but

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
might be moving through a little bit but

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.850 
might be moving through a little bit but
jangbi<00:04:06.640> gonna<00:04:07.600> struggle<00:04:08.080> with<00:04:08.440> these<00:04:08.620> arm

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
jangbi gonna struggle with these arm

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.890 
jangbi gonna struggle with these arm
kind<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.489> struggle<00:04:09.880> with<00:04:10.000> these<00:04:10.150> lurker<00:04:10.570> eggs

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
kind of struggle with these lurker eggs

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.840 
kind of struggle with these lurker eggs
here<00:04:11.200> just<00:04:11.440> because<00:04:11.560> they<00:04:12.040> take<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.489> long<00:04:12.640> to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
here just because they take so long to

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.850 
here just because they take so long to
kill<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.930> does<00:04:14.140> look<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:14.350> he<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:14.680> going

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860
