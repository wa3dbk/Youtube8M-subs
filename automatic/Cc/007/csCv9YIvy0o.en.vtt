00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.870
 Please, introduce yourself 

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:11.590
 Hi, I'm Conrad, then Mashkevich 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.090
 game director of the third witch 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.160
 how did you come up with the idea of playing with 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.080
 open world was it difficult to do 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.480
 development of such a project after games with 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.880
 open play in small locations 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.860
 the world has become our natural evolution 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.080
 series when we started work on 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.820
 the first witcher we also discussed the game 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.160
 open world because what 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.110
 setting gives you the freedom and the feeling that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.180
 you can do whatever you want in the game 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.130
 I believe that this is what creates 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.380
 real role-playing experience in lpg 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.360
 I remember how we talked about it when 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.920
 released the first witch but he was 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.260
 made on another engine which is not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.719
 allowed to embody an open world and after 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.090
 the second witch, we already knew that we were ready 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.370
 to this that we must prepare a new one 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.960
 the engine was not an easy task 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.540
 because we had many systems 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.610
 rewrite especially the download system 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.010
 because in the open world they cannot 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.930
 be it must be seamless and we 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.390
 understood that this is a real challenge 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.680
 especially regarding game history in 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.940
 the third witch we have very 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.190
 cinematic plot 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.229
 open world constantly you from the plot 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.690
 distract and we needed to do so 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.229
 so that the story captured the players to us 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.880
 succeeded 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.619
 we divided the world into three big ones 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.390
 territories in each territory 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.189
 own story unfolds 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 and you can pass them in convenient 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.490
 alright information from these plot 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.960
 components need to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.970
 advance the story of the game further 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.890
 Needless to say, every quest you do not 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.390
 sure but how will you be them 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.729
 pass and in what order which 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.400
 make decisions will affect long term 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.210
 run on game events 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.890
 the third witch should be 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.960
 technologically perfect game 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.210
 dynamic weather 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.520
 modern graphics and things like that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.659
 it was the most difficult to create these 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.490
 technology than you are most proud of 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.009
 In general, the most difficult in the technology of the game 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.079
 for us it became necessary to transfer them 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.490
 on a new generation console since 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.350
 this is a good device 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.750
 but not as powerful as modern 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.000
 so far and it has become a serious challenge for 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 our programmers fortunately us very 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 good specialists and you could see 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.440
 that the game looks great done 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.970
 great job and we are waiting for that moment 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 when can we show the witcher on 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.410
 consoles will the game take into account those 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.720
 the decisions we made in the second 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.330
 Witcher whether they will influence the plot yes 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.340
 in general, we created the plot in this way 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.100
 to be friendly to new players 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.740
 and the third witcher is detached 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.480
 stories but of course we remember the fans 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.220
 first two games and you can 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.960
 import save to new game 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.850
 what will affect quests 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.010
 based on past game play 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.660
 solutions for those who lost their 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.450
 save we have added the ability 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.090
 customize the game world as it is 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.400
 was in the finale of the second witcher in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.440
 the second witch was amazing quest about 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.320
 hangover is there a place for such 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.020
 humor in the new game will be found 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.600
 for me books ramana aja sapkovsky 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.370
 were full of humor funny stories in them 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.070
 there was a place for both the dark side and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.990
 for ridiculous the same thing in our games 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.390
 we need to add a humorous 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.820
 content because we know how the players 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.880
 it loves so you can count on 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.290
 similar quests in the game tell us about 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
 combat system and artificial 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.940
 intelligence opponents as much as he 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.390
 different from previous games in the first 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.340
 turn 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.160
 and and opponents are different in that 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.170
 your every opponent is unique to ours 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.540
 programmers managed to create a new yuri 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.340
 with fran for the system and and which is convenient in 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.230
 using designers they can 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.110
 create intelligence from visual blocks 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.340
 connecting them on your own 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.840
 each monster's behavior is done 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.030
 manually they are smart 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.190
 they have their own weak points and advantages 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.989
 so players need to be very 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.390
 neat in combat and gather information 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.580
 about each monster to prepare for 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.590
 battles on the presentation we showed 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.660
 werewolf who has the ability to 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.360
 regeneration he can go straight 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.340
 fight time and summon wolves if you 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.350
 there is a necessary kirovka you can 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.570
 disable monster abilities what 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.400
 noticeably facilitate the battle of force 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.200
 werewolf is also affected by the time of day 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.480
 if you attack him at night when 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.170
 full moon then you will be very hard with 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.300
 he can handle 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.340
 as for the combat system, we 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.170
 changed much in battles now 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.419
 the reaction was much better 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.580
 Communication before animation was pretty 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.770
 long now they are much faster and 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.720
 battles are built from a sequence 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.110
 short animations whenever 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.340
 you go dodge 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.979
 you can this sequence 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.379
 instantly interrupt the changes made and 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.599
 cameras in battle and target selection it became 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.849
 make it much easier to choose 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.680
 any adversary and no longer with this 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.569
 have problems apart from this there 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.139
 rich tactical variety 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.580
 counterattacks bombs crossbows and stuff that 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.009
 in your opinion do the third 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.319
 Witcher great game in my opinion 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.000
 the third witcher is wonderful 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.099
 deep plot combination 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.990
 great gameplay and open world 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.870
 which you can study for long hours 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.539
 I believe that all lpg should be 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.879
 so this is a new generation of role-playing games and 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.949
 I hope that everyone who plays our game 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.610
 will be pleased and will find something for themselves 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.979
 interesting 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.469
 most of all we are interested in well 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.629
 familiar from the books characters yennifer and 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.520
 Cyrill find out if we 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.310
 happened to them over the past in the first 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.680
 two games time yes you will meet 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.599
 Jennifer and Tsiri our new game 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.060
 tells about personal experiences and 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.159
 personal history of geralt and understandable that not 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.889
 maybe heralt without yennifer and tsiri 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.599
 everyone who read books knows this and so do you 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.490
 will meet in the game will take 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.500
 related decisions and together 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.139
 do some quests this will 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.240
 cool and in my opinion this is the best created 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.430
 us storyline those who played in 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.169
 the first 2 witches will be nice 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.529
 surprised and delighted with those things 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.169
 who are we going to show end whether 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:51.199
 this story of heralt is the end of the trilogy 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.750
 Witcher's number is huge and we still do not know 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.360
 What will you do then somehow we 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.370
 there is this franchise there is this world and us 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.990
 I would not want to leave him but we 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.180
 will need to take a pause to like 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.550
 it says to refresh your heads and a little 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.419
 take a break from heralt and I hope though 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.550
 it's not up to me 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.259
 the leaders make the decision but I 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.080
 I hope that this is not the last word on 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.939
 Geralt and his world on the Internet walks 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.949
 huge amount of information about the game 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.990
 if something we don't know yet 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.050
 have you saved any secrets 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.699
 you want to share with us 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.620
 Of course we have the secret but to 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.900
 Unfortunately, I can not spoil because 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.060
 that all this is important for the game information you 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.979
 find out after the release and you should expect 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.370
 from the game of surprises because of them there 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.530
 will be many 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.370
 the witcher has a huge army of fans
