so that's certainly something to look

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.740 
so that's certainly something to look
forward<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:25.729> also<00:04:26.729> something<00:04:27.389> more<00:04:27.960> here<00:04:28.470> it

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750

view the camera of participants so

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.840 
view the camera of participants so
that's<00:04:57.690> certainly<00:04:57.870> excited<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.490> if<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.699> don't

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
that's certainly excited so if you don't

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.189 
that's certainly excited so if you don't
really<00:05:00.000> want<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.300> take<00:05:00.419> part<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:00.750> pupae<00:05:01.050> but

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
really want to take part and pupae but

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.629 
really want to take part and pupae but
you<00:05:01.260> want<00:05:01.380> at<00:05:01.470> least<00:05:01.560> watch<00:05:01.860> e<00:05:01.889> or<00:05:02.160> at<00:05:02.340> least

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
you want at least watch e or at least

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.240 
you want at least watch e or at least

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
have that option but I guess that's

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.710 
have that option but I guess that's
pretty<00:05:05.430> much<00:05:05.580> everything<00:05:05.940> but<00:05:05.970> we<00:05:06.180> have<00:05:06.389> right

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720
