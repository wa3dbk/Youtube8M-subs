of<00:00:54.549> assisting<00:00:55.059> work<00:00:55.299> which<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.650> think<00:00:57.129> has<00:00:57.309> put

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
of assisting work which I think has put

of assisting work which I think has put
me<00:00:57.699> in<00:00:57.729> a<00:00:57.879> good<00:00:57.909> position<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.720> go<00:00:59.619> out<00:00:59.799> there

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
me in a good position to go out there

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.520 
me in a good position to go out there
and<00:01:00.159> create<00:01:00.369> opportunities<00:01:00.519> for<00:01:01.210> myself<00:01:01.869> a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
and create opportunities for myself a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.100 
and create opportunities for myself a
lot<00:01:02.890> of<00:01:03.010> this<00:01:03.159> industry<00:01:03.699> is<00:01:03.729> about<00:01:04.180> word<00:01:04.930> of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
lot of this industry is about word of

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.730 
lot of this industry is about word of
mouth<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.890> getting<00:01:06.250> your<00:01:06.490> product<00:01:07.000> out<00:01:07.240> there

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
mouth and getting your product out there

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.560 
mouth and getting your product out there
so<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.009> it<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> bit<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.759> hard<00:01:09.939> work<00:01:10.210> to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
so it is it is a bit of a hard work to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.749 
so it is it is a bit of a hard work to
do<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.960> but<00:01:11.200> that's<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.070> challenge<00:01:12.460> in<00:01:12.610> it

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
do that but that's the challenge in it

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.359 
do that but that's the challenge in it
and<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:12.970> enjoy<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.330> challenge<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:15.340> I

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
and I enjoy that challenge when I

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.100 
and I enjoy that challenge when I
started<00:01:15.520> assisting<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.659> was<00:01:16.780> about<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.020> year

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
started assisting it was about a year

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.560 
started assisting it was about a year
into<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.770> course<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.759> felt<00:01:19.060> confident

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
into the course and I felt confident

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.530 
into the course and I felt confident
enough<00:01:19.689> at<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.200> stage<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.770> take<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.189> step

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
enough at that stage to take that step

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.420 
enough at that stage to take that step
and<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:23.170> wasn't<00:01:23.500> as<00:01:23.590> difficult<00:01:23.770> as<00:01:24.220> what<00:01:24.400> I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
and it wasn't as difficult as what I

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.690 
and it wasn't as difficult as what I
thought<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.960> in<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.320> end<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.830> actually

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
thought in the in the end I actually

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.760 
thought in the in the end I actually
really<00:01:28.240> quite<00:01:28.480> enjoyed<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.050> first<00:01:29.200> times<00:01:29.530> I

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
really quite enjoyed the first times I
