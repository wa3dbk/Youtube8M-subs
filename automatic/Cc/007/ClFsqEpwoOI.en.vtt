00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I had to modify see I sliced the bottom

of<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> off<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:44.989> look<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:46.710> I'm

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
of it off there look right now I'm

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.260 
of it off there look right now I'm
cutting<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.180> notches<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:50.870> come<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:52.050> here

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270

notches<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.390> fit<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:55.140> over<00:00:55.170> top<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> bolt

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
notches will fit right over top the bolt

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.490 
notches will fit right over top the bolt
heads<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.320> I'll

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
heads we see here and here and then I'll

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
heads we see here and here and then I'll
just<00:00:59.000> this<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
just this would just go on there I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.500 
just this would just go on there I
welded<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> had<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> do

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
welded it around there now I had to do

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
welded it around there now I had to do
some<00:01:03.719> measuring<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.680> sure<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
some measuring make sure this was the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
some measuring make sure this was the
right<00:01:05.339> height<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.409> when<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> put<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.830> recoil

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
right height for when I put the recoil

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.020 
right height for when I put the recoil
part<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> recoil<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.610> barely

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
part on now the recoil just barely

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990 
part on now the recoil just barely
barely<00:01:12.720> covers<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.979> ended<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.760> actually

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
barely covers it so I ended up actually

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940 
barely covers it so I ended up actually
going<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.290> tack<00:01:16.680> weld

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
going around and just I just tack weld

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
going around and just I just tack weld
it<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.820> bolt<00:01:18.000> holes<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:20.360> had<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> measure

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it at the bolt holes I had to measure

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.789 
it at the bolt holes I had to measure
the<00:01:21.869> depth<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> side<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.799> from

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the depth of this to the side and from

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
the depth of this to the side and from
bottom<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> side<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.290> think

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
bottom of this to this side and I think

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
bottom of this to this side and I think
it<00:01:28.619> ended<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.920> being<00:01:29.130> two<00:01:29.369> point<00:01:29.880> four<00:01:30.299> seven

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it ended up being two point four seven

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.240 
it ended up being two point four seven
zero

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.610 

you<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.150> used<00:01:36.480> a<00:01:36.630> couple<00:01:37.050> Phillips

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
you see I just used a couple Phillips

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.670 
you see I just used a couple Phillips
screws<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> notches<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.140> way<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.470> still

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
screws and notches that way I can still

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
screws and notches that way I can still
pull<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> whole<00:01:41.100> thing<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.670> just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.860 
pull the whole thing off and just
transfer<00:01:42.510> it<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.780> new<00:01:42.960> motor<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.650> to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
transfer it to a new motor if I have to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.890 
transfer it to a new motor if I have to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
because once I when I weld this on it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.350 
because once I when I weld this on it
tends<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.100> make<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.550> bit<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> slag<00:02:21.150> on

the bottom of it and that sometimes
catches<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.330> rubs<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.170> could<00:02:25.380> just

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
catches and rubs or you could just

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.940 
catches and rubs or you could just
simply<00:02:26.010> pull<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> cover<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.989> clean<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.830> up

some I've had to do that too so pretty

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
some I've had to do that too so pretty
minor<00:02:32.040> clearance<00:02:32.459> issues<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:32.970> overall<00:02:33.300> you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
minor clearance issues so overall you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.070 
minor clearance issues so overall you
can<00:02:33.840> fix<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.380> pretty<00:02:34.620> easy<00:02:35.810> make<00:02:36.810> sure<00:02:37.050> I

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
can fix them pretty easy make sure I

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.640 
can fix them pretty easy make sure I
covered<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.410> this<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.470> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
covered that it on it this is a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.449

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
one but we're gonna go over to the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.160 
one but we're gonna go over to the
rainbow<00:02:46.530> boxers<00:02:46.950> rig<00:02:47.660> I'll<00:02:48.660> show<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.080> we

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
rainbow boxers rig I'll show you what we

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.289 
rainbow boxers rig I'll show you what we
got<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:49.799> here<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.940> didn't<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.209> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
got going here on here we didn't have to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.479 
got going here on here we didn't have to
put<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> hole<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.799> this<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
put a hole in the for this one but it is

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.100 
put a hole in the for this one but it is
touching<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.299> little<00:02:54.390> bit<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:54.959> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
touching a little bit so you can see the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.920 
touching a little bit so you can see the
paint's<00:02:55.380> wearing<00:02:55.650> off<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.360> he<00:02:57.600> may<00:02:57.720> end<00:02:57.900> up

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
paint's wearing off so he may end up

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.070 
paint's wearing off so he may end up
being<00:02:58.080> putting<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.530> hole<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.690> eventual

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
being putting a hole in it the eventual

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.509 
being putting a hole in it the eventual
idea<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:01.980> probably<00:03:02.070> gonna<00:03:02.340> put<00:03:02.489> a

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
idea on this one is probably gonna put a

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.940 
idea on this one is probably gonna put a
hood<00:03:02.670> scoop<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.709> figured<00:03:04.709> out<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.860> look

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
this up I don't know how well will work

a little bit of gas you got a full choke

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:30.840 
a little bit of gas you got a full choke
at<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.070> ignition<00:03:20.430> on

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.380 

there<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.970> go

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
there you go

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.330 
there you go
started<00:03:32.810> right<00:03:32.959> up<00:03:32.990> first<00:03:33.380> pool<00:03:33.680> um<00:03:34.010> this

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
started right up first pool um this

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.740

hasn't<00:03:34.610> been<00:03:34.640> started<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:35.150> probably<00:03:35.510> two<00:03:35.630> or

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
hasn't been started in probably two or

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.540 
hasn't been started in probably two or
three<00:03:35.900> days<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.220> see<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.400> works

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
three days so you can see it works

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.699 
three days so you can see it works
pretty<00:03:37.700> well<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:38.090> doesn't<00:03:38.450> pull<00:03:38.630> too<00:03:39.170> hard<00:03:39.200> it

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
pretty well it doesn't pull too hard it

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.559 
pretty well it doesn't pull too hard it
doesn't<00:03:40.010> have<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.130> lot<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.400> doesn't<00:03:41.300> have<00:03:41.420> any

doesn't have a lot of doesn't have any

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.120 
doesn't have a lot of doesn't have any
real<00:03:41.720> kickback<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:42.650> kind<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.860> hard<00:03:43.040> to

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
real kickback to it it's kind of hard to

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.059 
real kickback to it it's kind of hard to
pull<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:43.489> uh<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:43.989> did<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.080> one-handed<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.800> it

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
pull but uh I did it one-handed so it

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.890 
pull but uh I did it one-handed so it
works<00:03:46.280> out<00:03:46.370> pretty<00:03:46.430> nice<00:03:46.850> now<00:03:47.330> if<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.630> are

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
works out pretty nice now if we are

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.199 
works out pretty nice now if we are
