00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
for super bowl 2011 so I think it's a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.590 
for super bowl 2011 so I think it's a
pretty<00:02:49.730> even<00:02:49.910> bit<00:02:50.530> both<00:02:51.530> sides<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:53.300> I'm

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
pretty even bit both sides so I just I'm

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.660 
pretty even bit both sides so I just I'm
just<00:02:53.720> looking<00:02:54.530> forward<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.800> facing<00:02:55.040> them<00:02:55.310> it's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
just looking forward to facing them it's
