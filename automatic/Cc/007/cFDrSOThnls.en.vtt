00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:25.550
 and there are very good to all the kids and 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.789
 I'm here in gta 5 Well this time I 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.550
 I'm going to teach something handsome handsome if the bug 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.710
 how to make money I started what lasts 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.239
 because I do not know what will last and well what 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.300
 first thing we have to do is have 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.719
 a garage and a garage I buy this that 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.970
 is in this part of the map here since 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's coming hit me son of a bitch 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.660
 good now when I finish with this his 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.660
 normal I explain 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 please 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.960
 son of a bitch son of a bitch 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.140
 Okay, that 's the first thing that has to be 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.360
 to do is have a garage like this without 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.360
 dead ahead if not police will search 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.900
 and what we have to do is fill it 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.350
 of random cars if those that have 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 given equal 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 you see for example here I have four 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 same and now we are going to clone this of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.610
 here by the way but to forocoches that what 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.370
 I have there present 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.490
 the case is to fill in it 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.760
 the parking lot 10 with cars 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.100
 different 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.660
 but those cars do not have to be the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.010
 your because all those cars 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.290
 we are going to lose 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.800
 ok we have a lame star 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.320
 good 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.320
 and we get into another car 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.630
 and so on until we have a full 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 Once we have the courage full as 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 you can see here 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.330
 as it appeared to see someone there because 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.460
 once we have it full what 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.150
 we have to do is get this 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.619
 car that is the point that is bought here 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.619
 for those who do not know 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.680
 that being around here I think it's 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.620
 if this benefactor planted once 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.660
 let's have that car what we have to 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.150
 to do is to the saints custom and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.220
 modify it whole is worth it because this is 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.410
 the bug the first thing we have to do 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.709
 is to leave the garage we do not have here the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.100
 we leave it here and enter the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.100
 garage 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.880
 and once inside, the magic begins 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.530
 you see that there's a gap worth it 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.140
 let's move this car from here there 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.480
 how is it worth then we go to the end of the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.420
 garage 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.610
 here to shop our mechanic will 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.280
 we give it to her and we look for the hole 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.530
 of this which is the point is worth and once 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.110
 that we have the point gives double click and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.980
 what you have selected you are looking for the one 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:13.090
 wants to replace what is this here or 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.020
 we substitute and it's ok now 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.020
 we left the garage 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.580
 we leave the garage when he does not get the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.410
 win 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.510
 we take our car that was 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.510
 parked here very nice 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.590
 and we put it 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.500
 will tell you that it is full of faces to ok 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.920
 and now you have to select the one 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.130
 we have moved that is the point 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.890
 what is this down here 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.510
 You see we have put our car that passes 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.820
 that this empty hole remains 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.820
 so we take the car 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.560
 we went out 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.819
 and once outside we have to make a 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.269
 skid is not necessary and we go back to 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.269
 enter the garage 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.959
 for me what has happened to our car 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.959
 that was a fruit has become a 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.290
 clone of ours 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.440
 you see it 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.320
 it is worth now the same thing we take the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.440
 car 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.950
 we take it out 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.660
 we have full courage very important 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.660
 we go down we enter 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.810
 let's go again at the end of the fuck 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.070
 and we look again for the hole that is 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.340
 free 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.080
 what is this because we change it for 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.990
 other than those we have for 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.540
 example let's change him for the sultan 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.900
 we change it changes sides again 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.900
 we went out 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.210
 and once outside we will take again 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.210
 our car 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.300
 we are here 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.040
 we look for the car that we have moved that 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:39.150
 it's the sultan we replace 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.150
 we see the car 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.770
 we know 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.510
 with the return and we enter 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.240
 and so by magic 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.509
 we already have another you see who was and the 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.719
 tony sun is no longer there because it's that easy 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:05.090
 the book and every time we sell a car 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.550
 of these you can sell all but 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.419
 always remember to leave one to clone 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.030
 but once we sell them all there is 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.800
 to fill the fuck again with cars 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.220
 random or whatever you want 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.530
 and well it 's that easy and for everyone 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.060
 that you sell the minimum that I think it is 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:31.349
 180,000 has to be quite 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:35.250
 improved all this has is quite 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:38.520
 improved and they give you up to 220,000 and 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.800
 there are people who take out 280,000 and another 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.819
 thing every time you see you give one you have 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.009
 to wait 45 to 50 minutes to return 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:50.219
 to sell what I do is put a 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.400
 timer of a web and that's it 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:57.629
 easy he whistles to the computer and tells me 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.940
 come sell and I take and I'll sell and 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:02.610
 good nothing the game comments I'm going 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.099
 to upload enough videos about this 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.800
 I like a lot about everything 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.449
 environments we put together a few of the 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.479
 forumcoche scribes that we laugh 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.580
 quite and especially the robberies I have 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:18.719
 the last recorded robbery that I'll upload 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.620
 Well, not much will I try this week 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:23.229
 or the next 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.340
 tell you thank you for watching me and a 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:26.340
 greeting and see you later
