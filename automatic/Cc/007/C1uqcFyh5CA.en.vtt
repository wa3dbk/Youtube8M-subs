a teaspoon of baking soda and this is a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.529 
a teaspoon of baking soda and this is a
very<00:00:22.650> nice<00:00:22.920> container<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:24.350> you<00:00:25.350> can

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
very nice container because you can

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
very nice container because you can
flatten<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> top<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.529> you're<00:00:29.369> taking<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
flatten out the top as you're taking it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
flatten out the top as you're taking it
out<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.240> package<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:31.410> sure<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.800> put<00:00:31.980> it

out of the package be sure to put it
down<00:00:32.340> well<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:34.170> mixture<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
down well into your mixture there and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.760 
down well into your mixture there and
we'll<00:00:36.930> give<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:38.000> little<00:00:39.000> mix<00:00:39.559> at<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we'll give that a little mix at the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.340 
we'll give that a little mix at the
moment<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
moment but at first I want to get the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.150 
moment but at first I want to get the
sides<00:00:45.440> scrape<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:48.320> it's<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.500> continual

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
sides scrape down it's a continual

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
sides scrape down it's a continual
process<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.850> scraping<00:00:51.180> down<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> sides<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
process of scraping down the sides and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.979 
process of scraping down the sides and
scraping<00:00:53.309> some<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> mixture<00:00:54.480> off<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
scraping some of the mixture off the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.209 
scraping some of the mixture off the
beetle<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.920> dough<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
beetle but you can see how the dough is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.220 
beetle but you can see how the dough is
shaping<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.850> now

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.320 

and<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:05.610> cut<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.180> recipe<00:01:07.050> also<00:01:07.260> calls<00:01:07.470> for

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
and this cut this recipe also calls for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.770 
and this cut this recipe also calls for
baking<00:01:09.330> powder<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.730> teaspoon<00:01:11.730> of<00:01:12.600> baking

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
baking powder a teaspoon of baking

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.710 
baking powder a teaspoon of baking
powder<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.590> again<00:01:14.520> I've<00:01:14.790> got<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.530> nice<00:01:17.720> flat

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
powder and again I've got a nice flat

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.820 
powder and again I've got a nice flat
edge<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.430> scoop<00:01:20.910> in<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
edge so that I can scoop in and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
edge so that I can scoop in and
automatically<00:01:23.570> get<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.960> measurement

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
automatically get the right measurement

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.820 
automatically get the right measurement
I'm<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.670> stop<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> machine<00:01:27.560> because<00:01:28.560> as

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
I'm going to stop the machine because as

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.720 
I'm going to stop the machine because as
you<00:01:29.070> add<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.050> sure<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.500> gets

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
you add this I want to make sure it gets

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.470 
you add this I want to make sure it gets
into<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:33.560> body<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.070> mixture<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.760> doesn't

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
into the body of the mixture and doesn't

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.300 
into the body of the mixture and doesn't
go<00:01:36.600> flying<00:01:36.870> out<00:01:37.910> into<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.330> air<00:01:39.950> some<00:01:40.950> people

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
go flying out into the air some people

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
go flying out into the air some people
recommend<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.600> add<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:43.080> with<00:01:43.410> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
recommend that you add these with the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.480 
recommend that you add these with the
flour<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:45.360> prefer<00:01:46.230> to<00:01:46.260> add<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:46.740> beforehand

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
flour I prefer to add them beforehand

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.480 
flour I prefer to add them beforehand
because<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.840> they're<00:01:49.560> easier<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
because I think they're easier to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.630 
because I think they're easier to
incorporate<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.050> can<00:01:52.470> make<00:01:52.680> sure<00:01:53.010> that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
incorporate and you can make sure that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.740 
incorporate and you can make sure that
the<00:01:53.790> mixtures<00:01:54.300> actually<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.820> working<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the mixtures actually are working the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
the mixtures actually are working the
way<00:01:57.870> they<00:01:57.900> should<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.520> responsible

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
way they should be this is responsible

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.470 
way they should be this is responsible
for<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.510> cookie<00:02:00.840> rising<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.120> want<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.390> be

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
for the cookie rising so you want to be

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.890 
for the cookie rising so you want to be
sure<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.140> don't<00:02:04.290> lose<00:02:04.680> any<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.900> one

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
sure that you don't lose any of that one

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.550 
sure that you don't lose any of that one
teaspoon<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.040> in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.940> batter<00:02:09.200> will<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.380> turn

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
teaspoon it in the batter will just turn

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.990 
teaspoon it in the batter will just turn
that<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:11.010> on<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.990> let<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.140> mix<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:14.000> until

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that back on and let that mix in until

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.080 
that back on and let that mix in until
it's<00:02:15.180> thoroughly<00:02:15.450> blended
