00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
 of course 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.420
 human cherkos of this is the video of the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.340
 last basan 2014 project the boutique 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.650
 button is a great martone that yes 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.830
 plays on youtube and consists of reading 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.390
 the highest number of pages in a span 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.740
 quite limited in time 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.599
 the video was launched by the book 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.600
 American cuber and violin with the channel 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.520
 Official poster of the event here 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.290
 as usual I will explain the acmo in brief 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.750
 how it works in virtually seven 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.210
 days ie from 14 to 20 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.320
 I'll be reading a lot of stuff 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.690
 I decided to take advantage of this 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.460
 event because 1 david participate in me 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.379
 like to emulate it doing the same things that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.030
 he does because it's a great opportunity to 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.140
 read more books there are rules 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.210
 here it is not that I can simply 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.410
 read so many books and that's it now I will 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 I say what they must read 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.160
 determine more than books the first 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.289
 book is a book with images and 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.970
 for this category I chose this 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.650
 so book to the attack of the giants 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.270
 before the fall is taken from the work of 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.520
 misery radius but is the author in 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.920
 detail of this novel and reuse houses 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.470
 as you can see it is a normal novel 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.000
 but there are illustrations including 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.710
 this color and then there are others 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.570
 inside and decided to read this 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.190
 book in particular because I love tin 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.120
 with the giants and then taking advantage of the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.980
 fact that there are illustrations 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.750
 etc. I said to myself that I throw friends 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.610
 the second thing they read to me 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.410
 to do would be to start and finish one 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.670
 series and it is something difficult enough 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 but I chose a series that anyway 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.820
 has a fairly low number of pages 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.050
 because in this case it is little time 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.850
 I want to read so I don't feel like 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.350
 read very long series and therefore has 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.330
 chosen the urban fantasy trilogy of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.150
 holly black or the fairy of darkness 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.250
 there are around 660 pages in all 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.750
 it is not so demanding I have already read 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.220
 a little bit but I stop right for 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.020
 take advantage of reading during the book 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.240
 upset a third note to follow a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.780
 book that contains red in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.060
 cover 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.100
 in this case since it is allowed to 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.660
 double the challengers resulting from 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.120
 new the tac originati of for the fall 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.690
 because he knows how you see red in 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.670
 cover 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.170
 then we have a book that someone else 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.090
 has chosen for you in this case asked 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.129
 to David to choose a book from me 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
 my tv dared a little more than fifty books 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.370
 and in this case the chosen David lives there 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 noted of tolkien 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.550
 I will not read the notes of course 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.440
 not so much because not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.570
 have voice tremble because I want to first 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.310
 ligier apple tree normally being mine 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.930
 first time and then when i will make a ri 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.880
 photo notation protection reader 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.190
 all the secrets and all the curiosities about 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600
 this book then we have a book of 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.950
 kind that you said less this year 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.720
 the genus before i minus is i 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.210
 classics and in this case I chose a 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.500
 modern classic or nabokov lolita 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.850
 this is the cover that among other things me 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500
 like a casino because next by 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.180
 would be to read a book from this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.980
 would help a movie and read watch 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.900
 both in this case can 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.970
 double the fruit again again 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.560
 lolita so I will also watch the film not 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.450
 I know which there are two shares 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.740
 press about both of them I don't know 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.510
 here are the chosen titles 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.320
 initially but provisional of mine 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.080
 book to you but on 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.180
 I don't know exactly if I'll read them 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.010
 all how to go one thing if me 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.480
 bore on the way home hand 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.980
 these are the initial titles that me 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.780
 I will commit to follow in case of spending 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.310
 something wrong I can anyway 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.200
 change choose other titles that you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.700
 comply with the rules listed above 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.700
 so we have this again is true 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.040
 which are altogether 12 34 56 6 books per 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.810
 a total of pages does not represent 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 among other things, the last rule is that of 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.739
 read about 300 pages a day 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.840
 so if these should not be enough for me 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.580
 add other things that would also be 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.770
 for youtubers to do a kind of 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.450
 daily challenge that is to make a 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.610
 video a day with small challenges 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.320
 small games practically bound 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.000
 at the lowest book in new york don't do 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.590
 this kind of thing because the challenges 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.880
 therefore I really don't like them 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.050
 I will still make a video a day vi 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.120
 I'll explain how things are going 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.940
 how is reading going, etc. but 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.650
 totally in my own way without committing myself to 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.060
 follow someone's rules in this 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.470
 in case at least those will update you a 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.180
 moment maybe there will be games 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.800
 minutes to stupid things though anyway 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.209
 I'll see you once a day for 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.250
 that week so if you need 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.930
