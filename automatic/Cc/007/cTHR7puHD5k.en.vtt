so that's it's a good amount of models I
like<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.340> way<00:05:52.430> this<00:05:52.580> is<00:05:52.639> looking<00:05:52.849> now<00:05:53.510> we're

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
like the way this is looking now we're

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.540 
like the way this is looking now we're
playing<00:05:53.900> kill<00:05:54.110> points<00:05:54.440> pitch<00:05:54.830> battle<00:05:55.190> it's

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
playing kill points pitch battle it's

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.430 
playing kill points pitch battle it's
obviously<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.599> standard<00:05:57.020> game<00:05:57.229> if

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
obviously the the standard game if

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.110 
obviously the the standard game if
people<00:05:57.860> haven't<00:05:58.010> figured<00:05:58.310> out<00:05:58.340> yet<00:05:58.669> if

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
people haven't figured out yet if

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.640 
people haven't figured out yet if
they're<00:05:59.270> doing<00:05:59.419> a<00:05:59.449> Pilate<00:05:59.750> challenge<00:06:00.440> that

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
they're doing a Pilate challenge that

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.719 
they're doing a Pilate challenge that
that's<00:06:00.800> what<00:06:01.250> they're<00:06:01.400> getting<00:06:01.699> themselves

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
that's what they're getting themselves

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.939 
that's what they're getting themselves
into<00:06:02.240> so<00:06:02.510> for<00:06:02.690> all<00:06:02.720> players<00:06:02.960> who<00:06:03.260> wish<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.590> make

into so for all players who wish to make
list<00:06:04.190> beforehand<00:06:04.820> to<00:06:04.970> challenge<00:06:05.360> me<00:06:05.479> to<00:06:05.510> apply

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
list beforehand to challenge me to apply

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.360 
list beforehand to challenge me to apply
plate<00:06:06.110> they<00:06:06.650> know<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:06.889> they<00:06:07.010> can<00:06:07.039> make<00:06:07.190> a

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
plate they know that they can make a

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.460 
plate they know that they can make a
list<00:06:07.940> that<00:06:08.060> would<00:06:08.270> probably<00:06:08.449> be<00:06:08.750> good<00:06:08.780> for<00:06:09.260> a

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
list that would probably be good for a

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.290

take<00:06:19.629> a<00:06:19.659> look<00:06:19.840> at<00:06:19.960> deployment<00:06:20.409> I<00:06:20.469> want<00:06:20.620> to<00:06:20.680> roll

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
take a look at deployment I want to roll

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.709 
take a look at deployment I want to roll
off<00:06:20.889> for<00:06:21.069> deployment<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.610> for<00:06:21.819> terrain<00:06:22.180> we're

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
off for deployment and for terrain we're

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.110 
off for deployment and for terrain we're
old<00:06:22.840> die<00:06:23.080> each<00:06:23.379> five<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:24.310> a<00:06:24.340> three<00:06:24.490> came<00:06:24.759> up<00:06:24.969> a
