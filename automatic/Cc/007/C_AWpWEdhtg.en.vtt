really hard to do that alone took about

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
really hard to do that alone took about
two<00:00:35.820> hours<00:00:36.050> just<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> removable<00:00:37.739> helmet

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
so um I'm good you probably already know
what<00:00:42.149> figure<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> already<00:00:43.260> from<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> title

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
what figure it is already from the title

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.959 
what figure it is already from the title
but<00:00:44.700> um<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> figure<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> clone

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but um here is the figure it is clone

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
but um here is the figure it is clone

blue paint markers which are these paint
markers<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> ever<00:02:03.960> find<00:02:04.259> one<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
markers if you ever find one and in a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
markers if you ever find one and in a
store<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.509> recommend<00:02:06.930> picking<00:02:07.200> them<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.729> they

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
store I recommend picking them up they

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.910 
store I recommend picking them up they
kinda<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.239> look<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> open

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
kinda they look like this if you open

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
kinda they look like this if you open
them<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.220> look<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.000> that's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
them they look like that and that's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
them they look like that and that's
actually<00:02:12.870> pain

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
actually pain

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.750 
actually pain
see<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:17.160> will<00:02:17.370> come<00:02:17.580> off

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
see but and that that will come off

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.080 
see but and that that will come off
after<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:19.019> little<00:02:19.319> bit<00:02:19.500> see<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.610> already<00:02:20.819> like

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
after a little bit see it's already like

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.280 
after a little bit see it's already like
spreading<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.330> used<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.019> for<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
spreading but so I used that for the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.920 
spreading but so I used that for the
details<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:25.950> since<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.370> does<00:02:26.580> come<00:02:26.879> off<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.330> did

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
details but since it does come off I did

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.619 
details but since it does come off I did
take<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.379> can<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> spray<00:02:29.700> paint<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.060> full

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
take a can like a spray paint can full

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.830 
take a can like a spray paint can full
of<00:02:30.799> clear<00:02:31.799> gloss<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.970> sprayed<00:02:33.480> them<00:02:33.660> all

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
of clear gloss and I sprayed them all

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.809 
of clear gloss and I sprayed them all
with<00:02:33.989> clear<00:02:34.260> gloss<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.830> now<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.340> won't<00:02:35.549> come

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
with clear gloss and now it won't come

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.330 
with clear gloss and now it won't come
off<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.120> easily<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:37.680> clear<00:02:38.129> gloss

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
off as easily because clear gloss

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.780 
off as easily because clear gloss
protects<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.299> paint<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.519> be

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
protects the paint so on it can be

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.440 
protects the paint so on it can be
handled<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:43.640> yeah<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.849> was<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.269> was

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
handled more and yeah that was this was

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.440 
handled more and yeah that was this was
a<00:02:45.540> pretty<00:02:45.810> basic<00:02:46.079> trooper<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:47.040> wasn't<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
a pretty basic trooper it wasn't it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.470 
a pretty basic trooper it wasn't it
wasn't<00:02:48.660> as<00:02:49.049> hard<00:02:49.799> as<00:02:50.069> kicks<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.849> course<00:02:51.120> or

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
wasn't as hard as kicks of course or

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.900 
wasn't as hard as kicks of course or
even<00:02:51.630> boil<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:53.069> was<00:02:53.190> easier<00:02:53.519> than<00:02:53.700> both

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
even boil this one was easier than both

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.150 
even boil this one was easier than both
of<00:02:53.940> them<00:02:54.150> except<00:02:55.049> for<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.319> helmet<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.950> helmet

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
of them except for the helmet the helmet

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.819 
of them except for the helmet the helmet
is<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> only<00:02:56.700> exception<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:57.989> if<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.650> take

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
is the only exception so if you take

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.559 
is the only exception so if you take
away<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.129> helmet<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.849> was<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:00.540> easier

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
away the helmet this was much easier

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.940 
away the helmet this was much easier
than<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> two<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.060> helmet

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
than the two but if you have the helmet

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.190 
than the two but if you have the helmet
I'd<00:03:04.950> say<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.670> hardest<00:03:05.700> custom<00:03:06.599> that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
I'd say this is the hardest custom that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.330 
I'd say this is the hardest custom that
I've<00:03:07.319> done<00:03:08.900> because<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.110> took<00:03:10.319> two<00:03:10.799> hours<00:03:10.829> to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I've done because it took two hours to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.580 
I've done because it took two hours to
drill<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.849> helmet<00:03:12.060> out<00:03:12.299> without<00:03:13.110> breaking

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
drill this helmet out without breaking

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.780 
drill this helmet out without breaking
it<00:03:14.010> because<00:03:14.420> if<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.690> notice<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it because if you notice like on the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
it because if you notice like on the
inside

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
inside

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.979 
inside
you<00:03:19.590> well<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:21.120> kind<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.359> hard<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.630> tell<00:03:21.810> but

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
you well it's kind of hard to tell but

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.319 
you well it's kind of hard to tell but
on<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.560> cheek<00:03:22.859> part<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.700> trooper<00:03:24.120> and

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
on the cheek part of this trooper and

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.960 
on the cheek part of this trooper and
then<00:03:24.810> right<00:03:24.989> there<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> back<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.730> is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
then right there in the back that is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300 
then right there in the back that is
very<00:03:27.299> thin<00:03:27.720> plastic<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.620> could<00:03:29.069> just<00:03:29.280> be

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
very thin plastic and that could just be

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.720 
very thin plastic and that could just be
poked<00:03:29.700> out<00:03:29.940> really<00:03:30.690> easily<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.130> had<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.609> be

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
poked out really easily so I had to be

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.050 
poked out really easily so I had to be
very<00:03:32.760> careful<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:34.319> not<00:03:34.590> um<00:03:34.920> getting<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.819> hole

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
very careful with not um getting a hole

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.400 
very careful with not um getting a hole
in<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.359> helmet<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.590> um<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.970> would<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.720> this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
in this helmet but um this would be this

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.500 
in this helmet but um this would be this
is<00:03:40.500> my<00:03:40.620> newest<00:03:41.010> addition<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.579> 501st
