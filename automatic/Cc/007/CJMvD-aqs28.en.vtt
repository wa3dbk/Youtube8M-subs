00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.559
 make our celebrations special 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.929
 the fireworks of today are 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.580
 so technological that it's easy 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 forget that they are not an invention 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:28.859
 modern but what a pyrotechnic is for 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:30.660
 to create them assemble the explosives in the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.669
 fireworks is the job of the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 pyrotechnic, even the smallest 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.860
 spark of electricity could make them 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 explode then antistatic gloves are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.920
 a firework is mandatory 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.710
 consisting of separate compartments 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 placed inside a casing la 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 fuse blows up a compartment 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.510
 at a time creating explosions 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 staggered before the pyrotechnic glues the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.680
 main fuse on the bottom 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.020
 of the casing the glue is dyed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.140
 blue to understand exactly where it is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.140
 apply 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.060
 now puts the fund aside to work 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 on the second compartment of this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.870
 firework 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 start by pouring an explosive powder 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.350
 in the center 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 then cover it 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.600
 the next step is to apply 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.000
 a piece of brown cardboard for 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.979
 absorb the blow and fix this 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.380
 compartment from the explosion of the first 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.780
 then a cardboard disk is applied 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.030
 corrugated and a plastic spacer 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.340
 the fuse will take a second and a half 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.890
 to burn through these two pieces 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.590
 creating a slight delay between the first 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.539
 explosion the second paste this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 second compartment and complicated if it is 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.039
 too tight will suffocate the explosion 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.390
 but it must be close enough to 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.610
 endure late and time to prepare 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.980
 the first compartment the pyrotechnic 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.950
 takes a container which it then fills 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.900
 with hundreds of stars they are explosive 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.090
 carefully measured combined with agents 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.209
 dyes like magnesium for white 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.319
 the copper salts for the carbon blue of 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.319
 wood for orange 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.680
 the pyrotechnician must handle them with 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.960
 caution or they could explode then 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.190
 adds comets another type of 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.190
 explosive decoration 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.190
 now covers everything with the powder from 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.190
 shot 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.209
 already 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.240
 finally paste the two compartments 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.920
 filling the remaining space with the 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.920
 same combination of ingredients 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.970
 when the wrapper is full paste the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.160
 cover plus the balance is better the more 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.140
 this creates more pressure than the explosion 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.340
 it will be large and spectacular then envelop 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.900
 firework with kraft paper 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.090
 the label uses color codes 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.660
 international to indicate the measure 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.000
 of the casing the raising charge 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.690
 a bag of gunpowder with one 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.459
 long fuse goes to the base of the face 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.880
 this will send fire into heaven 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.880
 fireworks 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.640
 when the main fuse is lit. 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.100
 at the top it lights simultaneously with 32 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.470
 secondary the delaying fuse which 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.970
 place inside the casing 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.380
 through the compartments 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.730
 of the explosive and the long fuse that 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.730
 flows along the outside 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.880
 when the raising charge takes 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.860
 fire heat the gas increases 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.960
 inside the launch tube until 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.270
 they don't explode pushing the fire 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.590
 fireworks up to 300 meters high e 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.590
 now let's start the show
