 we are needing because this is not 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.980
 I would call them more at the beginning told me 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.610
 things that are used now from my table 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.660
 gifts this I do not know what because it 's like 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.000
 tell people that I'm inviting 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.130
 so you can give me something and says Maria 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 villar that yes it is much more besito 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.080
 a more comfortable icon for all people 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.630
 sure to be saying are where 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.220
 Come on, but it's nice what you want 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.080
 when I want inner'll get to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.840
 the best legal something that you like 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.209
 I do not know where the ring gets you 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.580
 put it in the left hand in the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.959
 ring finger here comes a vein that goes 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.570
 straight to the heart that romantic why 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.080
 well you know I did not know look then 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.930
 where is the groom at the entrance the groom 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.980
 you have to have your right hand free 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.830
 because many years ago brides 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.989
 they were stolen then what happened 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.420
 having I hope that rights are 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.280
 boyfriends had to have the right hand 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.739
 free because they finish their backs in case 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.159
 they wanted to rob the room 9 devil for 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.860
 his girlfriend on the right side then the 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.810
 link comes in and you have to be 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.640
 grab the left hand of your 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.110
 boyfriend and your boyfriend with the club in the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.400
 club in your hand so you do not go to 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.079
 see without water 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.079
 want to say I protest no longer says 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 do not 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.370
 but good demarcation and now to play 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:20.079
 because it is white in 1840 of the queen 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.269
 victory was the one that initiated the first 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.209
 then she put on the white dress 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.670
 which means purity then the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.079
 blaber dress you get or the veil has 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.849
 a lot of things in one of them is 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.590
 formerly it was believed that they kept you 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.440
 with the veil to ward off the bad guys 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.730
 spirits and do not bring bad luck to 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.549
 the couple 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.739
 another thing was many times good 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:50.750
 in antiquity the non-groom does not 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.700
 know to explain it then then 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.349
 it was like a way that the boyfriend does not 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.510
 knew the ros that spoke that the time 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.290
 who loved in the row that uncovered 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.290
 Magic 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.890
 a few programs supposedly 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.560
 has to have the girlfriend to me it makes me 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.380
 an exaggeration 3 but good 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.480
 the virgin for the virgin so that she 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.820
 ask sports one they kill him and model him 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.670
 a third one for red galleries but I 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.380
 I already believe that the one you already have for you 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.000
 is that there are some who want to save it 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.550
 of memory that makes as his do 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.520
 nothing does not appear do not go do not you 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.440
 in the opening I already have included in the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.800
 flowers because you weave it is a 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.410
 little bit prettier older is also 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.640
 lengthen the shit of plays or not because 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.100
 If the league the league just once you 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.350
 they put the league and the girlfriend had to 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.780
 run and all the guests were behind 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.350
 of the bride was currently already 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.050
 Hence the obvious quiet and takes it off and 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.699
 Do you throw it to children 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.729
 or something old what's new we throw this 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:13.449
 gives an approval is fidelity I hope in 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:16.330
 my dear whether we are there is this 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:20.080
 blue look if it's like the sign of 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:24.159
 fidelity then the old the new and what 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.470
 borrowed is the past that's the old and 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.650
 What's new is the future you're going to have and 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.469
 it is always said that they had to give something 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.669
 borrowed a couple that would have been 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:40.090
 very happy as an amulet is like 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.699
 godparents of mass and of tie and a couple 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.949
 that is very nice and because 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.620
 comes from the godparents formerly the 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.560
 boyfriend always went with the best friend since 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.740
 be that to steal the bride or what 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.300
 out then the companion was the 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.159
 Godfather and the name of the 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.090
 Godfather because it was always 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.569
 accompanied the good ones to the new 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.240
 accomplice 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.349
 that the kiss is the transmission of 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.349
 breath for you 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.860
 Now who comes first if you for something 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.000

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.000
