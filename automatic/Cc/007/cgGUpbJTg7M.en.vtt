spirit of corruption he starts with a
hundred<00:00:40.890> corruption<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> around<00:00:41.879> 74<00:00:42.420> million

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629

him he will heal up to the percentage of

and<00:00:58.260> start<00:00:58.770> fighting<00:00:59.010> again<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> kill

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and start fighting again so if you kill

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
and start fighting again so if you kill
20<00:01:01.020> corruption<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.800> him<00:01:01.980> he'll<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.579> at

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
20 corruption off of him he'll be at

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.140 
20 corruption off of him he'll be at
eighty<00:01:03.000> percent<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.570> he<00:01:03.660> comes<00:01:03.870> back<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.290> you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
eighty percent when he comes back at you

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.730 
eighty percent when he comes back at you
now<00:01:06.150> notice<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.630> said<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:07.049> every<00:01:07.080> ad<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
now notice I said for every ad you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
now notice I said for every ad you
manage<00:01:08.189> well<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.760> reduces<00:01:09.270> corruption<00:01:09.840> what

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
manage well you reduces corruption what

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.050 
manage well you reduces corruption what
I<00:01:10.650> mean<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.790> two

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I mean by that is that there are two

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
I mean by that is that there are two
types<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.510> ads<00:01:12.750> ones<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> DP<00:01:14.310> us<00:01:14.400> down

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
types of ads ones that you DP us down

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
types of ads ones that you DP us down
like<00:01:14.670> every<00:01:15.150> other<00:01:15.299> fight<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.590> ads

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
like every other fight but there are ads

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
like every other fight but there are ads
that<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.580> healers<00:01:17.970> heal<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that you have your healers heal up to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080 
that you have your healers heal up to
full<00:01:18.950> those<00:01:19.950> count<00:01:20.250> against<00:01:20.580> his<00:01:20.700> corruption

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
full those count against his corruption

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.630 
full those count against his corruption
to<00:01:21.560> we'll<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:22.680> back<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.040> transition

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to we'll get back to that transition

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
to we'll get back to that transition
phase<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> minute<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.840> let's<00:01:24.869> first<00:01:25.229> talk

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
phase in a minute but let's first talk

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.520 
phase in a minute but let's first talk
about<00:01:25.500> his<00:01:25.920> normal<00:01:26.250> phase<00:01:27.080> 2<00:01:28.080> tanks<00:01:28.409> are

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
about his normal phase 2 tanks are

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
about his normal phase 2 tanks are
probably<00:01:28.860> required<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.909> corrosive

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
probably required because of corrosive

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.440 
probably required because of corrosive
blast<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.590> does<00:01:31.799> 600<00:01:32.280> cash<00:01:32.460> addo<00:01:32.729> damage<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
blast it does 600 cash addo damage and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.210 
blast it does 600 cash addo damage and
gives<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> stacking<00:01:34.350> debuff<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.040> makes

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
gives you a stacking debuff that makes

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
gives you a stacking debuff that makes
you<00:01:35.340> take<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> hundred<00:01:35.939> percent<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.390> shadow

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you take a hundred percent more shadow

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
you take a hundred percent more shadow
damage<00:01:37.020> per<00:01:37.259> stack<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:38.729> note<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
damage per stack I will note that this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
damage per stack I will note that this
is<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> Conal<00:01:39.840> ability<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.770> both<00:01:40.979> tanks<00:01:41.250> are

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
stack that's bad so you at least want

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
stack that's bad so you at least want
the<00:01:45.840> tanks<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.350> separated<00:01:46.799> by<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.070> degree

depending on their spawn points I will
note<00:03:00.609> also<00:03:00.849> that<00:03:01.120> when<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.629> kill<00:03:01.840> off<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.109> sha

for a bit of damage this isn't too bad

for a bit of damage this isn't too bad
but<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.439> eat<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.680> damage<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.849> gain<00:03:10.000> a

at<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.959> same<00:04:08.169> time<00:04:08.470> which<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:09.459> why<00:04:09.609> it's<00:04:09.819> at

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
at the same time which is why it's at

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.699 
at the same time which is why it's at
least<00:04:10.120> important<00:04:10.659> to<00:04:10.780> slow<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.319> knock<00:04:11.470> back

back in we go

back in we go
back<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.919> normal<00:04:27.220> mode<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.669> like<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:28.000> said<00:04:28.240> the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
back to normal mode and like I said the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.150 
back to normal mode and like I said the
more<00:04:28.780> corruption<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.320> take<00:04:29.530> off<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.860> him<00:04:30.009> by

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
more corruption you take off of him by

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.189 
more corruption you take off of him by
killing<00:04:30.220> her<00:04:30.669> healing<00:04:30.940> adds<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.020> less

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
killing her healing adds the less

healthy starts the next phase with his

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.510 
healthy starts the next phase with his
abilities<00:04:35.289> don't<00:04:35.500> change<00:04:35.740> at<00:04:35.889> all<00:04:36.039> and<00:04:36.400> he

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
abilities don't change at all and he

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.060 
abilities don't change at all and he
just<00:04:36.759> does<00:04:36.970> everything<00:04:37.150> all<00:04:37.600> over<00:04:37.630> again<00:04:38.070> keep

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
just does everything all over again keep

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.560 
just does everything all over again keep
killing<00:04:39.460> him<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.789> cleansing<00:04:40.270> off<00:04:40.389> the

killing him and cleansing off the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.129 
killing him and cleansing off the
corruption<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.259> you'll<00:04:41.590> eventually<00:04:41.830> win

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
corruption and you'll eventually win

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.689 
corruption and you'll eventually win
strategy-wise<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.770> approach<00:04:45.009> we<00:04:45.220> took<00:04:45.400> was

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
strategy-wise the approach we took was

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.060 
strategy-wise the approach we took was
to<00:04:45.880> divide<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.300> raid<00:04:46.479> into<00:04:46.720> 25<00:04:47.470> man<00:04:47.710> groups

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
to divide the raid into 25 man groups

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.760 
to divide the raid into 25 man groups
and<00:04:48.310> just<00:04:48.639> each<00:04:48.820> take<00:04:49.090> aside<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:50.320> tanks<00:04:50.650> would

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
and just each take aside the tanks would

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.830 
and just each take aside the tanks would
tank<00:04:51.009> the<00:04:51.160> boss<00:04:51.310> up<00:04:51.580> front<00:04:51.880> here<00:04:52.120> pointing<00:04:52.660> out

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
tank the boss up front here pointing out
