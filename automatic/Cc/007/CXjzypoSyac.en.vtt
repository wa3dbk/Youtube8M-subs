00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
then having a shaky game we got a few

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.550 
then having a shaky game we got a few
goal<00:03:26.610> percentage<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.180> fifty<00:03:27.510> percent<00:03:27.959> but

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
goal percentage up to fifty percent but

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.590 
goal percentage up to fifty percent but
um<00:03:28.739> still<00:03:29.700> probably<00:03:29.970> need<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> little<00:03:30.269> bit<00:03:30.510> more

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
um still probably need a little bit more

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.030 
um still probably need a little bit more

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
it's now a 26-point game not only did we

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.960 
it's now a 26-point game not only did we
not<00:03:37.470> close<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.920> deficit<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.850> actually

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
not close to the deficit it's actually

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.210 
not close to the deficit it's actually
grown<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:39.750> more<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.049> I'm<00:03:40.140> still<00:03:40.769> struggling

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
grown some more and I'm still struggling

to knock down my open jumpers and the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.360 
to knock down my open jumpers and the
possibility<00:03:43.830> of<00:03:43.860> us<00:03:44.040> winning<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
possibility of us winning the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.979 
possibility of us winning the
championship<00:03:44.940> tonight<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.510> looking<00:03:45.959> very

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
championship tonight is looking very

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.610 
championship tonight is looking very
glim<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.040> less<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.930> can<00:03:49.080> do<00:03:49.200> things<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.530> that

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
glim and less we can do things like that

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.610 
glim and less we can do things like that
get<00:03:50.340> steals<00:03:50.820> throw<00:03:51.239> lobs<00:03:51.540> get<00:03:51.930> quick<00:03:52.200> buckets

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.620 
get steals throw lobs get quick buckets
in<00:03:52.739> transition<00:03:52.769> that's<00:03:53.519> what<00:03:53.760> we<00:03:53.910> need<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.480> we

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
in transition that's what we need but we

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.020 
in transition that's what we need but we
got<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.500> boards<00:03:56.160> whenever<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.790> Cavs

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
six like that's basically what the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.110 
six like that's basically what the
mindset<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:05.459> i<00:04:05.489> go<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> bench

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
mindset is right now i go to the bench

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.670 
mindset is right now i go to the bench
hoping<00:04:06.360> we<00:04:06.600> get<00:04:06.660> some<00:04:06.870> miracle<00:04:07.290> comeback<00:04:07.500> that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
hoping we get some miracle comeback that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.470 
hoping we get some miracle comeback that
doesn't<00:04:08.340> happen<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:08.700> close<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.000> deficit<00:04:09.360> by

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
doesn't happen we close the deficit by

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.970 
doesn't happen we close the deficit by
one<00:04:09.720> point<00:04:09.959> Matt<00:04:10.260> it's<00:04:10.410> not<00:04:10.530> gonna<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.799> much

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
one point Matt it's not gonna do much

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.160 
one point Matt it's not gonna do much
it's<00:04:11.610> basically<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:12.390> wait<00:04:12.540> until<00:04:12.630> Game<00:04:12.870> six

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
it's basically we wait until Game six

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.319 
it's basically we wait until Game six
because<00:04:13.500> right<00:04:14.040> now<00:04:14.070> we<00:04:14.220> got<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.519> backups<00:04:15.209> in

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
because right now we got the backups in

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.080 
because right now we got the backups in
against<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> Cavaliers<00:04:16.109> starters<00:04:16.950> down<00:04:17.340> like

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
against the Cavaliers starters down like

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.030 
against the Cavaliers starters down like
25<00:04:18.840> points<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.380> don't<00:04:19.590> think<00:04:19.650> that's<00:04:19.829> going<00:04:19.979> to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
25 points I don't think that's going to

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.350 
25 points I don't think that's going to
work<00:04:20.130> for<00:04:20.280> us<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.750> mean<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.820> might<00:04:23.820> not<00:04:24.030> still

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
work for us so I mean I might not still

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.940 
work for us so I mean I might not still
be<00:04:24.390> able<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.630> win<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.840> championship<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.680> my<00:04:25.770> home

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
be able to win a championship on my home

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.500 
be able to win a championship on my home
court

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
court

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.330 
court
the<00:04:26.630> same<00:04:26.780> time<00:04:26.960> we<00:04:27.080> might<00:04:27.350> if<00:04:27.650> there's<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.220> game

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
the same time we might if there's a game

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.070 
the same time we might if there's a game
