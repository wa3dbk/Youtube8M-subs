hey guys Austin Wilson here I've been
getting<00:00:03.149> some<00:00:03.300> comments<00:00:03.570> on<00:00:04.560> my<00:00:04.950> shoulder<00:00:05.400> rig

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
getting some comments on my shoulder rig

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.230 
getting some comments on my shoulder rig
DIY<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.259> built<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> offset<00:00:08.820> pieces

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
DIY that I built about the offset pieces

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.320 
DIY that I built about the offset pieces
from<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.690> $30<00:00:10.200> shoulder<00:00:11.070> support<00:00:11.330> being

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
from this $30 shoulder support being

from this $30 shoulder support being
prone<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.780> breakage<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> want<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.280> do

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
prone to breakage so what I want to do

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.730 
prone to breakage so what I want to do
is<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.610> want<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> test<00:00:15.059> how<00:00:15.389> much<00:00:15.570> weight<00:00:15.900> this

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
is I want to test how much weight this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160 
is I want to test how much weight this
little<00:00:17.460> unit<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.940> handle<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.570> see<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.869> far

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
little unit can handle to see how far

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.120 
little unit can handle to see how far
you<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.350> push<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.740> before<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.070> actually

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
you can push it before it actually

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.750 
you can push it before it actually
breaks<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.430> thing<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
breaks the very first thing that I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.410 
breaks the very first thing that I
noticed<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:25.880> got<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.060> thing<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
noticed when I got this thing in the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
noticed when I got this thing in the
mail<00:00:27.599> was<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:30.619> bolts<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:32.399> each<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
mail was that the bolts for each of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.459 
mail was that the bolts for each of
these<00:00:32.910> pieces<00:00:33.950> didn't<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.430> far<00:00:35.730> through

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
these pieces didn't go very far through

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
these pieces didn't go very far through
each<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> plates<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:38.670> may<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.850> stuck

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
each of the plates now they may be stuck

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.170 
each of the plates now they may be stuck
out<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> quarter<00:00:40.410> maybe<00:00:41.040> less<00:00:41.340> even<00:00:42.030> less

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
out about a quarter maybe less even less

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
out about a quarter maybe less even less
than<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> quarter<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> an<00:00:42.870> inch<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.260> far

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
than a quarter of an inch is how far

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.119 
than a quarter of an inch is how far
they<00:00:43.649> came<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:43.860> through<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> plastic<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:46.129> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
they came out through the plastic so the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.340 
they came out through the plastic so the
first<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.610> did<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.940> peeled<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.510> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
first thing I did was I peeled back this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
first thing I did was I peeled back this
rubber<00:00:50.989> stuff<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> can

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
rubber stuff was on there and as you can

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.049 
rubber stuff was on there and as you can
see<00:00:53.039> there's<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.579> nuts<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.920> each<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.969> these

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
see there's all nuts in each of these

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.869 
see there's all nuts in each of these
offset<00:00:57.539> pieces<00:01:01.280> don't<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> nut

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
offset pieces don't you see that nut

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
offset pieces don't you see that nut
right<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> nut<00:01:03.809> allows<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
right there but that nut allows you to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.940 
right there but that nut allows you to
adjust<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.280> distance<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.780> far<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
adjust the distance on how far that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.190 
adjust the distance on how far that
screw<00:01:08.520> comes<00:01:08.939> through<00:01:09.299> each<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> offset

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
screw comes through each of the offset

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.179 
screw comes through each of the offset
pieces<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:11.930> what<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> thought<00:01:13.200> first<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.830> was

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
pieces now what I thought first of was

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
pieces now what I thought first of was
that<00:01:14.369> maybe<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.150> screw<00:01:15.450> didn't<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.780> through

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that maybe the screw didn't go through

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.330 
that maybe the screw didn't go through
far<00:01:16.259> enough<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.130> it's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
far enough and that's where it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640 
far enough and that's where it's
breaking<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:18.259> there's<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.380> enough

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
breaking because there's not enough

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
breaking because there's not enough
screw<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.369> through<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> threads<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
screw going through the threads in the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.590 
screw going through the threads in the
offset<00:01:21.750> pieces<00:01:23.119> another<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
offset pieces another thing that I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.590 
offset pieces another thing that I
thought<00:01:24.810> might<00:01:25.409> happen<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:27.150> each<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
thought might happen is that each of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
thought might happen is that each of
these<00:01:27.689> offset<00:01:28.080> pieces<00:01:28.409> has<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> quarter

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
these offset pieces has about a quarter

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.560 
these offset pieces has about a quarter
inch<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.729> threading<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.509> I'm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
inch of threading in there so I'm

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.270 
inch of threading in there so I'm
assuming<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> bolt<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.950> inside

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
assuming there's a bolt actually inside

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240 
assuming there's a bolt actually inside
the<00:01:32.640> plastic<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> first<00:01:35.009> thing<00:01:35.159> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the plastic here so the first thing I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.660 
the plastic here so the first thing I
did<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.210> adjusted<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> nut<00:01:37.430> made<00:01:38.430> sure

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
did was I adjusted this nut made sure

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.990 
did was I adjusted this nut made sure
that<00:01:38.850> our<00:01:39.110> bolts<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> offset<00:01:41.610> pieces

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that our bolts or the to offset pieces

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
that our bolts or the to offset pieces
would<00:01:42.270> come<00:01:42.630> through<00:01:42.960> further<00:01:43.350> than<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
would come through further than a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.010 
would come through further than a
quarter<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.280> inch<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> adjusted<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
quarter of an inch so I adjusted this to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.780 
quarter of an inch so I adjusted this to
make<00:01:46.170> sure<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.500> each<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.920> threads

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.539 

comes<00:01:53.790> through<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> plastic<00:01:54.470> further<00:01:55.520> than<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
comes through the plastic further than a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.370 
comes through the plastic further than a
quarter<00:01:56.909> inch<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.780> we'll<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.079> more<00:01:58.649> contact

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
quarter inch so we'll have more contact

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.690 
quarter inch so we'll have more contact
with<00:02:01.380> each<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.829> offset<00:02:02.250> pieces

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.910 

so<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> entire<00:02:06.479> rig<00:02:06.750> set<00:02:07.650> up<00:02:07.770> with

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so we got the entire rig set up with

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
so we got the entire rig set up with
both<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> I'll<00:02:08.819> set<00:02:09.149> pieces<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.780> want

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
both the I'll set pieces because I want

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.440 
both the I'll set pieces because I want
to<00:02:09.989> find<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.229> how<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.649> stress<00:02:11.280> each<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
to find out how much stress each of

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
the end of this $30 shoulder rig now

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.200 
the end of this $30 shoulder rig now
that<00:05:38.770> was<00:05:38.949> after<00:05:39.099> I<00:05:39.280> adjusted<00:05:39.849> each<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.150> the

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
that was after I adjusted each of the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.460 
that was after I adjusted each of the
bolts<00:05:40.419> so<00:05:40.569> it<00:05:40.690> would<00:05:40.780> go<00:05:40.900> through<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:41.319> a<00:05:41.349> little

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
bolts so it would go through so a little

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.800 
bolts so it would go through so a little
bit<00:05:41.620> further<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.240> completely<00:05:43.240> go<00:05:43.449> all<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
bit further and completely go all the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.870 
bit further and completely go all the
way<00:05:43.840> through<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.169> threading<00:05:44.530> on<00:05:45.250> each<00:05:45.400> offset

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
way through the threading on each offset

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.480 
way through the threading on each offset
piece<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:47.410> there<00:05:47.530> you<00:05:47.590> have<00:05:47.650> it

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
piece so there you have it

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.159 
piece so there you have it
32<00:05:49.150> pound<00:05:49.419> weight<00:05:49.690> test<00:05:49.960> on<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:51.870> $30.00<00:05:52.870> solar

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
32 pound weight test on the $30.00 solar

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:01.050 
32 pound weight test on the $30.00 solar
support<00:05:56.669> so<00:05:59.130> look<00:06:00.130> it<00:06:00.250> over<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.490> don't<00:06:00.729> see<00:06:00.880> any

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
support so look it over I don't see any

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.749 
support so look it over I don't see any
sort<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.419> stress<00:06:02.380> fracturing<00:06:02.949> or<00:06:03.250> any<00:06:03.370> sort<00:06:03.669> of

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
sort of stress fracturing or any sort of

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.740 
sort of stress fracturing or any sort of
place<00:06:04.690> where<00:06:04.840> I<00:06:04.900> thought<00:06:05.139> it<00:06:05.229> might<00:06:05.380> break<00:06:05.590> so

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
place where I thought it might break so

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.820 
place where I thought it might break so
for<00:06:07.750> those<00:06:07.840> of<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.169> who<00:06:08.349> have<00:06:08.470> some<00:06:08.650> doubts

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
for those of you who have some doubts

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.159 
for those of you who have some doubts
about<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.190> $30.00<00:06:09.669> shoulder<00:06:10.000> rig<00:06:10.180> that<00:06:11.080> it

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
about the $30.00 shoulder rig that it

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.029 
about the $30.00 shoulder rig that it
wouldn't<00:06:11.349> be<00:06:13.349> sufficient<00:06:14.349> enough<00:06:14.380> you<00:06:14.949> know

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
wouldn't be sufficient enough you know

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.920 
wouldn't be sufficient enough you know
maybe<00:06:15.220> you<00:06:15.370> have<00:06:15.490> a<00:06:15.520> heavy<00:06:15.729> camera<00:06:16.000> put<00:06:16.900> on

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
maybe you have a heavy camera put on

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:39.760 
maybe you have a heavy camera put on
there<00:06:17.229> so<00:06:17.590> let's<00:06:17.830> try

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.860 

all<00:06:40.250> right<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:40.820> now<00:06:40.970> we<00:06:41.060> know<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.660> it<00:06:41.750> can

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
all right so now we know that it can

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.530 
all right so now we know that it can
handle<00:06:42.020> the<00:06:42.140> weight

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.070 

pretty<00:06:45.290> pretty<00:06:46.130> decent-size<00:06:46.580> camera<00:06:47.030> now<00:06:48.020> the

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
pretty pretty decent-size camera now the

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080 
pretty pretty decent-size camera now the
reason<00:06:48.500> why<00:06:48.650> I<00:06:49.040> wanted<00:06:49.520> to<00:06:49.640> show<00:06:49.820> you<00:06:49.850> guys

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
reason why I wanted to show you guys

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.580 
reason why I wanted to show you guys
this<00:06:50.300> was<00:06:50.540> because<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.810> really<00:06:51.200> like<00:06:51.380> these

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
this was because I really like these

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.060 
this was because I really like these
offset<00:06:52.010> pieces<00:06:52.540> between<00:06:53.680> both<00:06:54.680> of<00:06:54.980> the

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
offset pieces between both of the

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.350 
offset pieces between both of the
offsets<00:06:55.550> you<00:06:56.330> can<00:06:56.480> adjust<00:06:56.870> a<00:06:58.210> little<00:06:59.210> bit

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
offsets you can adjust a little bit

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.500 
offsets you can adjust a little bit
enough<00:06:59.900> to<00:07:00.380> bring<00:07:00.560> the<00:07:00.740> hyped<00:07:01.010> up<00:07:01.220> and<00:07:01.510> the

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
enough to bring the hyped up and the

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.890 
enough to bring the hyped up and the
camera<00:07:03.170> forward<00:07:04.100> or<00:07:05.090> side<00:07:05.330> to<00:07:05.420> side<00:07:05.450> so<00:07:05.810> you
