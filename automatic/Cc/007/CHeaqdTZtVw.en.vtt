me
and<00:02:06.810> several<00:02:07.140> times<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> row

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
and several times in a row

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.009 
and several times in a row
front<00:02:09.280> brakes<00:02:09.549> are<00:02:09.759> disks<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> rear

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.820 

and<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> cone<00:02:14.470> shift<00:02:14.880> which<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> bit

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and the cone shift which I was a bit

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.970 
and the cone shift which I was a bit
worried<00:02:17.830> about<00:02:18.090> before<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.240> bought<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.540> car

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
worried about before I bought the car

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.620 
worried about before I bought the car
it's<00:02:20.980> actually<00:02:21.220> quite<00:02:21.670> precise<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.420> it's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
it's actually quite precise and it's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.600 
it's actually quite precise and it's
possible<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> make<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.680> nice<00:02:23.890> clean<00:02:24.100> shifts

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
possible to make a nice clean shifts

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.640 
possible to make a nice clean shifts
and<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:26.150> think<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> column<00:02:26.810> shift<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.260> itself

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and I think the column shift in itself

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.339 
and I think the column shift in itself
actually

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
actually

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.360 
actually
sense<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.370> drama<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.569> history

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.800 

and<00:02:36.520> has<00:02:37.120> actually<00:02:37.420> become<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.180 

points<00:02:42.440> off<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> cop<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> most

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.770 

sai-san<00:02:48.090> you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.570 

as<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.020> said<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.380> not<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.590> fast<00:02:52.920> car<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.250> it's

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
as I said it's not a fast car but it's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:02.620 
as I said it's not a fast car but it's
not<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> slow

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.880

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.350 

it<00:03:06.890> feels<00:03:07.190> like<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.550> that's<00:03:08.060> all

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.600 

in<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.780> last<00:03:11.960> few<00:03:12.680> weeks<00:03:12.710> I've<00:03:13.160> driven<00:03:13.430> a

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
in the last few weeks I've driven a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.960 
in the last few weeks I've driven a
thousand<00:03:14.000> kilometers<00:03:14.510> in<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.810> park

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
thousand kilometers in this park

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.040 
thousand kilometers in this park
and<00:03:16.090> every<00:03:16.540> one<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.170> them<00:03:17.350> I've<00:03:17.530> enjoyed

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.710 

and<00:03:20.380> I'm<00:03:21.040> afraid<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.520> say

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.940 

it<00:03:25.260> makes<00:03:25.620> me<00:03:26.090> almost

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.940 

yes<00:03:35.160> nice<00:03:36.050> clean<00:03:37.050> shift<00:03:37.319> from

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.790 

it<00:03:42.489> makes<00:03:42.760> me<00:03:42.910> almost<00:03:43.239> have<00:03:43.870> been<00:03:44.110> said<00:03:44.470> that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
it makes me almost have been said that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.240 
it makes me almost have been said that
