here with a video that I think everybody
needs<00:00:08.660> so<00:00:10.070> bunching<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.309> sister<00:00:12.179> locks<00:00:12.360> what

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
needs so bunching and sister locks what

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.980 
needs so bunching and sister locks what
is<00:00:13.440> bunching<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.219> causes<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.210> how<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
is bunching what causes it and how the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.240 
is bunching what causes it and how the
hell<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> get<00:00:16.619> rid<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.859> it

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
hell do you get rid of it

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.779 
hell do you get rid of it
so<00:00:17.609> bunching<00:00:18.449> can<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.900> caused<00:00:19.199> by<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.189> few

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
so bunching can be caused by a few

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.840 
so bunching can be caused by a few
different<00:00:21.150> things<00:00:22.430> let's<00:00:23.430> break<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> down

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
different things let's break it down

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.750 
different things let's break it down
guys<00:00:24.470> bunching<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.099> caused<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:26.519> your

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
guys bunching can be caused when your

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.639 
guys bunching can be caused when your
locks<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.510> too<00:00:27.960> big<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.680> part<00:00:29.480> you<00:00:33.649> yams

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
locks are too big for the part you yams

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.970 
locks are too big for the part you yams
letting<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.100> sit<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.630> yeah

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
letting that sit in yeah

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
letting that sit in yeah
another<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.280> causes<00:00:38.760> bunching<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.809> if

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
another thing that causes bunching is if

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.680 
another thing that causes bunching is if
your<00:00:40.770> consultant<00:00:41.460> locked<00:00:42.030> ition<00:00:42.360> whatever

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
your consultant locked ition whatever

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959 
your consultant locked ition whatever
word<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:44.550> using<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
word you want to use is not using the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.600 
word you want to use is not using the
right<00:00:45.149> amount<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> tension<00:00:46.370> when<00:00:47.370> they're

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
right amount of tension when they're

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.420 
right amount of tension when they're
retightening<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.300> hair<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.010> they're<00:00:50.160> too

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
retightening your hair so if they're too

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.689 
retightening your hair so if they're too
loose<00:00:50.700> sometimes<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.809> too<00:00:52.020> tight<00:00:52.289> sometimes

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
loose sometimes or too tight sometimes

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.520 
loose sometimes or too tight sometimes
that<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.910> cause<00:00:54.090> bunching<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> another

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that can cause bunching and another

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
that can cause bunching and another
thing<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.770> causes<00:00:56.280> tension<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> kind

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
thing that causes tension which is kind

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
thing that causes tension which is kind
of<00:00:57.660> similar<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.079> tension<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.829> basically<00:00:59.730> poor

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
of similar to tension is basically poor

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.810 
of similar to tension is basically poor
technique<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:02.010> consultant<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.699> not

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
technique so if your consultant is not

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
technique so if your consultant is not
using<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.300> technique<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.049> lock<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
using the right technique to lock your

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.700 
using the right technique to lock your
hair<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.880> cause<00:01:06.090> munching<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
hair that can cause munching and that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
hair that can cause munching and that
sucks<00:01:08.330> bunching<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.380> guys<00:01:10.760> have<00:01:11.760> seen

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
sucks bunching if you guys have seen

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.399 
sucks bunching if you guys have seen
some<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:14.060> where<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.990> lock<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
some of it it's like where the lock of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
some of it it's like where the lock of
could<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.770> roped<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:17.970> point<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> then

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
could be roped in at one point and then

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
could be roped in at one point and then
at<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.930> point<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.439> gets<00:01:19.619> lumpy<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.820> not

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
at some point it gets lumpy and it's not

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
at some point it gets lumpy and it's not
attractive<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.229> uniform<00:01:22.740> with

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
attractive at all it's not uniform with

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.880 
attractive at all it's not uniform with
rest<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.400> locks<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:24.650> bunching<00:01:25.650> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
rest of your locks that's bunching I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.590 
rest of your locks that's bunching I
have<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:27.240> lot<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> bunching<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.500> my<00:01:29.070> locks

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
have had a lot of bunching in my locks

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.120 
have had a lot of bunching in my locks
some<00:01:30.600> people<00:01:30.900> don't<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.380> some<00:01:31.920> people

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
some people don't know some people

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730 
some people don't know some people
really<00:01:32.250> can't<00:01:32.549> tell<00:01:32.759> unless<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.360> showed<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really can't tell unless I showed you so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
really can't tell unless I showed you so
what<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> did<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.759> rid<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.570> actually

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
what I did to get rid of that I actually

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.100 
what I did to get rid of that I actually
just<00:01:37.409> cut<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:39.170> good

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
just cut it good

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.370 
just cut it good
one<00:01:41.770> day<00:01:42.010> I<00:01:42.040> was<00:01:42.370> just<00:01:42.550> set<00:01:42.820> up<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:44.020> took<00:01:44.080> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
one day I was just set up and I took the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.860 
one day I was just set up and I took the
scissors<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:45.070> my<00:01:45.220> ear<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:45.880> just<00:01:45.940> cut<00:01:46.450> all<00:01:46.690> the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
scissors to my ear and just cut all the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.660 
scissors to my ear and just cut all the
fat<00:01:47.020> ends<00:01:47.560> off<00:01:47.830> my<00:01:48.190> locs

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
fat ends off my locs

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.620 
fat ends off my locs
so<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.950> people<00:01:51.070> don't<00:01:51.430> require<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.240> request

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
so some people don't require the request

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.760 
so some people don't require the request
that<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.930> do<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.230> some<00:01:53.380> people<00:01:53.590> say<00:01:53.680> just

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
that you do that some people say just

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.800 
that you do that some people say just
leave<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.190> alone<00:01:54.220> but<00:01:54.880> for<00:01:55.090> me<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.300> wanted<00:01:55.690> my

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
leave it alone but for me I wanted my

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.500 
leave it alone but for me I wanted my
hair<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.050> be<00:01:56.170> more<00:01:56.320> uniformed<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.150> cut<00:01:58.480> it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
hair to be more uniformed so I cut it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.400 
hair to be more uniformed so I cut it
and<00:01:58.870> as<00:01:59.800> you<00:01:59.950> guys<00:02:00.070> can<00:02:00.280> see<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:01.930> had<00:02:02.140> it

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
and as you guys can see like I had it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.190 
and as you guys can see like I had it
looked<00:02:02.620> more<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.520> when<00:02:04.480> it<00:02:04.600> was<00:02:04.720> straight<00:02:05.050> it

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
looked more and when it was straight it

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.920 
looked more and when it was straight it
looked<00:02:05.410> uneven<00:02:06.070> but<00:02:06.520> when<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.850> worked<00:02:07.390> early<00:02:07.810> it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
looked uneven but when I worked early it

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.590 
looked uneven but when I worked early it
look<00:02:08.050> more<00:02:08.260> later<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.950> either<00:02:09.760> way<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.270> didn't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
look more later so either way I didn't
