women that don't want to gain the drops

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.600 
women that don't want to gain the drops
they<00:01:14.289> could<00:01:14.439> break<00:01:14.619> from<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.889> hood

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
they could break from the hood

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.120 
they could break from the hood
they<00:01:17.180> also<00:01:17.300> chance<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.720> sweep<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.710> sweep<00:01:18.980> is

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
they also chance to sweep the sweep is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.740 
they also chance to sweep the sweep is
now<00:01:19.280> following<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.790> natural<00:01:20.120> curvature<00:01:20.330> of

now following the natural curvature of
your<00:01:21.530> finger

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 

so<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.930> fingers<00:01:25.229> not<00:01:25.409> sliding<00:01:25.830> against<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
lever blade when you're shifting we also

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
lever blade when you're shifting we also
hit<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> housing<00:01:30.570> behind<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> bottle<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.100> the

effect the reasons also decrease is a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
effect the reasons also decrease is a

took<00:04:47.080> last<00:04:47.440> year's<00:04:47.770> chain<00:04:48.600> at<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.660> 5.9<00:04:50.260> width

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
took last year's chain at a 5.9 width

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.600 
took last year's chain at a 5.9 width
and<00:04:50.740> shaved<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.040> outside<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> 5.5<00:04:53.860> of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
and shaved the outside to a 5.5 of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.890 
and shaved the outside to a 5.5 of
course<00:04:55.000> that<00:04:55.210> would<00:04:55.330> compromise<00:04:55.630> the

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
course that would compromise the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.150 
course that would compromise the
strength<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.320> chain<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:56.920> they<00:04:57.010> use<00:04:57.130> a

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
strength of the chain so they use a

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.760 
strength of the chain so they use a
higher<00:04:57.430> quality<00:04:57.850> steel<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:59.470> made<00:04:59.680> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
higher quality steel and that made the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.720 
higher quality steel and that made the
chain<00:05:00.010> 20%<00:05:00.700> stronger<00:05:02.340> thing<00:05:03.340> about<00:05:03.550> this

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730
