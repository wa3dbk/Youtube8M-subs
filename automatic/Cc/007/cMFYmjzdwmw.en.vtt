00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
just actually this is probably one of my

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.759 
just actually this is probably one of my
favorite<00:00:23.220> packs<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.119> these<00:00:24.240> packs

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and it was just a very good idea of a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
and it was just a very good idea of a
pack<00:00:29.699> overall<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.840> I'm<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.109> i<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.529> saying<00:00:31.650> what

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
pack overall see I'm I i was saying what

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500 
pack overall see I'm I i was saying what
doing<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> bundle<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.700> don't<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
doing the bundle but I don't know it's a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.950 
doing the bundle but I don't know it's a
lot<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.960> that's<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.320> 72<00:00:34.739> bucks<00:00:34.950> worth<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
lot one that's like 72 bucks worth of

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
lot one that's like 72 bucks worth of
madden<00:00:36.960> cash<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> bundles<00:00:39.120> hopper

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
madden cash and the bundles hopper

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
madden cash and the bundles hopper
doesn't<00:00:39.629> really<00:00:39.780> appeal<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> me<00:00:40.260> final

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
doesn't really appeal to me final

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
doesn't really appeal to me final
edition<00:00:41.100> players<00:00:41.309> no<00:00:42.000> they're<00:00:42.149> okay<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.500> not

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
edition players no they're okay but not

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
edition players no they're okay but not
really<00:00:43.770> they're<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.670> everywhere<00:00:45.090> right

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
really they're kind of everywhere right

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.209 
really they're kind of everywhere right
now<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.050> they're<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.260> over<00:00:46.680> packs<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
now and all they're all over packs and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
now and all they're all over packs and
they're<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.000> worth<00:00:48.239> much<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> be

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
they're not really worth much to be

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
they're not really worth much to be
honest<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
honest so I really just don't think the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
honest so I really just don't think the
bundle<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> players<00:00:51.690> bundle<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> worth<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
bundle of the players bundle is worth it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.130 
bundle of the players bundle is worth it
just<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.129> bundle<00:00:53.460> topper<00:00:53.730> itself

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
just because of the bundle topper itself

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
just because of the bundle topper itself
at<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> same<00:00:55.410> time<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.180> 12<00:00:57.180> x<00:00:57.480> 12<00:00:58.079> x<00:00:58.170> yes<00:00:58.680> 7

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
at the same time it is 12 x 12 x yes 7

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
at the same time it is 12 x 12 x yes 7
ah<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.899> even<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.350> for
