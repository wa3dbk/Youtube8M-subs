00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
got the deal see all kind of stuff and I
remember<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.680> actually<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> DLCs<00:01:26.880> on

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
remember they actually put the DLCs on

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
remember they actually put the DLCs on
sale<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.509> fifty<00:01:28.020> percent<00:01:28.350> off<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
sale for like fifty percent off and I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
sale for like fifty percent off and I
figured<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.320> didn't<00:01:31.650> save<00:01:31.799> us

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
figured that it only it didn't save us

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.960 
figured that it only it didn't save us
anything<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> difference<00:01:32.759> between

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
anything like the difference between

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.780 
anything like the difference between
those<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.600> DLCs<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.950> i<00:01:34.979> paid<00:01:35.369> was

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
those two DLCs and what i paid was

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
those two DLCs and what i paid was
exactly<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> same<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> felt<00:01:37.350> somewhat

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
exactly the same so I felt somewhat

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.340 
exactly the same so I felt somewhat
robbed<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> sense<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.240> hey<00:01:39.840> dude<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
robbed in the sense that hey dude I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
robbed in the sense that hey dude I
don't<00:01:40.619> care<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.280> got<00:01:41.460> my<00:01:41.610> stuff<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> week

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
don't care if I got my stuff like a week

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.810 
don't care if I got my stuff like a week
earlier<00:01:42.930> than<00:01:43.020> everyone<00:01:43.470> else<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.979> still<00:01:44.790> got

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
earlier than everyone else I still got

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.020 
earlier than everyone else I still got
robbed<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.840> week<00:01:46.470> early<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.130> nothing<00:01:47.850> in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
robbed a week early is nothing in

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
robbed a week early is nothing in
compared<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> actually<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.259> kidding<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.770> at

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
compared to actually just kidding it at

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.460 
compared to actually just kidding it at
the<00:01:50.009> same<00:01:50.189> price<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.240> paying<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.750> paying

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the same price so I'm paying to paying

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.999 
the same price so I'm paying to paying
what<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.790> money<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.710> I'm<00:01:55.710> trying<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> think

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
what more money or I'm trying to think

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
what more money or I'm trying to think
about<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.820> paid<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.509> money<00:01:57.659> up

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
about the right way I paid more money up

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.530 
about the right way I paid more money up
front<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> could<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.180> week

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
front so that I could get it a week

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.350 
front so that I could get it a week
early<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.649> felt<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:01.950> cheated<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
early and I just felt really cheated is

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.940 
early and I just felt really cheated is
just<00:02:03.840> an<00:02:03.930> old<00:02:04.020> truthfulness<00:02:04.500> she's<00:02:04.680> really

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
just an old truthfulness she's really

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
just an old truthfulness she's really
cheated<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.030> felt<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.630> were<00:02:06.689> going

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
cheated and I felt that they were going

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
cheated and I felt that they were going
to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:07.170> thing<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.799> black<00:02:07.979> ops<00:02:08.129> do

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to do the same thing when black ops do

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
to do the same thing when black ops do
came<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.209> sense<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:09.599> was

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
came out in the sense that there was

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.180 
came out in the sense that there was
something<00:02:10.050> along<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> same<00:02:10.410> lines<00:02:10.590> which<00:02:11.069> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
something along the same lines which is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
something along the same lines which is
why<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> didn't<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> season<00:02:12.150> past<00:02:12.360> this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
