hi<00:00:06.649> guys<00:00:06.859> I'm<00:00:07.069> gonna<00:00:07.189> show<00:00:07.430> you<00:00:07.490> a<00:00:07.780> little

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
hi guys I'm gonna show you a little

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.900 
hi guys I'm gonna show you a little
trumpet<00:00:09.110> trick<00:00:09.469> that<00:00:09.950> sort<00:00:10.250> of<00:00:10.280> sounds<00:00:10.670> like<00:00:10.730> a

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
trumpet trick that sort of sounds like a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.870 
trumpet trick that sort of sounds like a
bird<00:00:11.179> or<00:00:11.480> something<00:00:11.630> like<00:00:12.080> that<00:00:12.790> sound<00:00:13.790> like

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
bird or something like that sound like

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.310 
bird or something like that sound like
this<00:00:19.180> alright<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:20.240> what<00:00:20.689> am<00:00:20.779> i<00:00:20.840> doing<00:00:21.140> what<00:00:21.260> am

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
this alright so what am i doing what am

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.800 
this alright so what am i doing what am
i<00:00:21.410> doing<00:00:21.619> when<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:21.830> do<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.189> well<00:00:22.760> I<00:00:23.060> guess<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
i doing when I do that well I guess the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.660 
i doing when I do that well I guess the
first<00:00:24.050> thing<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:24.769> should<00:00:24.980> start

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
first thing that you should start

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.189 
first thing that you should start
experimenting<00:00:26.090> with<00:00:26.449> because<00:00:26.779> it<00:00:26.869> really<00:00:27.109> is

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
experimenting with because it really is

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.240 
experimenting with because it really is
one<00:00:27.320> of<00:00:27.380> those<00:00:27.439> things<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.740> experiment<00:00:28.160> with

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
one of those things to experiment with

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.859 
one of those things to experiment with
his<00:00:28.400> half<00:00:28.640> valving<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.179> technique<00:00:29.630> of

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
his half valving the technique of

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.700 
his half valving the technique of
pushing<00:00:30.590> valve<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.340> valves<00:00:31.730> down<00:00:32.110> or<00:00:33.110> halfway

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
pushing valve the valves down or halfway

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.259 
pushing valve the valves down or halfway
or<00:00:33.890> not<00:00:34.070> not<00:00:34.309> fully<00:00:34.549> down<00:00:34.790> that's<00:00:35.059> when<00:00:35.180> you

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
or not not fully down that's when you

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.490 
or not not fully down that's when you
get<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:35.570> close<00:00:37.809> there<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:38.870> can<00:00:39.019> move<00:00:39.229> these

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
get that close there you can move these

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.259 
get that close there you can move these
you<00:00:39.920> move<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.220> valves<00:00:40.519> around<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:41.120> get

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
you move the valves around to get

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.570 
you move the valves around to get
different<00:00:41.540> sort<00:00:42.320> of<00:00:42.409> harmonics<00:00:43.220> coming<00:00:43.489> out

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
different sort of harmonics coming out

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.640 
different sort of harmonics coming out
of<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.729> trumpet<00:00:44.080> if<00:00:45.080> you<00:00:45.199> put<00:00:45.440> them<00:00:45.530> at

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
of the trumpet if you put them at

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:57.970 
of the trumpet if you put them at
different<00:00:45.799> heights

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.990 

moving<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.220> and<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.760> slowly

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
moving them up and down too slowly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.370 
moving them up and down too slowly
they're<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.780> different<00:01:00.960> ones<00:01:01.140> as

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
they're just you get different ones as

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.009 
they're just you get different ones as
you<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.830> that's<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.610> take<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.510> pivot

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you go so that's going to take a pivot

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
you go so that's going to take a pivot
of<00:01:04.170> experimentation<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.010> your<00:01:05.220> behalf<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of experimentation on your behalf to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.170 
of experimentation on your behalf to
work<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.640> where<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.940> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
work out what kind of where you like to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
work out what kind of where you like to
push<00:01:09.510> them<00:01:09.690> down<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.800> push

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
push them down to what kind of I push

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.440 
push them down to what kind of I push
them<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> they're<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
them down so that they're about a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
them down so that they're about a
centimeter<00:01:13.020> above<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.430> should<00:01:14.670> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
centimeter above where they should be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
centimeter above where they should be
for<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.600> particular<00:01:16.820> sound<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
for this particular sound and then to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
for this particular sound and then to
get<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> actual<00:01:20.250> pitch<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.630> bird<00:01:22.440> call<00:01:23.369> or

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
get the actual pitch of the bird call or

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.389 
get the actual pitch of the bird call or
whatever<00:01:24.450> you'd<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.810> call<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.399> basically

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
whatever you'd like to call it basically

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.580 
whatever you'd like to call it basically
we're<00:01:26.640> pitching<00:01:26.820> around<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.479> f-sharp<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
we're pitching around the f-sharp on the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.889 
we're pitching around the f-sharp on the
trumpet<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.580> going<00:01:32.580> up<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.850> bout<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> B<00:01:34.399> and

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
trumpet and going up to a bout of B and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.330 
trumpet and going up to a bout of B and
but<00:01:36.899> I'm<00:01:37.020> using<00:01:37.229> these<00:01:37.440> two<00:01:37.500> valves<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.190> don't

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but I'm using these two valves and don't

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.639 
but I'm using these two valves and don't
ask<00:01:38.460> me<00:01:38.640> why<00:01:38.940> I<00:01:39.300> comes<00:01:40.080> out<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.289> those<00:01:40.410> pitch

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
ask me why I comes out at those pitch

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:41.840 
ask me why I comes out at those pitch
because<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> valves<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because that's not the valves that you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.070 
because that's not the valves that you
push<00:01:42.000> down<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.270> those<00:01:42.450> notes<00:01:42.660> but<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
push down here those notes but I'm just

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.730 
push down here those notes but I'm just
giving<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> idea<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.369> pigeon<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> yeah

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
giving you idea where my pigeon so yeah

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.090 
giving you idea where my pigeon so yeah
that's<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.780> insight<00:01:55.110> into<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.679> kind

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that's a little insight into that kind

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.260 
that's a little insight into that kind
of<00:01:56.130> trick<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.580> can<00:01:56.700> show<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:56.970> friends

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of trick that you can show your friends

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.140 
of trick that you can show your friends
if<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:58.020> enjoy
