00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
taste right and yeah sure enough there's

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.839 
taste right and yeah sure enough there's
ants<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.790> too<00:02:49.099> at<00:02:50.099> first<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.640> mean<00:02:50.790> I

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
ants and that too at first I mean I

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.339 
ants and that too at first I mean I
tried<00:02:51.090> smashing<00:02:51.420> them<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.049> little<00:02:52.140> while

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
tried smashing them for a little while

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.729 
tried smashing them for a little while
like<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.860> by<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.959> was<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.110> lot<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.410> fun

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
like one by one but it was a lot of fun

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.410 
like one by one but it was a lot of fun
but<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.099> don't<00:02:56.220> think<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:56.700> got<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.299> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
but I don't think it really got to the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.039 
but I don't think it really got to the
source<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.110> problem<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> got<00:03:00.720> some<00:03:00.930> of

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
source of the problem so I got some of

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.610 
source of the problem so I got some of
this<00:03:01.140> ant<00:03:01.530> poison<00:03:02.069> stuff<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.690> kind<00:03:04.560> of

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
this ant poison stuff and it's kind of

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
this ant poison stuff and it's kind of
sneaky<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.160> know<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.879> kind<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:06.299> cheating

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
sneaky I know it's kind of like cheating

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.930 
sneaky I know it's kind of like cheating
but<00:03:06.930> there's<00:03:07.160> there's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.250> million<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.760> them

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
but there's there's a million of them

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.520 
but there's there's a million of them
and<00:03:09.209> there's<00:03:09.329> just<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> me<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.200> figure<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and there's just one of me so I figure I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.750 
and there's just one of me so I figure I
i<00:03:11.030> can<00:03:12.030> use<00:03:12.150> poison<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.720> i<00:03:12.840> want<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
i can use poison if i want to so the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.420 
i can use poison if i want to so the
idea<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.359> they<00:03:15.900> go<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.410> there<00:03:16.709> into<00:03:17.340> this

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
idea is that they go in there into this

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.530 
idea is that they go in there into this
little<00:03:17.700> ant<00:03:18.450> restaurant<00:03:19.230> looking<00:03:19.590> thing<00:03:19.859> and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
little ant restaurant looking thing and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.270 
little ant restaurant looking thing and
get<00:03:21.540> some<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> poison<00:03:22.380> food<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.100> then

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
get some of the poison food and then

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.750 
get some of the poison food and then
bring<00:03:23.639> it<00:03:23.760> back<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.450> colony<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.609> share<00:03:26.609> it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
bring it back to the colony and share it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.729 
bring it back to the colony and share it
with<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.209> Queen<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.989> share<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.620> all

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
with the Queen and share some with all

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.089 
with the Queen and share some with all
their<00:03:28.920> other<00:03:29.040> friends<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.680> turns<00:03:31.859> out

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
their other friends but as it turns out

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.970 
their other friends but as it turns out
i<00:03:32.160> think<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.549> ants<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:33.030> my<00:03:33.060> apartment<00:03:33.780> are

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
i think the ants in my apartment are

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.430 
i think the ants in my apartment are
really<00:03:34.980> greedy<00:03:35.310> or<00:03:35.459> gluttonous<00:03:36.269> because<00:03:37.230> they

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
really greedy or gluttonous because they

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.409 
really greedy or gluttonous because they
just<00:03:37.590> show<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.669> they<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:38.970> eat<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> whole

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
just show up and they just eat a whole

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.780 
just show up and they just eat a whole
bunch<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.440> poison<00:03:40.829> food<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.340> die

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
bunch of the the poison food and die

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.479 
bunch of the the poison food and die
right<00:03:42.569> there<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.380> middle<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:44.099> all<00:03:44.310> the
