be<00:01:51.509> pissed<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.979> poor

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
be pissed I just think about that poor

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.310 
be pissed I just think about that poor
child<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> traumatic<00:01:54.299> situation<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
child what a traumatic situation that

they<00:01:57.630> should<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.899> thought<00:01:58.320> schools<00:01:58.740> were

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
they should I thought schools were

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
they should I thought schools were
better<00:01:59.670> equipped<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.180> handle<00:02:00.390> these<00:02:00.689> sort<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
better equipped to handle these sort of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
better equipped to handle these sort of
situations<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.860> Logan<00:02:02.250> said<00:02:02.430> bringing<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
situations like Logan said bringing in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.510 
situations like Logan said bringing in
the<00:02:02.939> counselor<00:02:03.540> or<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.500> course<00:02:04.890> calling<00:02:05.399> the

like<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:13.360> said<00:02:13.600> Logan<00:02:13.960> on<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.380> many<00:02:14.530> levels

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
like you said Logan on so many levels

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.010 
like you said Logan on so many levels
and<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.700> myself<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.300> situation<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.990> far

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
and for myself in the situation as far

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.540 
and for myself in the situation as far
as<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> tantrum<00:02:17.770> I'm<00:02:17.890> sort<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.160> like<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.460> the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
as the tantrum I'm sort of like in the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.060 
as the tantrum I'm sort of like in the
beginning<00:02:18.780> whenever<00:02:19.780> she<00:02:20.200> would<00:02:20.440> sort<00:02:20.890> of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
beginning whenever she would sort of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.510 
beginning whenever she would sort of
test<00:02:21.880> her<00:02:22.210> boundaries<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:23.050> public<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.740> would<00:02:24.280> do

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
test her boundaries in public I would do

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.760 
test her boundaries in public I would do
I<00:02:24.880> would<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.240> timeouts<00:02:25.720> even<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.200> public<00:02:26.350> or<00:02:26.740> I

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
I would do timeouts even in public or I

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.730 
I would do timeouts even in public or I
would<00:02:26.980> remove<00:02:27.370> her<00:02:27.670> from<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> situation

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
would remove her from the situation

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.170 
would remove her from the situation
completely<00:02:29.740> but<00:02:30.310> now<00:02:30.430> we<00:02:30.490> don't<00:02:30.730> really<00:02:30.910> have

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
completely but now we don't really have

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.330 
completely but now we don't really have
to<00:02:31.360> worry<00:02:31.660> about<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.680> much<00:02:32.860> but<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.160> have

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to worry about that so much but I have

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.040 
to worry about that so much but I have
another<00:02:33.550> little<00:02:33.760> little<00:02:34.540> one<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.840> way

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
another little little one on the way

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.930 
another little little one on the way
who's<00:02:35.500> coming<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:36.070> I'm<00:02:36.340> sure<00:02:36.520> we'll<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
who's coming up I'm sure we'll have to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.240 
who's coming up I'm sure we'll have to
deal<00:02:37.120> with<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.560> I'll<00:02:38.800> probably<00:02:38.980> do

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
deal with that so so I'll probably do

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.650 
deal with that so so I'll probably do
the<00:02:39.370> same<00:02:39.400> thing<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:39.850> remove<00:02:40.390> them<00:02:40.570> from

the same thing just remove them from
that<00:02:40.870> situation<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.620> knowing<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.040> that's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
that situation and knowing that that's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.370 
that situation and knowing that that's
not<00:02:42.460> okay<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.690> know<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:43.930> want<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.230> treat
