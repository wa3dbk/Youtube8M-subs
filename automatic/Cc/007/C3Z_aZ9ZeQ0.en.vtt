just slightly down from what a lot of

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.540 
just slightly down from what a lot of
crank<00:01:02.289> baits<00:01:02.530> are<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.739> lot<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:02.949> crank<00:01:03.159> baits<00:01:03.370> are

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
crank baits are a lot of crank baits are

crank baits are a lot of crank baits are
up<00:01:03.999> flat<00:01:04.330> causes<00:01:05.260> them<00:01:05.380> when<00:01:05.530> they<00:01:05.620> hit<00:01:05.740> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
up flat causes them when they hit the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.800 
up flat causes them when they hit the
bottom<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.370> kick<00:01:06.670> out<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.120> side<00:01:07.330> real<00:01:07.630> bad

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
bottom to kick out to the side real bad

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.270 
bottom to kick out to the side real bad
and<00:01:08.110> then<00:01:08.230> takes<00:01:08.500> them<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.680> while<00:01:08.710> before<00:01:09.070> they

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
and then takes them a while before they

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.160 
and then takes them a while before they
start<00:01:09.490> tracking<00:01:09.880> again<00:01:09.970> this<00:01:10.750> bait<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.020> a

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
start tracking again this bait is a

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.170 
start tracking again this bait is a
little<00:01:11.470> bit<00:01:11.560> different<00:01:11.980> it<00:01:12.490> hits<00:01:12.730> the<00:01:12.850> bottom

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
little bit different it hits the bottom

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.970 
little bit different it hits the bottom
and<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.780> tracks<00:01:14.050> straight<00:01:14.410> across<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.950> bottom

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
and it tracks straight across the bottom

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.270 
and it tracks straight across the bottom
I<00:01:15.670> mean<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.300> hits<00:01:16.510> cover<00:01:16.810> bounces<00:01:17.650> come<00:01:17.860> tracks

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
I mean it hits cover bounces come tracks

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.590 
I mean it hits cover bounces come tracks
straight<00:01:18.520> back<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.030> you're<00:01:19.180> not<00:01:19.240> going<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.480> get
