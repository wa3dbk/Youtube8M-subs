this was brought about on a question of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
this was brought about on a question of
how<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> had<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.920> wired<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.670> apparently<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.360> have

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
how I had it wired not apparently I have

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.359 
how I had it wired not apparently I have
it<00:01:07.320> wired<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:09.720> set<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> positive<00:01:11.220> one

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it wired that one set of a positive one

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.950 
it wired that one set of a positive one
set<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> negative<00:01:12.590> goes<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.790> sub<00:01:15.060> goes

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
set of a negative goes to one sub goes

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.060 
set of a negative goes to one sub goes
to<00:01:16.140> another<00:01:16.640> creating<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:18.080> one<00:01:19.080> ohm<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to another creating my one ohm and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.289 
to another creating my one ohm and
another<00:01:20.610> set<00:01:20.990> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> rear<00:01:22.500> subs

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
another set going to the rear subs

creating<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.450> ohm<00:01:24.920> even<00:01:25.920> me<00:01:26.009> half<00:01:26.220> ohm<00:01:27.409> now<00:01:29.180> if

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
creating one ohm even me half ohm now if

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
creating one ohm even me half ohm now if
you<00:01:30.270> look<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> book<00:01:30.720> though<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:32.369> shows<00:01:32.850> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
going to one sub both of them and that's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.670 
going to one sub both of them and that's
how<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.619> had<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.280> friend<00:01:39.030> question<00:01:39.390> me<00:01:39.590> should<00:01:40.590> I
