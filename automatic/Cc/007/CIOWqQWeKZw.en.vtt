00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.770 
this little ab circuit they call it and
you<00:02:07.130> pretty<00:02:07.369> much<00:02:07.490> go<00:02:07.910> around<00:02:08.179> oh<00:02:08.509> if<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:08.690> can

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
you pretty much go around oh if you can

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.440 
you pretty much go around oh if you can
see<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.989> sign<00:02:09.229> down<00:02:09.470> there<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:09.860> says

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
see the sign down there it says

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.259 
see the sign down there it says
12-minute<00:02:11.450> ab<00:02:11.989> circuit<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.830> what<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.670> says<00:02:13.910> so

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
12-minute ab circuit is what it says so

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.940 
12-minute ab circuit is what it says so
you<00:02:14.330> go<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.660> every<00:02:14.870> machine<00:02:15.019> for<00:02:15.470> 12<00:02:15.739> minutes

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
you go on every machine for 12 minutes

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.370 
you go on every machine for 12 minutes
and<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.550> idea<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.480> thought<00:02:18.230> this

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and that's the idea I thought this

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.350 
and that's the idea I thought this
machine<00:02:18.739> felt<00:02:19.010> really<00:02:19.370> comfortable<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.120> felt

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
machine felt really comfortable I felt

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.580 
machine felt really comfortable I felt
so<00:02:20.660> strong<00:02:20.989> coming<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.680> out<00:02:21.800> but<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.560> that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
so strong coming in and out but so that

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.470 
so strong coming in and out but so that
beat<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.549> heard<00:02:25.730> comes<00:02:26.150> from<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
beat that you just heard comes from a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.300 
beat that you just heard comes from a
circuit<00:02:26.840> training<00:02:27.049> alarm<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.950> goes<00:02:27.980> off

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
circuit training alarm that goes off

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.970 
circuit training alarm that goes off
every<00:02:28.549> 60<00:02:29.060> seconds<00:02:29.570> in<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.870> area<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.440> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
every 60 seconds in this area and I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.740 
every 60 seconds in this area and I
didn't<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:31.489> appreciate<00:02:31.579> it<00:02:32.180> because<00:02:32.420> I

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
didn't really appreciate it because I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.590 
didn't really appreciate it because I
thought<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.500> set<00:02:34.190> off<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.610> infamous<00:02:35.239> lunk

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
thought I just set off the infamous lunk

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.000 
thought I just set off the infamous lunk
alarm<00:02:35.930> every<00:02:36.230> time<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.410> went<00:02:36.650> off

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
alarm every time I went off

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
alarm every time I went off
and<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.489> found<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.820> rather<00:02:37.970> distracting<00:02:38.840> but

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and I found it rather distracting but

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.030 

you<00:03:29.150> know<00:03:29.269> my<00:03:29.450> view<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.080> after<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> couple<00:03:30.950> of

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
you know my view so after a couple of

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.800 
you know my view so after a couple of
leg<00:03:31.280> lifts<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.819> some<00:03:32.060> crunches<00:03:32.540> we're

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
leg lifts and some crunches we're

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.410 
leg lifts and some crunches we're
closing<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.290> out<00:03:33.379> with<00:03:33.709> this<00:03:34.400> ab<00:03:34.909> crunch

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
closing it out with this ab crunch

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
machine over here so overall I was

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.670 
machine over here so overall I was
pretty<00:03:38.150> satisfied<00:03:38.420> with<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.080> experience
