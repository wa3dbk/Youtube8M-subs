see<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:28.949> okay<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.090> time

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

the<00:00:30.449> voodoo<00:00:30.750> blues

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.880 

you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.030 

so<00:01:26.730> I'll<00:01:26.790> try<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> keep<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.420> controls<00:01:28.040> roughly

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
so I'll try to keep the controls roughly

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
so I'll try to keep the controls roughly
the<00:01:29.190> same<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.760> each<00:01:30.060> taking<00:01:30.870> into<00:01:31.080> account

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the same on each taking into account

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
the same on each taking into account
that<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> drive<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.760> output<00:01:33.060> levels

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that the the drive and the output levels

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
that the the drive and the output levels
work<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.840> different<00:01:34.260> on<00:01:34.350> each<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.360> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
work a bit different on each one and the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.570 
work a bit different on each one and the
fatness<00:01:36.780> control<00:01:37.230> that<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:38.130> pedals

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
fatness control that all these pedals

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.400 
fatness control that all these pedals
have<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.030> basically<00:01:39.300> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.110> tan

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
have is basically kind of like a tan

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.160 
have is basically kind of like a tan
inverse<00:01:40.910> tone<00:01:41.910> control<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.660> when<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.870> have<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
inverse tone control so when you have it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.390 
inverse tone control so when you have it
fully<00:01:45.350> clockwise<00:01:48.440> anti-clockwise<00:01:49.440> whatever

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
fully clockwise anti-clockwise whatever

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.320 
fully clockwise anti-clockwise whatever
that<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.730> you<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.690> brightest<00:01:52.170> sound

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.470 

as<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.990> turn<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.410> around<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.920> right<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.610> it

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
as you turn it around to the right as it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.140 
as you turn it around to the right as it
gets<00:02:02.900> feather<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.920> also<00:02:04.100> cuts<00:02:04.550> out<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.790> trip

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
gets feather it also cuts out the trip

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:15.400 
gets feather it also cuts out the trip
the<00:02:05.330> treble<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.750> dullest<00:02:14.750> sound<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.320> these

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the treble the dullest sound and these

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:26.040 
the treble the dullest sound and these
thickest

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.780 

radically<00:02:27.050> different<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.470> sounds

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.000 

so<00:02:35.689> that's<00:02:35.930> pretty<00:02:36.110> interesting<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.830> works

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
so that's pretty interesting that works

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.640 
so that's pretty interesting that works
the<00:02:37.159> same<00:02:37.370> across<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.209> pedals<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.230> let's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the same across all the pedals so let's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.690 
the same across all the pedals so let's
have<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.799> listen<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.129> a<00:02:40.189> couple<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.459> different

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
have a listen to a couple of different

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.839 
have a listen to a couple of different
settings<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.180> these<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.349> I<00:02:42.799> crank<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> drive

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
settings on these so I crank the drive

00:02:43.849 --> 00:03:04.360 
settings on these so I crank the drive
up<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.120> little<00:02:44.299> bit<00:02:44.450> more

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.759 

so<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.330> get<00:03:05.720> really<00:03:06.050> into<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.410> Shubh

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
so you get really into that Shubh

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:16.150 
so you get really into that Shubh
screaming<00:03:07.220> out<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.430> range<00:03:14.680> all<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.830> way<00:03:15.950> into

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
screaming out of range all the way into

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:31.550 
screaming out of range all the way into
any<00:03:16.489> drive<00:03:16.910> up<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.239> bit<00:03:17.390> more<00:03:17.569> on<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.980 

much<00:03:32.459> more<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.819> fuzzy<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.750> sound

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
much more of a fuzzy kind of a sound

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.470 
much more of a fuzzy kind of a sound
very<00:03:34.709> cool<00:03:34.950> works<00:03:35.280> fantastic<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> single

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
very cool works fantastic on the single

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.750 
very cool works fantastic on the single
coil<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.010> fatness<00:03:38.370> control

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
coil and you can see the fatness control

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
coil and you can see the fatness control
is<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.209> way<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.569> right<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.050> still

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
is all the way to the right and still

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.470 
is all the way to the right and still
quite<00:03:40.650> bright<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.700> pull<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.060> around<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
quite bright we pull that around to the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.600 
quite bright we pull that around to the
left

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.550 

very<00:03:51.480> much<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> first-time<00:03:53.210> then<00:03:54.210> we<00:03:54.810> go<00:03:54.960> over

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
very much a first-time then we go over

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.430 
very much a first-time then we go over
to<00:03:55.740> here<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.600> I'm<00:03:57.600> gonna<00:03:57.690> get<00:03:57.960> my<00:03:58.080> head<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
to here and I'm gonna get my head in the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.020 
to here and I'm gonna get my head in the
way<00:03:58.530> oh<00:03:58.560> no<00:03:58.680> if<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.070> turn<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.370> fatness<00:03:59.700> control

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
way oh no if I turn the fatness control

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.430 
way oh no if I turn the fatness control
all<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.300> way<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.630> right<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:00.900> crank<00:04:01.320> the
