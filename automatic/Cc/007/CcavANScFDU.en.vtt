00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.090 
pretty much all you want to do is gather
a<00:03:44.700> small<00:03:44.790> amount<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> hair<00:03:46.110> around<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.650> crown

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
a small amount of hair around the crown

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.729 
a small amount of hair around the crown
of<00:03:47.130> your<00:03:47.430> head<00:03:47.640> into<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.570> little<00:03:48.900> ponytail<00:03:49.260> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
of your head into a little ponytail and

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.500 
of your head into a little ponytail and
then<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.550> start<00:03:50.790> clipping<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.360> your

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
then just start clipping in your

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.020 
then just start clipping in your
extensions<00:03:52.230> around<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:53.340> base<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
extensions around that base of the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.199 
extensions around that base of the
ponytail<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.520> personally<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:56.550> don't<00:03:56.790> use<00:03:57.030> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
ponytail and personally I don't use a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.240 
ponytail and personally I don't use a
full<00:03:57.750> set<00:03:58.080> of<00:03:58.230> extensions<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:59.100> this

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
full set of extensions for this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.040 
full set of extensions for this
otherwise<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.940> find<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.480> there<00:04:00.660> are<00:04:00.780> way<00:04:00.989> too

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
otherwise I find that there are way too

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.500 
otherwise I find that there are way too
many<00:04:01.260> clips<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.980> try<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.310> cover<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.150> use

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
many clips to try and cover so I use

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.750 
many clips to try and cover so I use
about<00:04:03.780> half<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.530> set<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.010> then<00:04:05.489> obviously

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
about half of a set and then obviously

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.790 
about half of a set and then obviously
just<00:04:06.150> want<00:04:06.480> to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
just want to

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.790 
just want to

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.890 
my hair up and tie it off in one big
ponytail<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.910> might<00:04:11.120> find<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.570> some<00:04:11.750> of

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
ponytail you might find that some of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.720
