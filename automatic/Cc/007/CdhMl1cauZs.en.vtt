00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.550 
ghosts and we saw how that game turned
out<00:01:40.350> pretty<00:01:40.560> slow<00:01:41.250> paced<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.970> uh<00:01:42.259> sluggish<00:01:43.259> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
out pretty slow paced and uh sluggish so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
out pretty slow paced and uh sluggish so
I<00:01:43.860> wasn't<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.640> pleased<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.299> game

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I wasn't really pleased with that game

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
I wasn't really pleased with that game
I'm<00:01:45.840> trying<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.649> my<00:01:46.710> hopes<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
I'm trying not to get my hopes of that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
I'm trying not to get my hopes of that
much<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> game<00:01:48.659> advanced<00:01:49.079> warfare

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
much for this game advanced warfare

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
much for this game advanced warfare
because<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.799> feel<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> get

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
because I feel like the more you get

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
because I feel like the more you get
your<00:01:51.180> hopes<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.750> excited<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> game

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
your hopes up and excited for the game

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.929 
your hopes up and excited for the game
then<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:52.979> kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.310> disappointed<00:01:53.909> with

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
then you're kind of disappointed with

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.510 
then you're kind of disappointed with
what<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.159> seems<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
what you actually get and that seems to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
what you actually get and that seems to
be<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> case<00:01:57.060> ever<00:01:57.390> since<00:01:57.509> mar<00:01:58.020> 4<00:01:58.229> 3<00:01:58.439> came<00:01:58.649> out

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
be the case ever since mar 4 3 came out

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
be the case ever since mar 4 3 came out
it<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.820> slowly<00:02:00.090> started<00:02:00.570> going

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
it kind of just slowly started going

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
it kind of just slowly started going
downhill<00:02:00.930> cold<00:02:01.409> did<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> did<00:02:02.000> unfortunately

of black ops when I love that game it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360 
of black ops when I love that game it
seemed<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.980> was<00:02:47.070> kind<00:02:47.280> of

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
seemed to have you know it was kind of

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.980 
seemed to have you know it was kind of
shitty<00:02:47.580> hit<00:02:47.850> detection<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.480> connection<00:02:48.930> in

shitty hit detection in connection in
that<00:02:49.110> game<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> map<00:02:49.890> design<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.970> me<00:02:51.180> was

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that game but the map design to me was

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.270 
that game but the map design to me was
absolutely<00:02:52.080> perfect<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.680> color<00:02:52.890> correction

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
absolutely perfect the color correction

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.010 
absolutely perfect the color correction
on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> game<00:02:53.610> looked<00:02:53.820> good<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.660> gun<00:02:54.810> had

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
on the game looked good and that gun had

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.370 
on the game looked good and that gun had
a<00:02:55.050> lot<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.680> gun<00:02:56.490> on<00:02:56.760> gun<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.780> know<00:02:57.900> skill<00:02:58.260> in

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
a lot of gun on gun you know skill in

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.140 
a lot of gun on gun you know skill in
that<00:02:58.530> game<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.920> took<00:02:59.220> quite<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.580> few<00:02:59.820> bullets

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
that game you took quite a few bullets

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.060 
that game you took quite a few bullets
which<00:03:00.300> meant<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.750> accuracy<00:03:01.140> had<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.830> good

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
which meant your accuracy had to be good

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.100 
which meant your accuracy had to be good
you<00:03:02.520> had<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.820> be<00:03:03.090> consistent<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.780> your<00:03:03.960> gun

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
you had to be consistent with your gun

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.080 
you had to be consistent with your gun
skills<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.220> everything<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:05.880> I

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
skills and everything like that so I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.150 
skills and everything like that so I
think<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:06.660> why<00:03:06.990> black<00:03:07.620> ops<00:03:07.800> one<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.070> my

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
think that's why black ops one is my

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.710 
think that's why black ops one is my
