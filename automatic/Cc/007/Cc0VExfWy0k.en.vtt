anyways I'll kind of explain what I'm
going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> second<00:00:43.110> uh<00:00:43.550> pretty

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
going to do here in a second uh pretty

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
going to do here in a second uh pretty
much<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> run<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> bomb

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
much what you do is you run to the bomb

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
much what you do is you run to the bomb
and<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> bots<00:00:46.800> don't<00:00:47.219> necessarily<00:00:47.640> sit<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
and the bots don't necessarily sit in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
and the bots don't necessarily sit in
one<00:00:48.059> exact<00:00:48.480> spot<00:00:48.809> it'll<00:00:49.170> stay<00:00:49.410> right<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:49.649> at

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
one exact spot it'll stay right there at

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
one exact spot it'll stay right there at
the<00:00:50.579> bomb<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.469> whatnot<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.219> pretty<00:00:53.370> cool

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the bomb and whatnot so it's pretty cool

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
the bomb and whatnot so it's pretty cool
it's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> practice<00:00:54.989> trickshot

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it's a good way to practice trickshot

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
it's a good way to practice trickshot
and<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.100> spins<00:00:56.340> down<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.969> good

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and get your spins down all that good

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.380 
and get your spins down all that good
stuff<00:00:57.559> um<00:00:58.559> I've<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.550> already<00:00:59.879> used<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
stuff um I've actually already used it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.410 
stuff um I've actually already used it
and<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> works<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.050> well<00:01:01.199> uh<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.789> find

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and it works really well uh I do find
