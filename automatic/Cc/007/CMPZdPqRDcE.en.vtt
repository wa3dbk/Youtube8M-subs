00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.259
 today by clicking on the Academy of German air traffic control at Frankfurt am Main 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.669
 Main 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.039
 Time pressure in the handling of the nightly in the German post 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.439
 wing 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.480
 and fulfilled childhood dream like a young pilot's workplace 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 to get to know 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.800
 Air traffic over Germany 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 the air traffic controllers of the German air traffic control 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.830
 we have the task to ensure a smooth flow in the sky 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.610
 with radio they coordinate the route of the aircraft in their 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.610
 respective sector 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.410
 generally what I say 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 there will be more persecution if they do not 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.870
 in court 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.900
 to resist 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 maintained the city tour 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 high concentration ability good spatial imagination as well 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.789
 a talent for communication 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.029
 the German air traffic control is interested in suitable offspring 

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:16.740
 Smoking regularly 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830
 new staff members 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.360
 Firstly, air traffic was growing in Germany and secondly because of course 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.250
 also the employee coworkers over the deserved retirement go that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.340
 means if regular food needs 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.030
 But from the space growth rates in the arms now needs now 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 young people who looks to us to get air traffic controller 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.760
 Half of Frankfurt Airport sees the Academy of German Air Traffic Control 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.859
 All air traffic controllers of the country are trained here Aachen 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.990
 They accompany 5 apprentices on their first day at the academy 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 The reasons for choosing a career vary widely 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.000
 Somehow that saved me 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 However, but bags pocket television is expected and found it 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.720
 interesting is that the kindergarten could be 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.190
 the tenth place made it 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.090
 made in thus morning flight and hot water for the pilot 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 and then it gets me more and more set apart you have to finally get it 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.240
 Career aspiration the man in the gate was one should what we actually do so new 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.319
 noticed, that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 that a listener would do something like that 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.269
 before it starts, each newcomer gets the official ID 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.269
 the academy 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.709
 For safety reasons, the trainees always have to carry the ID with them 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.349
 carry 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 only then can they move freely around the site 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.949
 I am for the local upper middle-class so should June 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.949
 but should try all the more 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.559
 very friendly open minded politicians curious which 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.249
 The agenda includes a visit to Computer Based Training 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.240
 Studio from amateur to professional 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.020
 Instructor Bernhard Fischer has a suitable course for every level of difficulty 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.169
 training program 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.299
 but for starters, we would like to start with the first basic research 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.799
 hold 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.039
 so that they understand the principle and then slowly increase gradually 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.719
 Let's start with a rather simple left and right play 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.419
 for Kerstin Walter against all women clichés absolutely no problem 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.249
 In a selection process, all newcomers have already proven the spatial 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.109
 Orientation one of its strengths is to kill millions 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.109
 agreed to leave again in Munich 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.489
 Customer is determined 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.620
 not get too close 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.359
 Minute that 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.359
 more complicated points in the luggage allowed 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.740
 Simple games are on the first day 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.520
 but soon our five will notice that it does not stay that way 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.229
 The one-year basic education at the academy is required of them a lot 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.309
 in another month's son's areas 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.879
 will go to celebrate the waves then is bishop and 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.679
 more complex 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.279
 leading Mur 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.089
 lasted to month or 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:11.629
 Rheine 360 ​​° to samples 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.629
 Reach Franke 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.309
 and if so 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:18.059
 the Münster's percent 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.059
 Tutorial here 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.540
 the theoretical ones then know to practical application afterwards 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.750
 just take up the job and continue to deepen 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.879
 then it goes into the first theory hour 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.539
 in her speech 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.539
 they decided 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.509
 the language of the air traffic controllers is English with a preference for crisp 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.069
 Abbreviations Instructor Roland Rau gives the newcomers a small 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.080
 taste 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.180
 Jürgen Klopp citizen I would like any 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.229
 I beg your pardon 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.719
 the room fills with question marks but incomprehensible brevity in the 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.719
 Air traffic is English now and then the a and o 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.460
 have the theoretical basis 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.650
 then I can go in the practical part 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.350
 yes and that's what we're going to teach here at the Academy 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.900
 theoretical part 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.930
 and then go immediately 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.260
 in our simulation to facilities 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.980
 Wu this theory we have in practice percent over allowances 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.470
 A career with high responsibility would reward the reward 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.180
 interesting and safe workplace in aviation as well as from the beginning 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.660
 a very good remuneration that will rise up to 100,000 euros a year 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.660
 the weather in north rhine-westphalia at 9 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.349
 the air traffic control is divided into two areas well known that the 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.499
 Work of the air traffic controllers in the tower they coordinate the arrivals and departures 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.499
 all German airports 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.550
 as soon as the aircraft is the responsibility of the tower 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.220
 leave 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.810
 the colleagues in the control centers take command of them 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.619
 the machines safely through the intersecting traffic 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:12.509
 up to the destination airport are also with domestic German flights usually dozens 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.509
 Air traffic controllers involved in the handling of a flight 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.939
 the largest control center of German air traffic control is located 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.319
 on the grounds of the academy in long at Frankfurt here can the 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.199
 Visiting apprentices in the immediate vicinity of their future workplace 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.449
 the olympic norm 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.050
 Deitmer Spadaro can 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.490
 Wegmann Bor 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.740
 something with Brandauer 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.259
 Anticipation prevails 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.260
 Thomas Schlüter called new house has been an air traffic controller for 16 years 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.530
 in his shift break, he takes a few minutes for the newcomers 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.279
 under 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.279
 they are always very happy 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.389
 I've got one more year left today 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.789
 who does everything according to plan 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.550
 Volkswagen back 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.589
 the critic side is 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:15.589
 is inadmissible 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.389
 ten to fifteen times im friendly 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:24.050
 but now that the weather is held by programs, for example 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.599
 growth rates 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.490
 then you have to persevere in all policy fields and then you are 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.589
 there too 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.589
 the visitors alone on this one 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.289
 he assures 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:38.279
 So right now 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:42.249
 so that one can not be trusted in the temporary work Verbunds goes with the 

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:42.999
 Internet 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:44.779
 the next race 

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.610
 therefore the flight had gone 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.080
 Cameron "There have been scanners since 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.210
 The first day passes quickly 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.030
 the 5 are looking forward to the training
