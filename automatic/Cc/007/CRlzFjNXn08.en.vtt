00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello everyone welcome to our course 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.670
 of design and animation in 3-d with cinema 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.119
 is the number 10 choice today we are going to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.560
 see the last type of nurbs that we 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.540
 it was about the hyper nur we had 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.930
 seen the previous lessons the rest 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.630
 of the types of standards and we leave this 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.670
 last the and bolts for the end because 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.890
 is the most important of the most 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.809
 uses the hyper will not allow us 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.780
 develop more simply 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.109
 organic models what the hyper does 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.479
 nur is smoothing the edges in models 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.059
 that have little polygons 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:49.790
 I will show you in a simple way how 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.970
 act if we have a cube 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.870
 and we divide it into segments of we put 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.990
 three segments at x three segments ali and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.900
 we leave a segment for depth 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:07.250
 if we convert that inevitable object and 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.030
 then we put it as the dog's son 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.740
 the hyper is not going to subdivide it in this 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.350
 view is not seen but if we select the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.330
 hyper are not going to see that our cube 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.180
 now it has a lot more 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 large subdivisions and at the same 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.960
 time softens the edges 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.320
 in this way we can activate and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.190
 disable hyper nur to be able to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.560
 model our cube as if it were 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.490
 of an object subdivided and with edges 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.910
 curved we can then select each 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910
 one 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.120
 and its polygons and handle it like 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.100
 we want to be able to model if 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.050
 we deactivate the hyper we are not going to give 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.320
 account for the deformations that we were 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.590
 doing let's go from zero we're going to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.480
 start from a sphere in this case and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.990
 instead of 24 segments we are going to do it 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.380
 of 2 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.620
 let's go for a practical and simple case 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.400
 of modeling with hyper nur let's do 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.970
 which is expected to be an editable object and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.520
 let's apply a hyper nur 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.190
 to her 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.370
 we turn off the hyper nur we can 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370
 select 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.900
 these two faces for example 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.010
 and destroy them 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.010
 inward 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.010
 to generate through the hyper nur 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.010
 eyes 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.760
 we can make another extrusion more 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.760
 to achieve an effect 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.000
 and in this case you are going to see that yes 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.000
 I did render 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.400
 the hyper is going to generate a series of 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.040
 subdivisions but not enough 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.040
 as to avoid these 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.400
 details on the edges what can I 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.370
 do then is go to that and bolts and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.130
 apply more subdivisions in editor in 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.320
 two times I'll put three with what 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.160
 which is going to multiply the amount of 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.420
 subdivisions and I'm going to have a render 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.180
 much sharper 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.400
 the same thing we can do 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.599
 for the case of the mouth of this face 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.599
 let's instruct 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.170
 and we can also 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.430
 select 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.090
 the polygons of the sides for 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.239
 also exclude them 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.239
 and generate some species of ears 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.490
 I could add a neck in this 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.280
 case what we should do to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.240
 add the neck is to go to the tool 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.310
 of selection 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.310
 and use a cyclical selection 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.940
 that will allow us to select with 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.070
 greater ease 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.300
 then we return to the tool 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.500
 Exclude 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.810
 and we do not one but two exclusions 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.810
 to achieve the effect we need 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.680
 see as in this way 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.990
 applying and explaining the hyper nur us 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.740
 we are guiding to do a modeling 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.740
 organic 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.629
 that's all for today thanks for continuing 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.119
 the lessons of this course I hope that 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.249
 they are very useful to you and that 

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:21.599
 Any doubt leave us your comment or 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.739
 consultation at www point more resources 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.159

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.159
 until next time
