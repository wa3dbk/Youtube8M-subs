this<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.660> actually<00:00:07.700> the<00:00:08.700> morning<00:00:09.030> after<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
this is actually the morning after the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.799 
this is actually the morning after the
surgery<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.790> would<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:11.880> done<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.269> video<00:00:12.599> last

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
surgery I would have done a video last

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.189 
surgery I would have done a video last
night<00:00:13.400> but<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.730> surgery<00:00:15.719> was<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
night but my surgery was in the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.870 
night but my surgery was in the
afternoon<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> didn't<00:00:17.340> actually<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:17.760> out

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
afternoon so I didn't actually get out

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.870 
afternoon so I didn't actually get out
so<00:00:18.180> uh<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> bit<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:20.010> 7

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
so uh I think it was a bit about 7

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
so uh I think it was a bit about 7
o'clock<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.330> something<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.039> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
o'clock or something and then I have to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
o'clock or something and then I have to
travel<00:00:23.340> quite<00:00:23.550> away<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> ever<00:00:25.080> had

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
travel quite away so what I ever had

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.130 
travel quite away so what I ever had
where<00:00:25.500> he<00:00:25.800> wasn't<00:00:26.039> feeling<00:00:26.960> doctor<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> was

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
where he wasn't feeling doctor I was

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.530 
where he wasn't feeling doctor I was
pretty<00:00:28.349> tired<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:32.090> don't<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.360> I'd

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
pretty tired I don't I don't know if I'd

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
pretty tired I don't I don't know if I'd
probably<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> sweaty<00:00:34.200> buddy<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.210> don't

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
probably have a sweaty buddy but I don't

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.619 
probably have a sweaty buddy but I don't
react<00:00:36.510> very<00:00:36.719> well<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:38.180> anaesthetic<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
react very well with anaesthetic it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.110 
react very well with anaesthetic it
seems<00:00:40.040> my<00:00:41.040> previous<00:00:41.340> operation<00:00:41.790> would<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
seems my previous operation would I have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
seems my previous operation would I have

laughter<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.710> wasn't<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.799> any<00:01:37.950> pain<00:01:38.070> when

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
laughter it's I wasn't in any pain when

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.560 
laughter it's I wasn't in any pain when
I<00:01:38.549> wake<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:40.250> I've<00:01:41.250> still<00:01:41.460> any<00:01:41.759> pain<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.299> haven't

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
I wake up I've still any pain I haven't

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
I wake up I've still any pain I haven't
taken<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:43.020> paintless<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.520> actual

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
taken any paintless and see the actual

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.810 
taken any paintless and see the actual
surgery<00:01:45.259> so<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.490> feels<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
surgery so that's pretty good it feels a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.069 
surgery so that's pretty good it feels a
little<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.030> weird<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> more

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
little bit weird but I think it's more

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.480 
little bit weird but I think it's more
like<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> calf's<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:50.070> read<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.369> mind

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
like the calf's actually read my mind

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.859 
like the calf's actually read my mind
though<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.670> feels<00:01:51.149> weird<00:01:51.360> well<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.810> II

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
though that feels weird well then II

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.580 
though that feels weird well then II
think<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.729> hope<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.630> did<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.079> her<00:01:55.140> how<00:01:55.259> much<00:01:55.409> she

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
think I hope I did see her how much she

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
think I hope I did see her how much she
got<00:01:55.770> any<00:01:56.570> any<00:01:57.570> bruising<00:01:58.110> anything<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.219> far<00:01:59.840> I'm

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
through so I'd recommend have Vaseline

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.670 
through so I'd recommend have Vaseline
nearby<00:05:02.590> because<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.990> just<00:05:05.140> made<00:05:05.260> my<00:05:05.410> lips

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
I'm not comfortable otherwise it just

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.920 
I'm not comfortable otherwise it just
was<00:05:09.610> awful<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.120> if<00:05:10.240> your<00:05:10.360> lips<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.840> that

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
was awful and if your lips and that

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.360 
was awful and if your lips and that
football<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.530> start<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.220> feel<00:05:12.340> more

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
awful anyway so the Vaseline really

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.490 
awful anyway so the Vaseline really
helped<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.490> make<00:05:15.820> my<00:05:15.940> lips<00:05:16.120> more<00:05:16.480> bit<00:05:17.380> more

probably<00:06:05.350> recommend<00:06:05.910> it's<00:06:06.910> one<00:06:07.060> of<00:06:07.180> these

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
probably recommend it's one of these

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.270 
probably recommend it's one of these
because<00:06:07.630> where<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.140> have<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.380> sleep<00:06:08.590> up<00:06:08.950> from

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
because where you have to sleep up from

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.120 
because where you have to sleep up from
that<00:06:09.880> bright<00:06:10.260> might<00:06:11.260> be<00:06:11.380> uncomfortable<00:06:11.770> even

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
that bright might be uncomfortable even

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.590 
that bright might be uncomfortable even
though<00:06:12.310> I've<00:06:12.370> got<00:06:12.520> loads<00:06:13.060> of<00:06:13.300> pillows

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
though I've got loads of pillows

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.150 
though I've got loads of pillows
climbing<00:06:13.990> loads<00:06:14.320> and<00:06:14.650> loads<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:14.920> loads<00:06:15.010> of

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
climbing loads and loads and loads of

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.290 
climbing loads and loads and loads of
pillows<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:17.560> just<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.980> don't<00:06:18.640> feel<00:06:18.880> I<00:06:19.000> can<00:06:19.030> get

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
pillows it just I don't feel I can get

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.540 
pillows it just I don't feel I can get
support<00:06:19.480> my<00:06:20.140> neck<00:06:20.350> very<00:06:20.530> much<00:06:20.800> so<00:06:21.100> I've<00:06:21.370> got

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
support my neck very much so I've got

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.100 
support my neck very much so I've got
one<00:06:21.670> of<00:06:21.760> these<00:06:21.880> which<00:06:22.210> my<00:06:22.360> mom<00:06:22.510> found<00:06:22.720> one<00:06:23.020> of

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
one of these which my mom found one of

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.790 
one of these which my mom found one of
the<00:06:23.200> thing<00:06:23.890> you<00:06:24.010> have<00:06:24.720> on<00:06:25.720> their<00:06:26.260> plane<00:06:26.470> and

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
the thing you have on their plane and

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.250 
the thing you have on their plane and
that's<00:06:27.130> mainly<00:06:27.670> sleeping<00:06:28.270> upright<00:06:28.990> a<00:06:29.020> lot

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
that's mainly sleeping upright a lot

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.100 
that's mainly sleeping upright a lot
more<00:06:29.410> comfortable<00:06:29.590> so<00:06:30.100> I'd<00:06:30.790> recommend<00:06:31.360> even

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
more comfortable so I'd recommend even

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.230 
more comfortable so I'd recommend even
getting<00:06:32.710> one<00:06:32.800> of<00:06:32.830> those<00:06:32.950> ready<00:06:33.220> or<00:06:33.520> having<00:06:34.000> one

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
getting one of those ready or having one

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.640 
getting one of those ready or having one
of<00:06:34.270> those<00:06:34.390> or<00:06:34.600> boring<00:06:34.990> one<00:06:35.170> of<00:06:35.290> those<00:06:35.410> because

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
of those or boring one of those because

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.670 
of those or boring one of those because
it<00:06:35.800> could<00:06:35.920> make<00:06:36.100> it<00:06:36.340> a<00:06:36.370> lot<00:06:36.460> more

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
it could make it a lot more

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.090 
it could make it a lot more
comfortable<00:06:37.160> sleeping<00:06:37.970> upright<00:06:38.470> and<00:06:39.470> I<00:06:39.830> can't

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
comfortable sleeping upright and I can't

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.100 
comfortable sleeping upright and I can't
I<00:06:40.250> think<00:06:40.280> it<00:06:40.490> really<00:06:40.580> helps<00:06:41.030> northing<00:06:41.840> over<00:06:41.960> as

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
I think it really helps northing over as

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.930 
I think it really helps northing over as
well<00:06:42.289> because<00:06:42.560> I'd<00:06:42.650> wear<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.460> obviously

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
well because I'd wear it obviously

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.490 
well because I'd wear it obviously
supporting<00:06:44.449> your<00:06:44.570> side<00:06:44.840> you<00:06:45.050> can't<00:06:45.289> really

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
supporting your side you can't really

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.800 
supporting your side you can't really
roll<00:06:45.740> over<00:06:46.039> so<00:06:46.220> much<00:06:46.370> so<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:47.240> didn't<00:06:47.539> roll<00:06:47.660> over

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
roll over so much so I didn't roll over

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.200 
roll over so much so I didn't roll over
the<00:06:48.110> night<00:06:48.259> or<00:06:48.440> anything<00:06:48.620> I<00:06:49.039> think<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.090> only

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
the night or anything I think the only

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.779 
the night or anything I think the only
problem<00:06:50.389> was<00:06:50.690> I<00:06:50.900> just<00:06:51.050> woke<00:06:51.800> up<00:06:51.830> a<00:06:52.340> lot<00:06:52.550> in<00:06:52.699> the
