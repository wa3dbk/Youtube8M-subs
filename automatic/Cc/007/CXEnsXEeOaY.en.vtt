00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 and hello everyone were at the doors and 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 bozik point fr and today we 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.529
 let's go unpacked the iphone 5 versions 32 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.130
 gigas bourgeoisie all this after ridge 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.130
 usual school 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.749
 no 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.150
 so madrolle iphone 5 to my left 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 the iphone 4 just for small 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.510
 comparison of boxes so here we get 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.310
 found with an overall picture we 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 showing the phone in its size 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.480
 the size of his screen while here we 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.330
 had a box showing us the part 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 superior iphone 4 or 4 s so 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.620
 as you can see the box to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 slightly grown since iphone 5 is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.370
 a bigger way we end up so 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.239
 on the sides with an apple that was 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 before chrome and so black oise here so 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.260
 with iphone 5 and 6 inscriptions 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.400
 iphone 4 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 so that's about all for the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 box changes here like you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.650
 can see it's a real fake 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.470
 debate the age since I do not have you 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.960
 waited to unpack it I could not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.830
 stop me from doing it before so 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.810
 normally you have your iphone here 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.940
 of course I have not removed the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.980
 protections since I have not yet 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.630
 my sweet 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.070
 here we are left with all the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.140
 papers as usual with the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.330
 stickers and the little accessory we 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 to remove or surrender the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.180
 SIM card 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.520
 so remember it's a nano 6 me 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.600
 against a micro sim for iphone 4 or 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.130
 4 s so that did not change much 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.530
 since it's still a flat charger 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.450
 so we have new apple headphones 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.550
 the irp ode what i have you 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.950
 previously unpacked since I 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.020
 had bought for my 4 so what 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.610
 change overall is the lightning 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.970
 since we are left with an adapter 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.729
 much finer than before since 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.880
 before we were used to the docks 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.880
 classical 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.760
 so here's a reminder of the dock 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.910
 that was it and the lightning is that so 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.160
 is this little card here that is born 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.950
 puts in both directions so no longer need 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.250
 to find out if it's up or down 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.380
 low 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.080
 now the lightning can come 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.490
 in both directions so it's not bad 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.739
 of course apple could have put a 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.080
 micro usb but well again 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.250
 would not have had the monopoly 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.010
 so that's why they chose 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.900
 the lightning so if not in relation to 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.760
 iphone 4 so do I 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.150
 get to unpack it at the same time 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.250
 yes that's it then it's been done already on 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.940
 the net I know it but I like it 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.500
 make them me then here so sorry that 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.680
 move a bit since I'm doing it by hand 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.170
 raised as 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 as I do not have a tripod here so 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.640
 globally what is changing by 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.709
 compared to iphone 4 or 4s first 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.209
 the smoothness of the phone so like you 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.849
 can see it then I do not know 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.260
 if you will see the camera 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.719
 the iphone 5 has simply lost the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.209
 small black border here and there 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.950
 on the iphone 4 or 4 s so it's pretty much 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.840
 close everything for the smoothness of the phone 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.010
 in terms of comparison now I have 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.930
 voluntarily chosen to take 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.609
 the iphone 4 and not the 4s since 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.319
 is quite similar in characteristics 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.209
 at the iphone 5 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.040
 so here I'm going to follow my 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.200
 iphone 4 so what is changing by 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.629
 report to the iphone 4 on the iphone 5 well 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.099
 firstly on the big screen so 2 4 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.750
 inches to 3.5 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.319
 we are also left with 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.469
 cameras including career in 1080p 50 images 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.689
 seconds against 720p 30 frames second 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.159
 it seems to me on the iphone 4 we get 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.750
 also found with a camera of 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.000
 much better quality on the iphone 5 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.099
 since it is finally the 700th peace and 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.500
 not vga disgusting like on 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.109
 the iphone 4 or 4s so that's a point 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.629
 which differs from the iphone 4 or 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.979
 4 s then good of course the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.419
 connectivity since here we are 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.579
 would find that the classic doc is 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.889
 here the lightning as long as I'm not going 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.780
 bring me closer because here it is enough 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.359
 dark and you will not necessarily see 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.000
 and I let you search on the internet 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.709
 So that's about all here 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.989
 so ends up with a screen of 4 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.599
 inches against 3.5 which is much better 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.959
 contrasted since it will not be seen 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.400
 not necessarily on the camera but as 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.409
 you can see it here 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.830
 the screen is of much better quality 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:27.070
 so good maybe it's a little gadget 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.500
 but 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.260
 it's still comfortable enough then 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.270
 also what changes with respect to 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.050
 the iphone 4 is the autonomy that is 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.360
 much better 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 speed also since one gets 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.130
 found with news of 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.330
 new features compared to 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.890
 the iphone 4s or 4 so that's it then I do not 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.060
 do not go further because it's 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.700
 a quick comparative unpacking since 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.040
 I think the majority of bloggers 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.350
 have already done it and that you are at 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.240
 Prior teach them so it was 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.740
 theo for theo rosich point en I you 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.730
 wish a good late evening and I 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.730
 tell you very quickly
