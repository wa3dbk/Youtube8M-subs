00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
about the game history and I think in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
about the game history and I think in
2008<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.540> la<00:02:33.600> playa<00:02:33.810> started<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.380> advertise

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
this game as a hybrid MMORPG during that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.590 
this game as a hybrid MMORPG during that
time<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> think<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.640> there<00:02:38.880> were<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.090> trailers

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
time I think if there were the trailers

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.140 
time I think if there were the trailers
already<00:02:39.959> about<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.470> c9<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.820> action

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
already about the c9 with the action

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.350 
already about the c9 with the action
combat<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.650> game<00:02:43.830> does<00:02:44.070> have

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
combat going on the game does have

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.430 
combat going on the game does have
action<00:02:45.360> combat<00:02:45.540> even<00:02:45.900> though<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.200> pretty

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
action combat even though it's pretty

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.090 
action combat even though it's pretty
primitive<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.130> game<00:02:48.140> combat<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.170> pretty

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
primitive and the game combat is pretty

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.820 
primitive and the game combat is pretty
much<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.490> euro<00:02:50.700> top<00:02:51.390> targeting<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.170> you're

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
much a euro top targeting and you're

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.190 
much a euro top targeting and you're
gonna<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.550> when<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.330> try<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> play<00:02:54.870> in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
gonna see that when you try to play in

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
gonna see that when you try to play in
the<00:02:55.320> action<00:02:55.650> combat<00:02:55.860> even<00:02:56.640> though<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.910> can

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the action combat even though you can

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.350 
the action combat even though you can
shoot<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.390> weapon<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:58.110> any<00:02:58.320> kind<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.830> way<00:02:59.520> you

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
shoot your weapon in any kind of way you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.960 
shoot your weapon in any kind of way you
don't<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:01.350> get<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.920> dodge<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.520> enemy<00:03:02.790> or

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
don't actually get to dodge the enemy or

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.520 
don't actually get to dodge the enemy or
something<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.350> not

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
something like that so it's not

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.470 
something like that so it's not
meaningful<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.310> play<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.970> action<00:03:06.239> combat

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
meaningful to play in the action combat

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.570 
meaningful to play in the action combat
it<00:03:06.780> also<00:03:07.110> requires<00:03:07.440> more<00:03:07.680> skill<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.160> play<00:03:08.310> in

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
it also requires more skill to play in

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.910 
it also requires more skill to play in
the<00:03:08.910> action<00:03:09.209> combat<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.620> order<00:03:10.739> to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
the action combat because in order to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740 
the action combat because in order to
shoot<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.340> skill<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.180> have

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
shoot a skill we really have to have

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.570 
shoot a skill we really have to have
your<00:03:12.959> crosshair<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.980> enemy<00:03:14.100> otherwise

your crosshair on the enemy otherwise

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.210 
your crosshair on the enemy otherwise
you're<00:03:15.570> not<00:03:15.989> going<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.350> be<00:03:16.500> able<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.920> even

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
you're not going to be able to even

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.820 
you're not going to be able to even
shoot<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.570> only<00:03:18.690> shoot<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.560> normal

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
shoot it you can only shoot the normal

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.650 
shoot it you can only shoot the normal
attack<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.280> if<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.870> cannot<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.170> target<00:03:23.130> that

attack you if you cannot for target that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.570 
attack you if you cannot for target that
that<00:03:24.660> map<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.140> example<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.769> that's<00:03:26.040> that's<00:03:26.310> a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
that map for example so that's that's a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.820 
that map for example so that's that's a
kind<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.090> downside<00:03:27.570> even<00:03:28.380> though<00:03:28.530> it's

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
kind of a downside even though it's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.699 
kind of a downside even though it's
there<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.310> nothing<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.330> useful<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.140> you

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
there it's nothing really useful but you

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.460 
there it's nothing really useful but you
can<00:03:31.890> relax<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.610> whenever<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:34.049> want<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.320> do

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
about is the skill system the school

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.010 
about is the skill system the school
system<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.430> broken<00:04:58.699> three<00:04:59.090> big<00:04:59.330> skill<00:04:59.719> trees

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
system is broken three big skill trees

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.459 
system is broken three big skill trees
and<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:01.430> first<00:05:01.909> skill<00:05:02.240> tree<00:05:02.449> is<00:05:02.689> the<00:05:03.139> class

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
and the first skill tree is the class

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.589 
and the first skill tree is the class
which<00:05:03.889> pretty<00:05:04.159> much<00:05:04.250> can<00:05:04.610> be<00:05:04.639> really<00:05:05.300> easy<00:05:05.330> to

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
which pretty much can be really easy to

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.839 
which pretty much can be really easy to
understand<00:05:06.050> each<00:05:06.289> level<00:05:06.949> you<00:05:07.039> gain<00:05:07.250> one<00:05:07.580> skill

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
understand each level you gain one skill

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.969 
understand each level you gain one skill
point<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:09.020> unlock<00:05:09.139> one<00:05:09.620> ability

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
point and you can unlock one ability

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.760 
point and you can unlock one ability
what<00:05:10.250> upgrade<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.789> ability<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:12.319> abilities

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
what upgrade that ability the abilities

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.320 
what upgrade that ability the abilities
are<00:05:12.979> different<00:05:13.430> because<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.819> have<00:05:14.000> with<00:05:14.210> the
