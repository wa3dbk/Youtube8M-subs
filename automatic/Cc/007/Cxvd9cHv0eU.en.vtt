00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.200

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:29.250
 we are also going to use garlic salt 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.610

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.610

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.680
 preparing the sauce of three cheeses 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.680
 first let's see 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.680
 we preheat 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.930
 we shed the weight of this one that would be 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.540
 doing that would be the cheese 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.700
 cream 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.210
 and we constantly return it so that 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.210
 get sick 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.850
 After three minutes we reserve and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.920

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.260
 and a little bit expressed 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 we are going to 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.370
 expect our studies to reach 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.370
 a temperature of 74 degrees 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.479
 for your life 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.939
