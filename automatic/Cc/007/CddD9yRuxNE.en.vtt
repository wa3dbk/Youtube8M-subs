00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
flash and auto white balance on auto

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.530 
flash and auto white balance on auto
shop<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.720> RS<00:01:34.080> but<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.770> write<00:01:35.490> down<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.940> iso

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
shop with RS but I so write down or iso

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.040

via<00:01:37.040> is<00:01:38.040> also<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:38.790> auto<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.300> everything<00:01:39.660> else

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
via is also an auto and everything else

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.130 
via is also an auto and everything else
is<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:40.979> auto<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:41.910> is<00:01:41.970> tap<00:01:42.300> here<00:01:42.720> on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
is here on auto but if he is tap here on

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.999 
is here on auto but if he is tap here on
whatever<00:01:44.479> then<00:01:45.479> did<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.380> option<00:01:46.830> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
whatever then did you get an option to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.760 
whatever then did you get an option to
tweak<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> probably<00:01:52.500> some<00:01:52.740> kind

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
tweak it so this is probably some kind

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.050 
tweak it so this is probably some kind
of<00:01:52.920> focus<00:01:53.430> or<00:01:53.460> something

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of focus or something

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.910 
of focus or something
oh<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> maybe<00:01:57.140> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.470> something<00:01:58.680> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
oh so maybe if you have something in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.450 
oh so maybe if you have something in
front

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.230 

you<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.270> kind<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.630> decide<00:02:08.490> probably<00:02:09.490> where<00:02:09.789> it

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
you can kind of decide probably where it

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.320 
you can kind of decide probably where it
should<00:02:10.600> focus<00:02:12.870> I'm<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.020> gonna<00:02:14.110> go<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.410> auto

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
should focus I'm just gonna go with auto

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.910 
should focus I'm just gonna go with auto
white<00:02:16.330> balance<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:17.110> course<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.590> want<00:02:20.830> to

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
white balance of course if you want to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.210 
white balance of course if you want to
customize<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:22.290> then<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
customize it then you do have that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.790 
customize it then you do have that
little<00:02:24.580> like<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.150> option<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:27.510> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
little like little option in here and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.500 
little like little option in here and
then<00:02:29.800> we<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:31.420> utter<00:02:33.270> I'm<00:02:34.270> not

video<00:03:50.690> mode<00:03:56.980> which<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.790> interesting

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.250 

hmm<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.090> doesn't<00:04:05.120> seem<00:04:05.540> like<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:05.840> can<00:04:05.960> tap<00:04:06.230> the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
focus which I would say seems to be kind

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.580 
focus which I would say seems to be kind
of<00:04:10.520> bad<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:11.450> see<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.720> time<00:04:11.960> they're<00:04:12.320> going

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
play around with these and see how it

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:10.709 
play around with these and see how it
would<00:04:59.169> be

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:19.209 

experiment<00:05:11.719> with<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.990> exposure<00:05:18.219> or

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
experiment with the exposure or

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.999 
experiment with the exposure or
different<00:05:19.610> like<00:05:19.789> situations<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:21.650> can<00:05:21.830> see

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
different like situations you can see

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.689 
different like situations you can see
how<00:05:22.189> it<00:05:22.400> would<00:05:22.639> react<00:05:27.279> then<00:05:28.279> you<00:05:28.370> do<00:05:28.490> have<00:05:28.520> a

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
how it would react then you do have a

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:35.499 
how it would react then you do have a
bunch<00:05:28.939> of<00:05:29.120> different<00:05:30.039> modes<00:05:31.039> here<00:05:34.270> you<00:05:35.270> need<00:05:35.449> a

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
bunch of different modes here you need a

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.649 
bunch of different modes here you need a
special<00:05:36.080> focus<00:05:36.550> on<00:05:37.550> something<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:40.659> this

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
special focus on something and this

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.179 
special focus on something and this
could<00:05:41.870> definitely<00:05:41.960> be<00:05:42.349> a<00:05:42.439> nice<00:05:42.650> little<00:05:42.889> tool

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:43.189 
could definitely be a nice little tool

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.850 
could definitely be a nice little tool
so<00:05:44.029> ya<00:05:44.180> quickly<00:05:44.719> look<00:05:44.900> at<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.110> camera<00:05:45.680> app

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
hard to show in a video like this with

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.050 
hard to show in a video like this with
this<00:05:50.659> showing<00:05:51.379> the<00:05:51.560> software<00:05:52.069> but<00:05:52.340> then<00:05:52.759> it

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
this showing the software but then it

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.180 
this showing the software but then it
looks<00:05:53.300> very<00:05:53.810> nice<00:05:54.199> so<00:05:54.680> yeah<00:05:55.180> pizza
