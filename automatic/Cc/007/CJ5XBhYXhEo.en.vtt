hello<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.550> introduce<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.120> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
hello I want to introduce you to a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.030 
hello I want to introduce you to a
product<00:00:12.719> called<00:00:12.900> tylose<00:00:13.349> powder<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
product called tylose powder and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.099 
product called tylose powder and
basically<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.330> does<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> turns

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
basically what this does is it turns

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.960 
basically what this does is it turns
your<00:00:16.350> fondant<00:00:16.859> into<00:00:17.039> gum<00:00:17.490> paste

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
your fondant into gum paste

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.140 
your fondant into gum paste
so<00:00:18.260> basically<00:00:19.260> fondant<00:00:19.830> plus<00:00:20.130> tylose<00:00:20.640> equals

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
so basically fondant plus tylose equals

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.540 
so basically fondant plus tylose equals
gum<00:00:21.330> paste<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.779> there's<00:00:22.619> an<00:00:22.769> easy<00:00:23.010> formula

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
gum paste and there's an easy formula

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
gum paste and there's an easy formula
it's<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.210> 12<00:00:24.720> ounces<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.199> fondant<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.680> two

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
it's about 12 ounces of fondant to two

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.820 
it's about 12 ounces of fondant to two
teaspoons<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.640> tylose<00:00:27.539> powder<00:00:27.570> which<00:00:28.500> some

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
teaspoons of tylose powder which some

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.849 
teaspoons of tylose powder which some
people<00:00:29.039> also<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.550> CMC<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.740> don't

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
people also know as CMC but you don't

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
people also know as CMC but you don't
really<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.730> sometimes<00:00:33.120> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
really have to go by that sometimes you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.229 
really have to go by that sometimes you
might<00:00:33.420> need<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.989> less<00:00:34.829> strong<00:00:35.160> gum<00:00:35.730> paste<00:00:35.940> if

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
might need a less strong gum paste if

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.459 
might need a less strong gum paste if
you're<00:00:36.360> modeling<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.780> figure<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.350> need

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you're modeling a figure and you need

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
you're modeling a figure and you need
time<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.920> pinch<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> pull<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.879> emboss<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
time to pinch and pull and emboss that

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
time to pinch and pull and emboss that
sort<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> thing<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.620> other<00:00:40.770> times<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
sort of thing and then other times you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
sort of thing and then other times you
might<00:00:41.309> need<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:41.820> firm<00:00:42.210> gum<00:00:43.110> paste<00:00:43.320> if

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
might need a more firm gum paste if

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
might need a more firm gum paste if
you're<00:00:43.800> doing<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> big<00:00:44.670> loopy<00:00:45.030> both<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.480> needs

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you're doing a big loopy both it needs

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
you're doing a big loopy both it needs
to<00:00:45.719> hold<00:00:45.870> its<00:00:46.079> weight<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.610> gum<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.789> flowers

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to hold its weight or gum these flowers

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.119 
to hold its weight or gum these flowers
that<00:00:48.239> sort<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.469> there's<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.920> no

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that sort of thing so there's really no

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
that sort of thing so there's really no
wrong<00:00:50.370> formula<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> baking

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
wrong formula like there is in baking

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
wrong formula like there is in baking
sometimes<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.539> less

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
sometimes you just use more or less

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
sometimes you just use more or less
tylose<00:00:55.260> powder<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.100> need<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> an

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that really needs to dry nice and firm

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.710 
that really needs to dry nice and firm
that<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> great<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.820> use<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.450> gum

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

paste<00:01:51.899> instead<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> fondant<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.310> you'll

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
paste instead of a fondant so you'll

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
paste instead of a fondant so you'll
just<00:01:53.640> need<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.240> thoroughly<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> then
