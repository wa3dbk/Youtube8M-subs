00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.370
 as with the videos, it is broadcast 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:03.739
 a youtuber decides the entire entry 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 we look at them how much you dream for 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 I'm standing there with a pink jacket 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.700
 how can i my retails so i go now 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.700
 just make scissors subjects sincere 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.439
 I pack all the way from appearance and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.330
 here that nations we are here to the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.770
 backside and here comes one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 piece then you have a little note 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.500
 pay attention to what is always tilted backwards 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.869
 is doing 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 so here I first grab this piece for you 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.159
 so wonderful here you have the divorce 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 not in the keep so I grab you now 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.979
 foam this piece away 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.610
 but that way I make sure 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.670
 go 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.549
 whole is what naturally more beautiful 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.100
 if you already easily there it everywhere 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.630
 I end up braiding now 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.329
 first a bit through and then 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
 I will make a piece of linen dress correctly 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.270
 piece by braided 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 I just take a rubber band now 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.680
 no matter which and i put the flight in there 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.310
 to I stuck here then go following through with 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.310
 a dirty degree 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.300
 they fit him as a theme 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.100
 that no longer move so hot I do 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.050
 that because it is then easier to 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.580
 the fishbone make just two you 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.320
 changes from one to the other into the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.060
 fishbone and this would have the loose 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.340
 and then or the stricter 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.900
 can divide into 2 pieces 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.880
 but I noticed that running loose 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.050
 Fricka de Haar does not need to be trapped 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.510
 so beautiful 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.130
 I divide you in two and I will leave now 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.830
 just fish goes but I also have one 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.420
 video form suzanne sound where you go to 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.330
 must look is that you now also not 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.540
 is going to pull towards yourself or 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.190
 lighting that side but especially with it 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.720
 head remains 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.640
 otherwise you will need the connection 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.220
 between the braid and the fishbone too 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.780
 loose plus that you actually have the braid 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.870
 pull the head off you stay whole 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.390
 clearly in her neck here the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:03.170
 make fishbone so keep going 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.670
 until always i'm done with the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.410
 fish bone 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.140
 is pretty tightly braided allowing play 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.459
 Euro cease doing but 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.470
 if you want queer of course 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.660
 just take it apart 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.489
 I now call grant from just a piece 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.950
 in it for tessa I actually think it is the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.230
 soon because it is very thin 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.310
 I'd rather disassemble this one 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.810
 bit 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.290
 a piece of violence I'm going to cross one 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.780
 there is something braid loose and so on 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.049
 and such a nice transition between the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.750
 braid and it is hit 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.000
 I also have something loose and it is bright 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.880
 also very tight but in between 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.959
 just or not that very full hair 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.079
 maybe you will get roermond too 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.329
 so I pull it slightly apart 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.280
 and then I put it over her shoulder 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.350
 and that's how we have liquid 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.329
 thanks for watching i see you 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.549
 next Wednesday for a new tip 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.549

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.790
