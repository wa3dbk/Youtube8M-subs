got our position where we want our

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.020 
got our position where we want our
ticker<00:01:29.740> motor<00:01:30.039> now<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.340> have<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.609> drill<00:01:30.819> some

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
ticker motor now we have to drill some

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.510 
ticker motor now we have to drill some
holes<00:01:31.499> all<00:01:32.499> right<00:01:32.709> we're<00:01:32.859> ready<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.100> drill<00:01:33.399> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
holes all right we're ready to drill the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.550 
holes all right we're ready to drill the
hole<00:01:33.729> for<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.539> application<00:01:35.229> we're<00:01:35.350> going<00:01:35.469> to

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
hole for this application we're going to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.499 
hole for this application we're going to
use<00:01:35.709> a<00:01:35.740> lag<00:01:36.429> screw<00:01:36.789> instead<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.209> a<00:01:37.270> through

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
use a lag screw instead of a through

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.020 
use a lag screw instead of a through
bolt<00:01:37.810> because<00:01:38.409> we<00:01:38.679> can't<00:01:38.950> get<00:01:39.130> access<00:01:39.609> to<00:01:39.819> the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
bolt because we can't get access to the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.969 
bolt because we can't get access to the
back<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.869> boat<00:01:41.049> here<00:01:41.289> because<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.709> all<00:01:41.829> the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
back of the boat here because of all the

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.730 
back of the boat here because of all the
foam<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.969> all<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.409> supports<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.530> back

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
foam and all the supports of the back

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.569 
foam and all the supports of the back
transom<00:01:45.219> here

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
transom here

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.719 
transom here
so<00:01:46.179> if<00:01:46.299> chose<00:01:46.539> use<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.079> kind<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.439> a<00:01:47.560> screw<00:01:48.189> and

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
so if chose use this kind of a screw and

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.069 
so if chose use this kind of a screw and
make<00:01:48.879> sure<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.149> don't<00:01:49.329> drill<00:01:49.569> too<00:01:49.810> far

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
make sure you don't drill too far

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.160 
make sure you don't drill too far
through<00:01:50.770> all<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:51.280> way<00:01:51.429> just<00:01:51.729> drill<00:01:52.299> partially

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
through all the way just drill partially

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.199 
through all the way just drill partially
because<00:01:53.319> there's<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.649> wooden<00:01:53.829> transom<00:01:54.369> here<00:01:54.549> so

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
because there's a wooden transom here so

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:25.900 
because there's a wooden transom here so
let's<00:01:55.390> get<00:01:55.509> started<00:01:55.869> with<00:01:55.989> that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.870 
all right our tech our motors installed
here<00:02:28.590> there's<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.010> few<00:02:29.220> things<00:02:29.430> left<00:02:29.610> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
here there's just a few things left to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.310 
here there's just a few things left to
do

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
do

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.140 
do
we<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.920> put<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> oil<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:32.940> very

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
we have to put the oil in which is very

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.820 
we have to put the oil in which is very
important<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.780> doesn't<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.170> chipped<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.710> it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
important it doesn't get chipped with it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.550 
important it doesn't get chipped with it
in<00:02:35.030> hook<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> power<00:02:36.450> cable<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
in hook up the power cable to it for the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.430 
in hook up the power cable to it for the
trim<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> electric<00:02:38.730> start<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.960> gas<00:02:40.140> line

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
trim and electric start and the gas line

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.940 
trim and electric start and the gas line
so<00:02:40.770> we'll<00:02:41.250> probably<00:02:41.430> fired<00:02:41.880> up<00:02:42.590> when<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.710> fire

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
so we'll probably fired up when we fire

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.550 
so we'll probably fired up when we fire
the<00:02:44.100> bit<00:02:44.280> motor<00:02:44.490> up<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.290> right<00:02:46.290> now<00:02:46.440> I'm

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the bit motor up and right now I'm

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.590 
the bit motor up and right now I'm
watching<00:02:46.709> Scotty<00:02:47.220> pizza<00:02:47.760> behind<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> camera

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
watching Scotty pizza behind the camera

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.530 
watching Scotty pizza behind the camera
all<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.530> been<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.709> couple<00:02:49.890> days<00:02:50.450> we<00:02:51.450> got

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
all right it's been a couple days we got

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.199 
all right it's been a couple days we got
the<00:02:51.600> oil<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.230> kicker<00:02:52.440> motor<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:54.060> big

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the oil in the kicker motor the big

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.360 
the oil in the kicker motor the big
motor<00:02:54.450> comes<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:54.840> oil<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.680> got<00:02:55.860> these<00:02:56.010> months

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
motor comes with oil we got these months

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.870 
motor comes with oil we got these months
here<00:02:56.690> for<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> both<00:02:58.290> motors<00:02:58.770> always<00:02:59.580> run

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
here for the both motors always run

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.610 
here for the both motors always run
water<00:03:00.180> through<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.570> month<00:03:00.780> never<00:03:01.260> run<00:03:01.530> these

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
water through the month never run these

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.010 
water through the month never run these
things<00:03:01.860> dry<00:03:02.250> we're<00:03:03.090> also<00:03:03.209> required<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.840> big

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
things dry we're also required a big

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.860 
things dry we're also required a big
motor<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.010> let's<00:03:05.400> get<00:03:05.520> started<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
motor up so let's get started it's a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050 
motor up so let's get started it's a
good<00:03:07.020> idea<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.410> pump<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.280> ball<00:03:08.459> prior<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
good idea to pump the ball prior to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.690 
good idea to pump the ball prior to
starting<00:03:09.450> each<00:03:09.959> time<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:11.070> an<00:03:11.190> easier<00:03:11.430> start

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
starting each time it's an easier start

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.060 
starting each time it's an easier start
on<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.880> motor<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.570> also<00:03:13.290> pull<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.530> choke<00:03:13.800> out

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
on the motor and also pull the choke out

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:34.730 
on the motor and also pull the choke out
when<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.370> cold

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.380 

this<00:03:35.280> particular<00:03:35.820> motor<00:03:36.060> here<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:36.360> a

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
this particular motor here is a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.870 
this particular motor here is a
four-stroke<00:03:36.990> motor<00:03:37.340> sometimes<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.520> requires

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
four-stroke motor sometimes it requires

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.030 
four-stroke motor sometimes it requires
a<00:03:38.970> little<00:03:39.210> bit<00:03:39.360> more<00:03:39.450> warmup<00:03:40.110> time<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.830> kind

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
a little bit more warmup time the kind

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.070 
a little bit more warmup time the kind
of<00:03:41.070> cold-blooded<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.360> just<00:03:42.540> keep<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.840> choke

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
of cold-blooded so just keep the choke

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.650 
of cold-blooded so just keep the choke
out<00:03:43.350> there's<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> little<00:03:44.970> button<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.450> side

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
out there's a little button on the side

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.089 
out there's a little button on the side
here<00:03:45.990> for<00:03:46.320> high<00:03:46.470> idle

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.610 

let<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.760> warm<00:03:50.939> up<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.359> or<00:03:51.480> two<00:03:51.510> minutes<00:03:52.230> before

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
let it warm up one or two minutes before

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.229 
let it warm up one or two minutes before
putting<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.099> gear<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.579> should<00:03:53.879> be<00:03:53.969> good<00:03:54.150> to

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
putting it in gear you should be good to

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.449 
putting it in gear you should be good to
go<00:03:54.269> okay<00:03:54.749> now<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.829> start<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.189> bad

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
go okay now I'm going to start this bad

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.289 
go okay now I'm going to start this bad
boy<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:57.299> big<00:03:57.569> Verado<00:03:57.900> here<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:59.400> went<00:04:00.209> ahead

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
boy this big Verado here I went ahead

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.690 
boy this big Verado here I went ahead
and<00:04:00.450> check<00:04:00.749> the<00:04:00.900> oil<00:04:01.010> oil<00:04:02.010> should<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.609> it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
and check the oil oil should be in it

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.009 
and check the oil oil should be in it
from<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.939> factory<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:03.510> always<00:04:03.749> good<00:04:03.989> to

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
from the factory but it's always good to

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.170 
from the factory but it's always good to
double<00:04:04.379> check<00:04:04.409> things<00:04:04.829> like<00:04:05.010> that

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
double check things like that

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.059 
double check things like that
visually<00:04:06.870> checked<00:04:07.139> everything<00:04:07.439> on<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.829> so

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
visually checked everything on it so

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.490 
visually checked everything on it so
let's<00:04:08.760> see<00:04:08.939> if<00:04:09.000> she<00:04:09.120> fires<00:04:09.329> up<00:04:09.629> all<00:04:10.349> right

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
let's see if she fires up all right

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:23.720 
let's see if she fires up all right
we're<00:04:10.650> going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.799> fire<00:04:10.980> this<00:04:11.159> thing<00:04:11.219> up
