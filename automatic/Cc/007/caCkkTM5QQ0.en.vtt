 this is the perished 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.620
 good let's start the link of the download 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.390
 I will leave them in the description of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.090
 video 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.670
 once downloaded they will appear a 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.480
 rar file and we proceed to 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.480
 unzip it 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.420
 ready we will see two folders and a 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.390
 program I will show you one by one the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.090
 first is a magnifying glass this tool we 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 will help to see very small texts between 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.860
 other things observe 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.780
 this is very useful and works 100% 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.030
 to exit the application we 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:35.189
 we go to the taskbar and we 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.189
 we click right and exit 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.299
 and ready we go to the second this serves 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.299
 to place our windows in 3-d 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.850
 I will show you we give you double click ready 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.020
 we click here 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.830
 As you can see, we were put in 3-d to see the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.680
 window we click on it ready here 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.990
 all our content will be 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.780
 leave this application we do the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.600
 same procedure bar 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.020
 tasks right click go out let's go to 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.800
 third and last point this serves to 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:20.230
 put our windows transparent 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.230
 observe how they see they are transparent 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.950
 you can modify the transparency of 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.240
 the windows from the taskbar 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.330

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.800
