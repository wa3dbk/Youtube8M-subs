today we're going to start off with a
simple<00:00:27.539> tutorial<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.350> get<00:00:28.440> you<00:00:28.560> accustomed<00:00:28.860> to

simple tutorial to get you accustomed to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
simple tutorial to get you accustomed to
the<00:00:29.340> file<00:00:29.580> directories<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.300> power<00:00:30.510> grid<00:00:30.780> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the file directories of power grid and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.590 
the file directories of power grid and
weird<00:00:31.320> graphic<00:00:31.770> assets<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.430> stored<00:00:32.700> we'll

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
weird graphic assets are stored we'll

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
weird graphic assets are stored we'll
also<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.989> showing<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.650> make<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> grid

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
also be showing you how to make a grid

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.020 
also be showing you how to make a grid
in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.370> much<00:00:35.700> asked<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.390> landscape<00:00:37.079> mode

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
in the much asked for landscape mode

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
in the much asked for landscape mode
landscape<00:00:39.030> mode<00:00:39.300> isn't<00:00:39.690> an<00:00:39.780> embedded<00:00:40.200> feature

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
landscape mode isn't an embedded feature

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.229 
landscape mode isn't an embedded feature
this<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.130> because<00:00:41.550> making<00:00:41.850> graphics

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
this is because making graphics

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.120 
this is because making graphics
vertically<00:00:42.930> would<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.470> sense<00:00:43.530> rather

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
vertically would make more sense rather

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.190 
vertically would make more sense rather
than<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> limit<00:00:44.730> people's<00:00:45.059> creativity<00:00:45.750> by

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
than to limit people's creativity by

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.049 
than to limit people's creativity by
forcing<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> make<00:00:47.040> both<00:00:47.309> portrait<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
forcing them to make both portrait and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750 
forcing them to make both portrait and
landscape<00:00:48.780> versions<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> their<00:00:49.770> grid<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
landscape versions of their grid so the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.910 
landscape versions of their grid so the
work<00:00:50.880> around<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> simple<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.739> flip

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
work around this is simple just flip

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.970 
work around this is simple just flip
your<00:00:53.040> phone<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.210> grid<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.480> its<00:00:54.660> side

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
your phone and your grid on its side

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
your phone and your grid on its side
make<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> plan<00:00:56.700> your<00:00:56.969> grid<00:00:57.149> before

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
make sure that you plan your grid before

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.690 
make sure that you plan your grid before
you<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.750> started<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.890> also<00:00:59.040> have<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> sheet<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
you get started we also have a sheet you

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.880 
you get started we also have a sheet you
can<00:00:59.969> print<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> sketch<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.860> what

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can print out so you can sketch out what

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.209 
can print out so you can sketch out what
you're<00:01:02.219> trying<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.760> achieve<00:01:03.889> we've<00:01:04.889> provided

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
you're trying to achieve we've provided

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.270 
you're trying to achieve we've provided
some<00:01:05.399> PSD<00:01:06.119> graphic<00:01:06.780> templates<00:01:07.289> and<00:01:07.619> these

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
some PSD graphic templates and these

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
some PSD graphic templates and these
templates<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.539> cells<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:10.079> laid<00:01:10.289> out<00:01:10.319> to<00:01:11.009> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
templates the cells are laid out to the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.129 
templates the cells are laid out to the
correct<00:01:11.429> dimensions<00:01:11.969> so<00:01:12.569> that<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.899> can

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 
correct dimensions so that way you can

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.840 
correct dimensions so that way you can
create<00:01:13.289> your<00:01:13.530> own<00:01:13.590> graphics<00:01:13.979> without<00:01:14.429> having

graphics and landscape like this for
landscape<00:01:50.399> grids<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.999> find<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> easier<00:01:52.169> to<00:01:52.259> work

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
landscape grids I find it easier to work

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.529 
landscape grids I find it easier to work
with<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.709> landscape<00:01:53.219> template<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.029> then

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
with the landscape template and then

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.419 
with the landscape template and then
flip<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.840> 90<00:01:55.289> degrees<00:01:55.649> clockwise<00:01:55.919> or

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
flip it 90 degrees clockwise or

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.029 
flip it 90 degrees clockwise or
anticlockwise<00:01:56.959> that<00:01:57.959> way<00:01:58.109> when<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.380> export<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
anticlockwise that way when I export the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.440 
anticlockwise that way when I export the
buttons<00:01:59.369> they'll<00:01:59.669> be<00:01:59.759> facing<00:01:59.999> the<00:02:00.270> right<00:02:00.419> way

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
buttons they'll be facing the right way

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.379 
buttons they'll be facing the right way
when<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.169> import<00:02:01.349> them<00:02:01.739> into<00:02:01.889> the<00:02:02.099> grid<00:02:02.389> once

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
when I import them into the grid once

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.059 
when I import them into the grid once
I've<00:02:03.539> got<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> style<00:02:04.049> done<00:02:04.319> for<00:02:04.560> each<00:02:04.679> buttons

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
I've got the style done for each buttons

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.570

active state and inactive state I create

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
active state and inactive state I create
two<00:02:08.850> flattened<00:02:09.300> layers<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.259> all<00:02:10.470> the
