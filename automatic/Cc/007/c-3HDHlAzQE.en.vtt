00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
another gotcha the windows mobile device

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.910 
another gotcha the windows mobile device
has<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.150> be<00:03:16.269> using<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.959> Microsoft<00:03:17.530> Bluetooth

has to be using the Microsoft Bluetooth

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.449 
has to be using the Microsoft Bluetooth
stack<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:23.350> know<00:03:23.470> normally<00:03:24.190> wouldn't

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
stack so you know normally wouldn't

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.670 
stack so you know normally wouldn't
think<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.670> was<00:03:24.700> problem<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.330> HTC<00:03:25.840> has<00:03:26.200> decided

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
think I was problem but HTC has decided

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.410 
think I was problem but HTC has decided
to<00:03:26.799> use<00:03:26.950> some<00:03:27.310> other<00:03:27.549> type<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.910> Bluetooth

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
to use some other type of Bluetooth

to use some other type of Bluetooth
stack<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:29.310> their<00:03:30.310> new<00:03:30.489> devices<00:03:30.760> like<00:03:31.060> the

stack on their new devices like the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.160 
stack on their new devices like the
touch<00:03:32.230> pro<00:03:32.440> 2<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.190> hd2<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.510> those<00:03:34.959> will

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
touch pro 2 and the hd2 so those will

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.009 
touch pro 2 and the hd2 so those will
not<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.500> compatible<00:03:35.739> with<00:03:35.980> office<00:03:37.019> 2010
