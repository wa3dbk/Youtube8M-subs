00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
they took that technology and they've

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.910 
they took that technology and they've
really<00:01:52.450> built<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.899> name<00:01:53.140> for<00:01:53.320> themselves<00:01:53.679> and

you're<00:03:52.880> also<00:03:53.030> going<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.240> see<00:03:53.420> nice<00:03:53.720> steel

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
you're also going to see nice steel

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.380 
you're also going to see nice steel
mounted<00:03:54.890> points<00:03:55.280> here<00:03:55.490> which<00:03:55.940> locks<00:03:56.240> the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
mounted points here which locks the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.790

again<00:03:58.340> really<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> nice<00:03:59.060> construction<00:03:59.420> but

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
again really a nice construction but

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.980 
again really a nice construction but
overall<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:01.250> thing<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.760> super<00:04:02.120> light<00:04:02.660> that's

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
overall this thing is super light that's

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.170 
overall this thing is super light that's
what<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.320> really<00:04:03.680> like<00:04:03.830> about<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.820> final

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
what I really like about this the final

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.340 
what I really like about this the final
reason<00:04:05.420> you're<00:04:05.510> going<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:05.690> add<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:06.080> here

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
reason you're going to add this on here

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.310 
reason you're going to add this on here
power<00:04:06.800> upgrades<00:04:07.270> putting<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.390> on<00:04:08.630> no

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
power upgrades putting this on no

power upgrades putting this on no
modifications<00:04:09.980> whatsoever<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.760> slip<00:04:11.000> on

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
modifications whatsoever just a slip on

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.780 
modifications whatsoever just a slip on
nothing<00:04:12.080> else<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.739> get<00:04:12.860> about<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.100> one<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.670> a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
nothing else you get about a one and a

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.210 
nothing else you get about a one and a
half<00:04:13.820> horsepower<00:04:14.750> increase<00:04:15.200> on<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.950> Ninja

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
half horsepower increase on the Ninja

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.340 
half horsepower increase on the Ninja
300<00:04:16.459> again<00:04:17.239> bikes<00:04:17.540> will<00:04:17.750> vary<00:04:17.989> but<00:04:18.169> when<00:04:18.320> I

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
300 again bikes will vary but when I

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.170 
300 again bikes will vary but when I
threw<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:18.709> on<00:04:18.859> here<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.459> was<00:04:19.549> about<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.790> 1<00:04:20.060> and

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
threw this on here it was about a 1 and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.000 
threw this on here it was about a 1 and
1/2<00:04:20.239> horsepower<00:04:20.720> increase<00:04:21.080> from<00:04:21.680> what<00:04:21.859> two

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
1/2 horsepower increase from what two

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.770 
1/2 horsepower increase from what two
brothers<00:04:22.280> was<00:04:22.400> telling<00:04:22.669> us<00:04:22.760> now<00:04:23.210> what<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.660> will

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
brothers was telling us now what I will

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.960 
brothers was telling us now what I will
say<00:04:24.230> it<00:04:24.650> doesn't<00:04:24.800> sound<00:04:25.040> like<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.250> lot<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.820> look

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
say it doesn't sound like a lot you look

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.130 
say it doesn't sound like a lot you look
at<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.210> you're<00:04:26.300> like<00:04:26.360> Spurgeon<00:04:26.810> that's

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
at it and you're like Spurgeon that's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.840 
at it and you're like Spurgeon that's
not<00:04:27.320> really<00:04:27.560> worth<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.890> think<00:04:28.400> about<00:04:28.490> how<00:04:28.700> much

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
not really worth it think about how much

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.100 
not really worth it think about how much
the<00:04:29.000> bike<00:04:29.120> how<00:04:29.360> much<00:04:29.510> power<00:04:29.720> this<00:04:29.900> bike

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
the bike how much power this bike

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.930 
the bike how much power this bike
actually<00:04:30.470> makes<00:04:30.710> this<00:04:31.040> bike<00:04:31.280> makes<00:04:31.520> 35

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
actually makes this bike makes 35

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.909 
actually makes this bike makes 35
horsepower<00:04:32.600> one<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> half<00:04:33.590> horsepower

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
horsepower one and a half horsepower

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:34.450 
horsepower one and a half horsepower
increase

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
increase

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.730 
increase
that's<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.210> three<00:04:35.720> percent<00:04:36.290> gain<00:04:36.710> in

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
that's a three percent gain in

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.100 
that's a three percent gain in
horsepower<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:38.030> maybe<00:04:38.570> that's<00:04:38.780> not<00:04:38.930> enough

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
horsepower so maybe that's not enough

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.170 
horsepower so maybe that's not enough
for<00:04:39.140> you<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.560> want<00:04:39.830> more<00:04:40.100> power<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:40.910> if<00:04:41.030> you're

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
for you you want more power so if you're

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.970 
for you you want more power so if you're
a<00:04:41.210> guy<00:04:41.390> that<00:04:41.600> wants<00:04:41.810> more<00:04:41.960> power<00:04:42.200> you're<00:04:42.830> going

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
a guy that wants more power you're going

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.890 
a guy that wants more power you're going
to<00:04:43.040> want<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.250> consider<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.790> full<00:04:44.000> system<00:04:44.210> now

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
to want to consider the full system now

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.510 
to want to consider the full system now
the<00:04:44.960> full<00:04:45.260> system<00:04:45.470> is<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.860> same<00:04:46.160> muffler

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
the full system is that same muffler

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.010 
the full system is that same muffler
that<00:04:46.640> we've<00:04:46.760> already<00:04:46.910> talked<00:04:47.210> about<00:04:47.450> but<00:04:47.900> you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
that we've already talked about but you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.960 
that we've already talked about but you
get<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:48.320> whole<00:04:48.740> replacement<00:04:49.669> exhaust

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
get this whole replacement exhaust

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.190 
get this whole replacement exhaust
header<00:04:50.240> system<00:04:50.570> as<00:04:50.690> well<00:04:50.810> you're<00:04:51.020> going<00:04:51.110> to

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
header system as well you're going to

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.510 
header system as well you're going to
eliminate<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.620> catalytic<00:04:52.040> converter<00:04:52.100> and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
eliminate the catalytic converter and

you're<00:04:52.880> going<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.030> see<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.300> nice<00:04:53.690> stepped

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
you're going to see this nice stepped

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.280 
you're going to see this nice stepped
design<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.820> those<00:04:56.120> two<00:04:56.390> features<00:04:56.660> allow<00:04:57.230> the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
design so those two features allow the

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.530 
design so those two features allow the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
the whole chamber faster and you get

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.119 
the whole chamber faster and you get
