00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
best way to film at all so that's my

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660 
best way to film at all so that's my
plan<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:24.900> tomorrow<00:02:25.580> unfortunately<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> am

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
plan for tomorrow unfortunately I am

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.600

really because
see<00:02:31.590> there's<00:02:31.770> no<00:02:31.920> space<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.400> film<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:32.940> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
see there's no space to film because I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.880 
see there's no space to film because I
have<00:02:33.600> tables<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> way<00:02:34.680> down<00:02:34.860> here

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
have tables going all the way down here

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920

for<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.670> brick<00:02:35.850> film<00:02:36.060> everything<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
for the brick film everything here is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.350 
for the brick film everything here is
for<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.320> brick<00:02:37.470> film<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> green<00:02:39.120> screen

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
