as common blue fescue and what you're
looking<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> older<00:00:08.700> planting<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
looking at is a older planting here the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.709 
looking at is a older planting here the
first<00:00:10.170> one<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> fresher<00:00:11.389> planting<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
first one was a fresher planting but I

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
first one was a fresher planting but I
like<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.200> represent<00:00:13.410> things<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.250> way<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.400> think

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
like to represent things the way I think

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.550 
like to represent things the way I think
they<00:00:14.910> really<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.240> when<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.719> comes<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.139> plants

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
they really are when it comes to plants

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.400 
they really are when it comes to plants
and<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:17.880> selling<00:00:18.180> them<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.260> be

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and I'm not selling them so I can be

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.590 
and I'm not selling them so I can be
objective<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.180> an<00:00:21.300> older

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
objective here and this is an older

it's<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:24.779> taken<00:00:25.350> during<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> winter<00:00:26.160> in

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it's also taken during the winter in

it's also taken during the winter in
Northern<00:00:27.119> California<00:00:27.500> now<00:00:28.500> we've<00:00:28.769> had<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> lot

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
Northern California now we've had a lot

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.790 
Northern California now we've had a lot
of<00:00:29.369> frost<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.029> year<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> high<00:00:31.349> 20s

of frost this year in the high 20s
Fahrenheit<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.719> these<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:33.870> handling<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
Fahrenheit and these are handling it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.130 
Fahrenheit and these are handling it
fine<00:00:34.469> these<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.190> Hardy<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.239> book<00:00:36.480> says<00:00:36.809> down

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
fine these are Hardy the book says down

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.270 
fine these are Hardy the book says down
to<00:00:37.500> around<00:00:37.620> minus<00:00:38.280> 50<00:00:38.700> degrees<00:00:39.059> Fahrenheit<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
to around minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.930 
to around minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit so
very<00:00:41.280> Hardy<00:00:41.760> evergreen<00:00:42.450> grass<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> what

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
very Hardy evergreen grass and so what

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
very Hardy evergreen grass and so what
you're<00:00:45.059> looking<00:00:45.210> at<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:45.899> older<00:00:46.200> clumps

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you're looking at are some older clumps

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.400 
you're looking at are some older clumps
and<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.520> say<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> plant<00:00:48.480> typically<00:00:49.079> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and they say that the plant typically is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.260 
and they say that the plant typically is
about<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.030> 10<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> 12<00:00:52.050> inches<00:00:52.379> high<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
about you know 10 to 12 inches high and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.380 
about you know 10 to 12 inches high and
10<00:00:54.270> inches<00:00:54.600> wide<00:00:54.899> plus<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.530> minus<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.850> see

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
10 inches wide plus or minus so you see

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.930 
10 inches wide plus or minus so you see
group<00:00:57.660> plantings<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.579> dry

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
group plantings here and a very dry

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.420 
group plantings here and a very dry
planting<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:01.739> rain<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.280> our<00:01:02.370> area

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
planting we do not get rain in our area

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
planting we do not get rain in our area
for<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.600> seven<00:01:04.049> months<00:01:04.379> during<00:01:04.650> the

for a good seven months during the
hottest<00:01:05.220> part<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> year<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.360> low

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
hottest part of the year we have low

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.070 
hottest part of the year we have low
humidity<00:01:06.920> below<00:01:07.920> 20%<00:01:08.369> here's<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.689> looking

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
humidity below 20% here's a good looking

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.609 
humidity below 20% here's a good looking
planting<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.380> here's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
planting by the way and and then here's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
planting by the way and and then here's
winter<00:01:14.070> again<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:15.689> gonna<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:16.049> new

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
winter again so you're gonna get new

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
winter again so you're gonna get new
growth<00:01:16.680> during<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> warmer<00:01:17.790> months<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
growth during the warmer months and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
growth during the warmer months and
you're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.439> silvery

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you're going to get more of that silvery

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.999 
you're going to get more of that silvery
blue<00:01:20.460> color<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.110> people<00:01:22.110> use<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.619> plant

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
blue color that people use this plant

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.179 
blue color that people use this plant
for<00:01:23.340> does<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> fine<00:01:24.869> texture<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> a

for does have that fine texture of a
grass<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> looks

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
grass and you know I think that it looks

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
grass and you know I think that it looks
a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.659> rough<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.829> give<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
a little rough when you don't give it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.910 
a little rough when you don't give it
moisture<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> good-looking<00:01:34.079> photo<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
saw earlier that's located in Berkeley

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
saw earlier that's located in Berkeley

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the drier months and also looks its best

during<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> warmer<00:02:08.759> months<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.090> it's

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
during the warmer months because it's

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.100 
during the warmer months because it's
growing

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.490

I<00:02:11.420> have<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.629> grown<00:02:12.989> this

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I have not grown this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.760 
I have not grown this
I've<00:02:13.770> never<00:02:14.010> loved<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.330> I'm<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.110> sure<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I've never loved it so I'm not sure the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.100 
I've never loved it so I'm not sure the
best<00:02:17.070> way<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.850> looking<00:02:18.300> its<00:02:18.450> best<00:02:18.840> in

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
best way to get it looking its best in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
best way to get it looking its best in
the<00:02:19.230> warmer<00:02:19.560> months<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:20.010> would<00:02:20.340> say<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:21.240> a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
the warmer months I would say it's a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.020 
the warmer months I would say it's a
good<00:02:21.630> idea<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.290> try<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.620> kind<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.040> share<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
good idea to try and kind of share this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.480 
good idea to try and kind of share this
a<00:02:24.090> little<00:02:24.420> lower<00:02:24.780> maybe<00:02:25.230> half<00:02:25.620> its<00:02:25.860> height<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
a little lower maybe half its height and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.760 
a little lower maybe half its height and
encourage<00:02:27.390> some<00:02:27.660> new<00:02:27.870> growth<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.470> maybe<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
encourage some new growth and maybe a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.670 
encourage some new growth and maybe a
little<00:02:29.130> fertilizer<00:02:29.400> there<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.870> spring<00:02:31.320> to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
little fertilizer there in the spring to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.220 
little fertilizer there in the spring to
push<00:02:32.070> out<00:02:32.280> some<00:02:32.310> new<00:02:32.790> silvery<00:02:33.300> blue<00:02:33.630> growth<00:02:33.960> I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
push out some new silvery blue growth I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.050 
push out some new silvery blue growth I
think<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> foliage<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.460> attractive

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
think the foliage is really attractive

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.080 
think the foliage is really attractive
when<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.360> looking<00:02:36.540> its<00:02:36.870> best<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
when it's looking its best and so I

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.730 
when it's looking its best and so I
think<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.540> you're<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> use<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.410> just

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
think if you're going to use that just

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.310 
think if you're going to use that just
keep<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.820> mind<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.570> know<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.140> that's

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
keep that in mind and know that that's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.740 
keep that in mind and know that that's
how<00:02:43.560> you're<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.280> best<00:02:44.750> best

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
how you're going to get the best best
