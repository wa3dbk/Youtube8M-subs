00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.960
 remember in one song it was sung not to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.240
 I had to beloved cry harder for 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 steering wheel hold driver 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.169
 touch so here we add choose 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.749
 reliable tires cheese hello my name is 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:25.130
 the novel is express bus and today I 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.839
 I will tell about the reliable tire for distant 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.230
 commercial meals to not have to 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:36.750
 love a different plan tyler cargospeed winter 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 this tire is designed for easy 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.450
 commercial freight transport and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.090
 minibuses are soft and not noisy it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.570
 Yugoslav tire can make any 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.570
 your business trip is pleasant and reliable 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.170
 any cargo should be approached 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.180
 responsibly therefore cargospeed winter 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.090
 especially hard for long-term 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.670
 load is worth only double 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.039
 steel cord he saves the tire from 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.590
 mechanical damage and creates 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:15.810
 rather high deformation threshold this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.609
 tire is perfect for long 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.880
 trips and large kilometer same 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.719
 road holding on the winter road 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.719
 provides directional drawing 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.299
 tread and very wide central 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.909
 edge which consists of two rows 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.109
 powerful drafts for rectilinear motion 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:40.170
 on rolled snow and wet asphalt 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:42.090
 that's so perfect with quick wear when 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.359
 high loads fights form 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.100
 tread she's a many radius that 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.889
 provides uniform distribution 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.990
 pressure inside the tread that in its 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.389
 queue leads to an increase in time 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.229
 services however don't hope here 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:02:00.420
 for a miracle tire works hope but 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.939
 nothing lasts forever also 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.409
 remember that a lot depends on 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.409
 nature of operation 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.630
 due to the silicon content in the rubber 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 mixture tire well clings to the ice and not 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.020
 dubeet 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.060
 increase in the area Lamy tion of lead 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.340
 to more confident tire behavior on 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.770
 ice three longitudinal channels of different 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.450
 profile and small grooves extending from them 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.220
 effectively fights automatic transmission 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 planning well and spikes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.260
 maybe a bruise and I would say that here 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.170
 at least spikes zalet they of course 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.170
 cling but leave without saying goodbye 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.700
 Perhaps we can conclude that tiger 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.880
 cargospeed winter 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 tire for winter knurled track 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.970
 fresh snow and thaw will not let porridge 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.070
 the whole exit well, leave the ice to others with 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.690
 you had an affair before meeting next 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.690
