00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
through a primer pump over here then it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
through a primer pump over here then it
goes<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.980> main<00:00:50.160> spin<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.700> filter<00:00:51.149> over

goes to the main spin on filter over

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
goes to the main spin on filter over
here<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.860> changing<00:00:53.280> those<00:00:53.430> as

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
here I'm going to be changing those as

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.959 
here I'm going to be changing those as
well<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.410> feeds<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.890> feeds<00:00:56.670> into

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
well and then it feeds and feeds into

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
well and then it feeds and feeds into
the<00:00:57.300> injection<00:00:57.780> system<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> injection<00:00:58.829> pump

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the injection system the injection pump

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
the injection system the injection pump
and<00:00:59.539> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.949> injectors<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.300> then<00:01:03.300> you've<00:01:03.480> got

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and to the injectors and then you've got

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560 
and to the injectors and then you've got
these<00:01:04.339> hoses<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.760> run<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> between<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
these hoses that run in between the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
these hoses that run in between the
injectors<00:01:07.020> those<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.560> fuel<00:01:07.890> return

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
injectors those are your fuel return

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.480 
injectors those are your fuel return
hoses<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.810> come<00:01:10.049> back<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
hoses they come back through here and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
hoses they come back through here and
then<00:01:11.640> through<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.150> cigar<00:01:12.510> hose<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
then through this cigar hose back to the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
then through this cigar hose back to the
tank<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.810> that's<00:01:15.810> basically<00:01:16.340> how<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> fuel

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
tank so that's basically how the fuel

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810 
tank so that's basically how the fuel
system<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.509> set<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.259> vehicle<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.610> now

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
system is set up on this vehicle so now

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.490 
system is set up on this vehicle so now
we're<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.270> ahead<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.900> disconnect

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
we're going to go ahead and disconnect

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.210 
we're going to go ahead and disconnect
the<00:01:22.770> lines<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.659> connect<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.170> our

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
the lines and connect them up to our

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.630 
the lines and connect them up to our
plastic<00:01:26.220> bottle<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:28.520> perform<00:01:29.520> our

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
plastic bottle so that we perform our

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.539 
plastic bottle so that we perform our
diesel<00:01:29.880> purge<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
diesel purge so we're going to do is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.020 
diesel purge so we're going to do is
disconnect<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:38.720> cigar<00:01:40.310> toes<00:01:41.310> which<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.909> our

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
disconnect the cigar toes which is our

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.860 
disconnect the cigar toes which is our

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.930 

okay<00:01:51.980> and<00:01:52.980> then<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.550> going<00:01:53.730> to<00:01:53.790> go

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
okay and then that that's going to go

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.930 
okay and then that that's going to go
over<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.420> top<00:01:54.690> of<00:01:54.870> this<00:01:54.990> bottle<00:01:55.940> just

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
over to the top of this bottle just

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.390 
over to the top of this bottle just
going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> let<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.330> sit<00:01:57.720> there<00:01:57.900> for<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.140> moment

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.969 

and<00:02:02.400> then<00:02:02.520> we're<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> disconnect<00:02:03.150> our

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
and then we're going to disconnect our

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
and then we're going to disconnect our
intake<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.910> into<00:02:09.330> our

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
intake and that's going to go into our

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.570 
intake and that's going to go into our
piece<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> hose<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.310> over<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:13.580> so

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
piece of hose that we have over here so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.100 
piece of hose that we have over here so
this<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> fairly<00:02:15.180> simple<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.050> very

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
this is a fairly simple but very

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.410 
this is a fairly simple but very
effective<00:02:16.680> process<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:19.400> purging<00:02:20.420> system

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
effective process of purging system

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.510 
effective process of purging system
cleaning<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.470> injectors<00:02:24.410> getting<00:02:25.489> rid<00:02:26.489> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
cleaning the injectors getting rid of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.460 
cleaning the injectors getting rid of
years<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.209> buildup<00:02:27.630> okay<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.140> I've<00:02:28.440> got

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
years of buildup okay so I've got

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.410 
years of buildup okay so I've got
