of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.790> housing<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> bit<00:00:16.609> uninformed

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
of the housing I was a bit uninformed

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.070 
of the housing I was a bit uninformed
about<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.180> lot<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> things<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.869> this

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
about a lot of the things about this

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.359 
about a lot of the things about this
device<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> had<00:00:20.010> no<00:00:20.310> idea<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.720> home<00:00:21.900> flex

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369

device so I had no idea the home flex
ran<00:00:23.369> behind<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.380> LCD<00:00:26.449> through<00:00:27.449> there<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.019> tore

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
ran behind the LCD through there so tore

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.179 
ran behind the LCD through there so tore
through<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> pretty<00:00:28.859> easily

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
through that pretty easily

splitter when I was lifting the LCD out

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.000 
splitter when I was lifting the LCD out
did<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:32.520> adhesive<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
did not know there's adhesive on the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
did not know there's adhesive on the
back<00:00:35.010> plate<00:00:35.750> but<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.020> these<00:00:37.110> pink

back plate but that's what these pink
spots<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.399> adhesive<00:00:39.090> strips<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
spots are was your adhesive strips and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
spots are was your adhesive strips and
then<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.860> course<00:00:40.890> you've<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.250> adhesive<00:00:41.850> on

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
then of course you've got adhesive on

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
then of course you've got adhesive on
the<00:00:42.090> side<00:00:42.300> rails<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.840> top<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> bottom<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the side rails the top and the bottom so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
the side rails the top and the bottom so
a<00:00:44.460> lot<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> heat<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.410> stingy<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
a lot of heat don't be stingy with the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.229 
a lot of heat don't be stingy with the
heat<00:00:47.250> give<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.030> got

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
heat give it all you got

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.930 
heat give it all you got
I<00:00:48.539> stuck<00:00:49.289> my<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.649> hot<00:00:49.800> plate<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.370> used

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I stuck my on the hot plate and used

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
I stuck my on the hot plate and used
wire<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.050> cut<00:00:52.230> through<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
wire to cut through it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.340 
wire to cut through it
started<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> bottom<00:00:54.149> away<00:00:54.750> from<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> flex

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
started at the bottom away from the flex

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
started at the bottom away from the flex
cable<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.129> shimmied<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.690> with

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
cable and shimmied all the way up with

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.160 
cable and shimmied all the way up with
the<00:00:57.930> wire<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.090> did<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.780> pretty<00:01:01.079> much

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the wire and that did it is pretty much

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959 
the wire and that did it is pretty much
it<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.680> there's<00:01:02.190> nothing<00:01:02.520> too<00:01:02.699> crazy

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it right there there's nothing too crazy

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.160 
it right there there's nothing too crazy
about<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.739> I'd<00:01:04.739> say<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> only<00:01:06.170> obvious

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
about it I'd say the only obvious

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.510 
about it I'd say the only obvious
difference<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> fact<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
difference would be the fact that the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
difference would be the fact that the
LCD<00:01:11.520> fold<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:13.490> or<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.509> way<00:01:15.780> he<00:01:15.930> depending<00:01:16.229> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
LCD fold up or this way he depending on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
LCD fold up or this way he depending on
which<00:01:16.409> way<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.700> not

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
which way you're going about it it's not

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
which way you're going about it it's not
gonna<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.420> though<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.080> want<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
gonna go this way though I don't want to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
gonna go this way though I don't want to
do<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:20.060> they're<00:01:21.060> pretty<00:01:21.360> strong

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
do that they're pretty strong

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.149 
do that they're pretty strong
considering<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.439> thin<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:22.860> though

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
considering how thin they are though

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.179 
considering how thin they are though
because<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.630> gentle<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.470> upon

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
because I was not gentle with it upon

the where the adhesive strips are that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760 
the where the adhesive strips are that
should<00:01:53.399> probably<00:01:53.640> make<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> easier<00:01:54.770> here's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
should probably make it easier here's

should probably make it easier here's
the<00:01:55.979> home<00:01:56.189> button<00:01:56.490> nice<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> torn<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.899> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and that goes right in there or rather

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.070 
and that goes right in there or rather
will<00:02:06.910> place<00:02:07.480> it<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.810> bottom<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.009> wire

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
will place it on the bottom so that wire

will place it on the bottom so that wire
runs<00:02:12.450> right<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:13.870> into<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.440> phone<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:16.500> it's

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
runs right here into the phone and it's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.110 
runs right here into the phone and it's
where<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.740> adhesive<00:02:17.860> strips<00:02:18.370> are<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.970> that's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
where the adhesive strips are so that's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.560 
where the adhesive strips are so that's
all<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> felt<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:21.060> yeah<00:02:22.060> went<00:02:22.360> right<00:02:22.540> through

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
all I felt and yeah went right through

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.420 
all I felt and yeah went right through
it<00:02:22.870> really<00:02:23.650> easily<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.630> can<00:02:25.810> slowly

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
it really easily so if you can slowly

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.570 
it really easily so if you can slowly
from<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.490> bottom<00:02:27.910> right<00:02:28.090> side<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.570> phone

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
from the bottom right side of the phone

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.210 
from the bottom right side of the phone
once<00:02:30.580> you've<00:02:30.760> gotten<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.420> adhesive<00:02:32.220> loosened

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
once you've gotten the adhesive loosened

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.740 
once you've gotten the adhesive loosened
from<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> bottom<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.180> side<00:02:34.360> rails<00:02:34.630> on

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
from the bottom and the side rails on

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.350 
from the bottom and the side rails on
the<00:02:34.810> top<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:36.010> could<00:02:36.220> just<00:02:36.459> sort<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.820> fill<00:02:37.180> your

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the top you could just sort of fill your

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.490 
the top you could just sort of fill your
way<00:02:37.510> along<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.440> adhesive<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:40.080> once<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.230> stop

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
way along the adhesive and once you stop

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.470 
way along the adhesive and once you stop
feeling<00:02:41.770> resistance<00:02:42.430> from<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.820> adhesive<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
feeling resistance from the adhesive you

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.090 
feeling resistance from the adhesive you
can<00:02:43.660> let<00:02:43.870> up<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.380> could<00:02:44.530> probably<00:02:44.740> keep

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
can let up and you could probably keep

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.250 
can let up and you could probably keep
that<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.490> capable<00:02:45.820> safe<00:02:46.180> pretty<00:02:46.600> easily<00:02:46.690> that

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
that in capable safe pretty easily that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.920 
that in capable safe pretty easily that
flex<00:02:48.160> cable<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.970> then<00:02:49.180> from<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.480> opposite

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
flex cable and then from the opposite

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.280 
flex cable and then from the opposite
side<00:02:50.170> again<00:02:51.330> maybe<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.630> try<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.930> fill<00:02:53.170> out

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
side again maybe just try to fill out

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.330 
side again maybe just try to fill out
that<00:02:53.410> resistance<00:02:53.890> because<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.220> pretty

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
that resistance because it's pretty

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.340 
that resistance because it's pretty
sticky<00:02:54.760> stuff<00:02:55.030> you'll<00:02:55.780> definitely<00:02:56.170> feel<00:02:56.320> it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
sticky stuff you'll definitely feel it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.800 
sticky stuff you'll definitely feel it
going<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.680> there<00:02:59.700> other<00:03:00.700> than<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.330> think

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
going in there other than that I think

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.210 
going in there other than that I think
lunch<00:03:02.020> repairs<00:03:02.320> are<00:03:02.500> gonna<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.770> very<00:03:03.010> very

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
lunch repairs are gonna be very very

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.820 
lunch repairs are gonna be very very
simple<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.940> not<00:03:04.450> complicated<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:05.440> don't<00:03:05.709> have

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
simple and not complicated I don't have

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.040 
simple and not complicated I don't have
any<00:03:05.950> lenses<00:03:06.310> here<00:03:06.700> or<00:03:06.910> else<00:03:07.090> I'd<00:03:07.360> do<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> look<00:03:07.900> at

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
any lenses here or else I'd do a look at

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.150 
any lenses here or else I'd do a look at
demonstration<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.489> might<00:03:10.709> refer<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.980> this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.280 
demonstration but I might refer to this
clean<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.120> adhere<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.959> post

replacement<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:22.090> know<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.420> can't

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
replacement you know I really can't

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.790 
replacement you know I really can't
think<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.810> anything<00:03:22.989> too<00:03:23.170> crazy<00:03:23.350> about<00:03:23.500> this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
think of anything too crazy about this

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.870 
think of anything too crazy about this
the<00:03:24.190> once<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.150> wire<00:03:25.330> goes<00:03:25.690> through<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.700> top

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the once the wire goes through the top

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.090 
the once the wire goes through the top
portion<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:29.019> might<00:03:29.200> want<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.470> let<00:03:29.590> up<00:03:29.769> on<00:03:29.950> it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
portion you might want to let up on it

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.460 
portion you might want to let up on it
because<00:03:30.310> your<00:03:30.820> flex<00:03:31.239> cable<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
because your flex cable for the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.009 
because your flex cable for the
digitizer<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.489> right<00:03:33.760> there<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.570> does<00:03:34.810> pop

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
digitizer is right there and it does pop

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.410 
digitizer is right there and it does pop
up<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.470> bit<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:36.519> does<00:03:36.700> have<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.910> bit<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.209> hump

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
up a bit it does have a bit of a hump

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
might be the inverter I'm not too sure

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.060 
might be the inverter I'm not too sure
maybe<00:03:49.780> that's<00:03:50.049> totally<00:03:50.350> wrong<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.650> know<00:03:50.799> that's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
maybe that's totally wrong I know that's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.699 
maybe that's totally wrong I know that's
what<00:03:51.160> I've<00:03:51.250> always<00:03:51.310> called<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.239> I<00:03:52.480> do<00:03:53.470> know

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
what I've always called it so I do know

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.780 
what I've always called it so I do know
that<00:03:53.830> if<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.950> break<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.489> get<00:03:54.610> color

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
that if you break that you get color

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.770 
that if you break that you get color
issues<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.709> then<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.519> tried<00:03:57.850> going<00:03:58.150> at<00:03:58.570> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
issues and then I tried going at the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.720 
issues and then I tried going at the
corners<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.500> razor<00:03:59.680> blade<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.070> this

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
corners of a razor blade and this

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.869 
corners of a razor blade and this
that's<00:04:01.060> how<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.180> start<00:04:01.540> my<00:04:01.569> s4<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:03.370> go<00:04:03.580> through

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
that's how I start my s4 you go through

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.210 
that's how I start my s4 you go through
I<00:04:04.239> usually<00:04:04.900> just<00:04:05.050> use<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.410> metal<00:04:05.769> razor<00:04:05.920> blade

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
I usually just use a metal razor blade

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.860 
I usually just use a metal razor blade
and<00:04:06.489> separate<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.030> corners<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.390> bit<00:04:07.599> get<00:04:07.750> it

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
and separate the corners a bit get it

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.339 
and separate the corners a bit get it
loosened<00:04:08.110> up<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:10.540> did<00:04:10.690> not<00:04:10.780> work<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:13.349> felt

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
loosened up that did not work I felt

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.190 
loosened up that did not work I felt
like<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.620> was<00:04:14.709> gonna<00:04:14.830> break<00:04:15.040> at<00:04:15.220> any<00:04:15.370> second<00:04:15.849> so

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
like I was gonna break at any second so
