00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
think there's a lot of myths about them

that<00:00:35.040> people<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> bit<00:00:36.270> confused<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.590> yeah<00:00:37.800> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
thought that that would probably be the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.760 
thought that that would probably be the
best<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> do<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> show<00:00:40.710> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
exactly how they put the extensions in

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040 
exactly how they put the extensions in
which<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.270> quite<00:03:40.450> interesting<00:03:40.840> because<00:03:40.960> even

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
which is quite interesting because even

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.840 
which is quite interesting because even
myself<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.770> didn't<00:03:41.950> really<00:03:42.130> understand<00:03:42.520> how<00:03:42.580> it

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
myself I didn't really understand how it

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.310 
myself I didn't really understand how it
worked<00:03:43.060> because<00:03:43.270> I<00:03:43.450> only<00:03:43.630> ever<00:03:43.960> see<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.230> from

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
worked because I only ever see it from

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.140 
worked because I only ever see it from
the<00:03:44.410> front<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.220> yeah<00:03:45.370> now<00:03:45.550> you<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.820> see<00:03:46.000> how

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
the front so yeah now you can see how

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.610 
the front so yeah now you can see how
there's<00:03:46.360> no<00:03:46.480> glue<00:03:46.720> involved<00:03:47.140> nothing<00:03:47.290> like

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
there's no glue involved nothing like

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.290 
there's no glue involved nothing like
that<00:03:47.830> it's<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.550> quite<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.730> simple<00:03:49.120> procedure

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
that it's just quite a simple procedure

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300 
that it's just quite a simple procedure
and<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.200> next<00:03:50.380> clip<00:03:50.590> Sarah<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.220> will

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
and in the next clip Sarah and will

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.650 
and in the next clip Sarah and will
explain<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.700> little<00:03:51.820> bit<00:03:52.000> more<00:03:52.240> to<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.510> about

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
explain a little bit more to you about

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.360 
explain a little bit more to you about
how<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.080> done<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.710> how<00:03:53.860> do<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.070> keep<00:03:54.190> them

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
how it's done so how do you keep them

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.930 
how it's done so how do you keep them
from<00:03:54.520> like<00:03:54.730> ruining<00:03:55.090> my<00:03:55.240> hair<00:03:55.510> each<00:03:55.900> other<00:03:56.110> and

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
from like ruining my hair each other and

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.310 
from like ruining my hair each other and
most<00:03:57.940> important<00:03:58.570> is<00:03:58.720> when<00:03:59.050> you're<00:03:59.200> getting

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
most important is when you're getting

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.350 
most important is when you're getting
money<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.680> get<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.040> right<00:04:00.190> size<00:04:00.610> sections

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
money to get the right size sections

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.340 
money to get the right size sections
also<00:04:02.170> we<00:04:02.860> have<00:04:03.130> different<00:04:03.550> size<00:04:03.700> rates<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.570> so

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
also we have different size rates and so

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.110 
also we have different size rates and so
for<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.860> got<00:04:06.070> dense<00:04:06.460> hair<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:07.000> it's

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
for you you got dense hair but it's

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.460 
for you you got dense hair but it's
actually<00:04:07.390> quite<00:04:07.480> fine<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:08.020> I<00:04:08.080> wouldn't<00:04:08.350> use

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
actually quite fine so I wouldn't use

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.320 
actually quite fine so I wouldn't use
like<00:04:08.770> anything<00:04:09.280> large<00:04:09.520> with<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.730> medium<00:04:10.120> sized

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
like anything large with a medium sized

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.960 
like anything large with a medium sized
ring<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:11.230> get<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.530> ring<00:04:11.680> size<00:04:11.920> right<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.790> then

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
ring so get the ring size right and then

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.760 
ring so get the ring size right and then
the<00:04:13.210> sections<00:04:13.750> need<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.020> be<00:04:14.140> deep<00:04:14.380> u-shaped

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
the sections need to be deep u-shaped

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.340 
the sections need to be deep u-shaped
sections<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.750> kind<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.020> the<00:04:17.140> weight

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
sections and this is kind of the weight

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.520 
sections and this is kind of the weight
is<00:04:17.680> distributed<00:04:18.100> evenly<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.870> sits<00:04:20.230> like

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
is distributed evenly and it sits like

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.350 
is distributed evenly and it sits like
against<00:04:21.010> your<00:04:21.130> head<00:04:21.310> doesn't<00:04:21.880> move<00:04:22.030> too<00:04:22.330> much

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
against your head doesn't move too much

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.070

can't have a full head otherwise you

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.419 
can't have a full head otherwise you
could<00:04:55.199> get<00:04:55.289> all<00:04:55.409> dodgy<00:04:55.739> hair<00:04:56.009> extensions

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:56.429 
could get all dodgy hair extensions

could get all dodgy hair extensions
showing<00:04:56.639> which<00:04:56.819> we<00:04:56.999> don't<00:04:57.209> want<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:58.049> they

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
showing which we don't want so they

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.749 
showing which we don't want so they
leave<00:04:58.409> it<00:04:58.469> open<00:04:58.649> and<00:04:59.159> I<00:04:59.249> think<00:04:59.309> about<00:04:59.579> all

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
leave it open and I think about all

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.009 
leave it open and I think about all
those<00:04:59.849> different<00:05:00.029> things<00:05:00.239> to<00:05:00.569> make<00:05:00.719> sure<00:05:00.749> that

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.019 
those different things to make sure that

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.479

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
in a brush offer which some sounds down

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.529 
in a brush offer which some sounds down
and<00:05:10.679> this<00:05:11.159> is<00:05:11.339> where<00:05:11.489> as<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:11.849> can<00:05:11.879> see<00:05:12.179> the<00:05:12.360> top

of my blonde extensions is blonde

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:15.559 
of my blonde extensions is blonde
obviously<00:05:14.909> because<00:05:15.059> that's<00:05:15.179> the<00:05:15.299> color<00:05:15.419> of

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
obviously because that's the color of

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.169 
obviously because that's the color of
the<00:05:15.659> hair<00:05:15.839> so<00:05:16.439> what<00:05:16.649> they<00:05:16.769> do<00:05:16.829> is<00:05:17.339> they<00:05:17.729> go<00:05:17.909> back

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:18.179 
the hair so what they do is they go back

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:19.850 
the hair so what they do is they go back

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.249 
with the brown hair dye that they've
used<00:05:19.889> on<00:05:20.189> the<00:05:20.309> rest<00:05:20.489> of<00:05:20.669> my<00:05:20.789> hair<00:05:21.029> and<00:05:21.259> create

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
used on the rest of my hair and create

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.069 
used on the rest of my hair and create
like<00:05:22.379> this<00:05:22.529> lovely<00:05:23.009> blend<00:05:23.339> so<00:05:24.299> that<00:05:24.509> the<00:05:24.749> hair

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:25.079 
like this lovely blend so that the hair

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:27.409 
like this lovely blend so that the hair
extensions<00:05:25.589> kind<00:05:25.949> of<00:05:26.009> blend<00:05:26.610> seamlessly<00:05:26.909> and

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
extensions kind of blend seamlessly and

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.569 
extensions kind of blend seamlessly and
you<00:05:27.509> don't<00:05:27.719> see<00:05:27.959> them<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.619> it<00:05:29.039> just<00:05:29.309> gives<00:05:29.489> it

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:29.579 
you don't see them and it just gives it

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.399 
you don't see them and it just gives it
a<00:05:29.669> really<00:05:29.939> bright<00:05:30.360> professional<00:05:31.019> natural

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
a really bright professional natural

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.739 
a really bright professional natural
finish<00:05:31.799> and<00:05:32.069> I<00:05:32.519> think<00:05:32.789> it's<00:05:32.909> very<00:05:33.149> important

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:33.749 
finish and I think it's very important

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:35.089 
finish and I think it's very important
to<00:05:34.019> get<00:05:34.139> that<00:05:34.289> kind<00:05:34.499> of<00:05:34.619> finish<00:05:34.919> with

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
to get that kind of finish with

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.409 
to get that kind of finish with
extensions<00:05:35.669> because<00:05:35.879> you<00:05:35.969> just<00:05:36.179> don't<00:05:36.329> want

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
extensions because you just don't want

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.419 
extensions because you just don't want
them<00:05:36.629> looking<00:05:36.719> fake<00:05:37.169> and<00:05:37.469> that's<00:05:38.189> the<00:05:38.339> other

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:38.429 
them looking fake and that's the other

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:39.799 
them looking fake and that's the other
thing<00:05:38.549> as<00:05:38.759> well<00:05:38.909> as<00:05:39.029> when<00:05:39.179> you<00:05:39.299> take<00:05:39.479> them<00:05:39.629> back

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:39.809 
thing as well as when you take them back

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.119 
thing as well as when you take them back
you've<00:05:40.019> got<00:05:40.199> your<00:05:40.319> own<00:05:40.439> kind<00:05:40.709> of<00:05:40.799> hair<00:05:40.979> which

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
you've got your own kind of hair which

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.429 
you've got your own kind of hair which
is<00:05:41.159> especially<00:05:41.909> just<00:05:42.269> for<00:05:42.449> your<00:05:42.629> head<00:05:42.839> and

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:43.439 
is especially just for your head and

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.019 
is especially just for your head and
it's<00:05:43.649> a<00:05:43.709> little<00:05:43.860> bit<00:05:44.009> extra<00:05:44.519> cost<00:05:44.759> but<00:05:44.849> it's

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
it's a little bit extra cost but it's

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.269 
it's a little bit extra cost but it's
only<00:05:45.179> about<00:05:45.389> 90<00:05:45.929> pounds<00:05:46.079> so<00:05:46.319> it's<00:05:46.439> not<00:05:46.499> too<00:05:46.860> bad

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:47.279 
only about 90 pounds so it's not too bad

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.399 
only about 90 pounds so it's not too bad
and<00:05:47.610> it's<00:05:47.969> definitely<00:05:48.239> worth<00:05:48.449> doing<00:05:48.899> as<00:05:49.079> I<00:05:49.229> say

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
and it's definitely worth doing as I say

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.439 
and it's definitely worth doing as I say
because<00:05:49.589> it<00:05:49.829> makes<00:05:50.519> your<00:05:50.699> hair<00:05:50.849> look<00:05:50.879> extra

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
because it makes your hair look extra
