00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
on the single chain drives I got this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
on the single chain drives I got this
pedal<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.170> considering

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
pedal because I was considering

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.019 
pedal because I was considering
different<00:00:22.859> brands<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.580> I'll<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.850> more

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
different brands you know I'll have more

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.599 
different brands you know I'll have more
expensive<00:00:24.510> brands<00:00:24.779> less<00:00:25.050> expensive<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.070> even

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
expensive brands less expensive I even

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.099 
expensive brands less expensive I even
looked<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.849> some<00:00:27.029> single<00:00:27.359> chain<00:00:27.599> drive<00:00:27.840> which

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
looked at some single chain drive which

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
looked at some single chain drive which
I<00:00:28.380> don't<00:00:29.220> recommend<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.760> you're<00:00:29.880> an<00:00:29.970> advanced

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
I don't recommend if you're an advanced

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.999 
I don't recommend if you're an advanced
drummer<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.779> becoming<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.500> advanced<00:00:31.740> drummer

drummer or becoming an advanced drummer

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.639 
drummer or becoming an advanced drummer
but<00:00:32.940> they<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.140> good<00:00:34.260> single

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
but they do make some really good single

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
but they do make some really good single
chain<00:00:34.890> drives<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:35.399> days

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
chain drives these days

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.590 
chain drives these days
unlike<00:00:36.690> pearl<00:00:36.930> makes<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.600> so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
unlike pearl makes a good one and so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
unlike pearl makes a good one and so
does<00:00:39.750> DW<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:41.790> moving<00:00:41.879> up

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
does DW but you know if you're moving up

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
does DW but you know if you're moving up
you<00:00:42.270> want<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> probably<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.110> least<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> DW

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
you want to probably get at least the DW

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.580 
you want to probably get at least the DW
3000<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.879> 5000<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.840> even<00:00:46.559> more

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
3000 or the 5000 which is even more

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.310 
3000 or the 5000 which is even more
expensive<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.660> read<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.809> reviews<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
expensive but I read some reviews on a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.880 
expensive but I read some reviews on a
DW<00:00:50.070> 5000<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.449> some<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> drummer<00:00:52.559> said

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
DW 5000 and some of the drummer said

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670 
DW 5000 and some of the drummer said
they<00:00:52.980> couldn't<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> difference<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
they couldn't see a difference the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
they couldn't see a difference the
significant<00:00:56.250> difference<00:00:56.640> between<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.539> 3000

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
significant difference between the 3000

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
significant difference between the 3000
and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> 5000<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.270> anyway<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.420> good

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and the 5000 so anyway that was good

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.220 
and the 5000 so anyway that was good
enough<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.899> me

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
enough for me

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.030 
enough for me
and<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> DW<00:01:02.670> 3000<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:04.470> action<00:01:04.920> on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and I got the DW 3000 so the action on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
and I got the DW 3000 so the action on
it<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.369> great<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> box<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.140> couldn't

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
it is great out of the box I couldn't

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
it is great out of the box I couldn't
believe<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.010> had<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> make<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.570> minor

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
believe it I had to make just one minor

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
believe it I had to make just one minor
adjustment<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.460> wasn't<00:01:11.610> even

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
adjustment which probably wasn't even

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.310 
adjustment which probably wasn't even
necessary<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.270> when<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.360> buy<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.140> do

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
necessary so the when you buy it you do

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
necessary so the when you buy it you do
get<00:01:17.810> two<00:01:18.810> beaters<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> felt<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.250> plastic

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
get two beaters with a felt in a plastic

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.179 
get two beaters with a felt in a plastic
tip<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.560> fine<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.770> regular

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
tip which is just fine for regular

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.719 
tip which is just fine for regular
acoustic<00:01:23.580> drums<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.280> electric

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
acoustic drums but not on an electric

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
acoustic drums but not on an electric
drum<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.360> can't<00:01:27.600> use<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
drum because you can't use where you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
drum because you can't use where you
shouldn't<00:01:28.650> lose<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> felt<00:01:29.340> tip<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
shouldn't lose the felt tip because it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.030 
shouldn't lose the felt tip because it
wears<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> mesh<00:01:31.079> head<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.530> electric

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
wears out the mesh head on electric

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.140 
wears out the mesh head on electric
Trump's<00:01:32.400> which<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> TD<00:01:33.780> 30<00:01:34.049> kV<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:35.150> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Trump's which I have a TD 30 kV here and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
Trump's which I have a TD 30 kV here and
by<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.680> reason<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.159> using

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
by the way the reason I'm not using

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.560 
by the way the reason I'm not using
these<00:01:38.490> also<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> can't<00:01:39.450> adjust

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
these also is because you can't adjust

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.920 
these also is because you can't adjust
the<00:01:39.869> head<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> plastic<00:01:41.250> side<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.930> that's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the head for the plastic side so that's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
the head for the plastic side so that's
why<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> iron<00:01:44.579> Cobra<00:01:45.090> wood<00:01:46.250> beaters

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
why I have the iron Cobra wood beaters

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
why I have the iron Cobra wood beaters
because<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.149> adjust<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.659> head<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> hit

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because you can adjust the head to hit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
because you can adjust the head to hit
flat<00:01:49.439> against<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> surface<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> bass

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
flat against the surface of the bass

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
flat against the surface of the bass
drum<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> mess<00:01:52.590> around

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
drum and you don't want to mess around
