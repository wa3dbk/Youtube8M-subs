00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.720 

was<00:05:11.140> an<00:05:11.320> important<00:05:11.770> moment<00:05:11.920> I<00:05:12.250> think<00:05:12.340> we<00:05:12.580> all

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
was an important moment I think we all

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.280 
was an important moment I think we all
knew<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.350> think<00:05:14.350> we<00:05:14.440> all<00:05:14.560> felt<00:05:14.890> it<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:16.480> I

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
knew it I think we all felt it and I

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.310 
knew it I think we all felt it and I
believe<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.890> changed<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:19.810> way<00:05:20.050> the

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
believe that it changed the way the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.050 
believe that it changed the way the
paradigm<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.800> what's<00:05:21.160> possible<00:05:21.220> in<00:05:21.790> Miami

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
paradigm of what's possible in Miami

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.710 
paradigm of what's possible in Miami
they<00:05:22.210> come<00:05:22.480> I<00:05:22.780> think<00:05:23.500> one<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.770> argue<00:05:23.950> that

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
they come I think one can argue that

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.900 
they come I think one can argue that
post<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.260> ordinance<00:05:26.680> Miami<00:05:27.550> became<00:05:27.850> a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
post the ordinance Miami became a

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.660 
post the ordinance Miami became a
