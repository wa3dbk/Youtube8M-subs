update<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.509> Dendrobium<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.500> had<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> few

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
update you on my Dendrobium I had a few

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.610 
update you on my Dendrobium I had a few
questions<00:00:08.580> about<00:00:08.970> spiking<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.960> watering<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
questions about spiking and watering and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.879 
questions about spiking and watering and
so<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.010> but<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.360> wanted<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> share<00:00:13.230> with<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.440> now

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.820 
so on but I wanted to share with you now
this<00:00:14.219> Dendrobium<00:00:14.849> spike<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.360> blooming<00:00:15.929> if<00:00:16.410> you

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this Dendrobium spike is blooming if you

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
this Dendrobium spike is blooming if you
remember<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> repotted<00:00:18.330> Dendrobium

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
remember this is the repotted Dendrobium

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769 
remember this is the repotted Dendrobium
there<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> new<00:00:21.150> chute<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
there and that was the new chute and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.230 
there and that was the new chute and
that<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> flower<00:00:23.070> spike<00:00:23.460> which<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.029> in

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that is the flower spike which is now in

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.890 
that is the flower spike which is now in
bloom<00:00:24.830> beautiful<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.010> also<00:00:26.910> discovered<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
bloom beautiful I also discovered that I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.769 
bloom beautiful I also discovered that I
have<00:00:28.289> new<00:00:28.560> spikes<00:00:29.039> coming<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.510> one

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
have new spikes coming up here is one

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.080 
have new spikes coming up here is one
and<00:00:33.649> here<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.890> another<00:00:36.920> yes<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.700> is

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and here is another yes there it is

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.590 
and here is another yes there it is
you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.010 

yes<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.960> is<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.530> new<00:00:47.800> spike<00:00:48.190> on<00:00:48.489> an<00:00:49.420> old<00:00:49.809> and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
yes so that is a new spike on an old and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.020 
yes so that is a new spike on an old and
Rob<00:00:50.230> young<00:00:50.440> bear<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.829> old<00:00:51.070> spikes<00:00:51.520> have<00:00:51.790> been

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
Rob young bear the old spikes have been

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.900 
Rob young bear the old spikes have been
dead<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.989> gone<00:00:53.200> but<00:00:53.590> even<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> new<00:00:54.550> one<00:00:54.760> is

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
dead and gone but even so a new one is

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.030 
dead and gone but even so a new one is
coming<00:00:55.239> out<00:00:55.329> which<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:55.989> very<00:00:56.140> exciting

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
coming out which is very exciting

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.520 
coming out which is very exciting
so<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:57.940> Dendrobium<00:00:58.540> never<00:00:58.780> lost<00:00:59.050> it<00:00:59.260> leaves

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
so this Dendrobium never lost it leaves

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.460 
so this Dendrobium never lost it leaves
so<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.340> perennial<00:01:00.640> Dendrobium<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:02.080> I'll

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
so it's a perennial Dendrobium and I'll

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.670 
so it's a perennial Dendrobium and I'll
compare<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.309> with<00:01:04.089> this<00:01:04.690> other<00:01:04.989> Dendrobium

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
compare this with this other Dendrobium

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.450 
compare this with this other Dendrobium
my<00:01:05.860> own<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.650> let's<00:01:08.650> bring<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:09.009> here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
my own here it is let's bring it here

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.820 
my own here it is let's bring it here
this<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.390> Dendrobium<00:01:10.720> nest<00:01:11.229> off<00:01:11.500> which

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
this is the Dendrobium nest off which

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.680 
this is the Dendrobium nest off which
had<00:01:12.040> those<00:01:12.220> beautiful<00:01:12.640> fragrant<00:01:13.119> pink<00:01:13.390> blooms

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
had those beautiful fragrant pink blooms

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.499 
had those beautiful fragrant pink blooms
on<00:01:13.990> this<00:01:14.890> dead<00:01:15.220> looking<00:01:15.580> cane<00:01:15.850> which<00:01:16.119> had<00:01:16.330> no

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
on this dead looking cane which had no

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.889 
on this dead looking cane which had no
needs<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.890> flowers<00:01:18.310> are<00:01:18.490> here<00:01:18.660> so<00:01:19.660> now

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
needs and the flowers are here so now

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.779 
needs and the flowers are here so now
apparently<00:01:20.530> this<00:01:20.800> cane<00:01:21.130> will<00:01:21.369> not<00:01:21.550> produce

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
apparently this cane will not produce

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.190 
apparently this cane will not produce
leaves<00:01:22.240> or<00:01:22.539> flowers

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
leaves or flowers

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.889 
leaves or flowers
but<00:01:23.770> what<00:01:23.979> how<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.550> plant<00:01:24.910> survives<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.570> puts

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
but what how the plant survives is puts

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.490 
but what how the plant survives is puts
out<00:01:26.080> new<00:01:26.430> new<00:01:27.430> spikes<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.660> is<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.930> new<00:01:29.080> spike

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
out new new spikes this is the new spike

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.940 
out new new spikes this is the new spike
as<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:30.039> can<00:01:30.220> see<00:01:30.460> small<00:01:31.450> green<00:01:31.899> tender<00:01:32.649> things

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
as you can see small green tender things

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.950 
as you can see small green tender things
and<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.610> has<00:01:33.759> grown<00:01:33.970> quite<00:01:34.270> big<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.750> there's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
and it has grown quite big and there's

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.359 
and it has grown quite big and there's
two<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.410> them<00:01:35.590> like<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.070> one<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.119> two<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
two of them like that one and two you

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.719 
two of them like that one and two you
can<00:01:39.550> see<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:40.050> so<00:01:41.050> these<00:01:41.800> are<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.130> ones<00:01:42.369> that

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
can see that so these are the ones that

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.639 
can see that so these are the ones that
next<00:01:43.390> year<00:01:43.570> will<00:01:43.720> lose<00:01:43.960> its<00:01:44.229> leaves<00:01:44.410> and

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
next year will lose its leaves and

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.210 
next year will lose its leaves and
produce<00:01:45.580> flowers<00:01:46.179> like<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.140> old<00:01:47.320> cane<00:01:47.650> now

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
produce flowers like the old cane now

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.570 
produce flowers like the old cane now
the<00:01:48.280> old<00:01:48.610> cane<00:01:48.909> has<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.900> no<00:01:50.320> good<00:01:50.560> anymore<00:01:50.830> some

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the old cane has is no good anymore some

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.940 
the old cane has is no good anymore some
people<00:01:51.880> even<00:01:52.000> say<00:01:52.150> cut<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.600> off<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.170> put<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.740> in

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
people even say cut it off and put it in

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.740 
people even say cut it off and put it in
a<00:01:54.040> bit<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.310> moss<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.939> promote<00:01:55.299> some<00:01:55.540> new

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
a bit of moss and to promote some new

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.160 
a bit of moss and to promote some new
shoots<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:57.159> I'm<00:01:57.880> happy<00:01:58.330> with<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.600> two<00:01:58.810> shoots

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
shoots but I'm happy with the two shoots

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.429 
shoots but I'm happy with the two shoots
that<00:01:59.470> I've<00:01:59.619> got<00:01:59.829> one<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.759> two<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.420> we'll<00:02:02.290> wait

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
that I've got one and two and we'll wait

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.840 
that I've got one and two and we'll wait
and<00:02:02.619> see<00:02:02.680> what<00:02:02.829> happens<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.490> that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
and see what happens with that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.740 
and see what happens with that
so<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.560> Dendrobium<00:02:06.070> nest<00:02:06.579> or<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
so that is the Dendrobium nest or the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.710 
so that is the Dendrobium nest or the
third<00:02:07.990> one<00:02:08.259> was<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.530> mini<00:02:08.890> Dendrobium<00:02:09.720> which

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
third one was the mini Dendrobium which

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.830 
third one was the mini Dendrobium which
is<00:02:10.869> now<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.560> body<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.950> fully<00:02:12.190> bloomed<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:12.850> I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
is now the body is fully bloomed and I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.380 
is now the body is fully bloomed and I
think<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.440> also<00:02:14.980> losing<00:02:15.310> its<00:02:15.760> leaves<00:02:16.060> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
think it is also losing its leaves on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.740 
think it is also losing its leaves on
the<00:02:16.750> other<00:02:16.930> spikes<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.820> may<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.450> once

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the other spikes so it may be that once

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.479 
the other spikes so it may be that once
all<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.170> leaves<00:02:20.320> are<00:02:20.530> gone<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:21.070> will<00:02:21.100> give<00:02:21.459> a

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
all the leaves are gone it will give a

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.660 
all the leaves are gone it will give a
flower<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.739> leafless<00:02:24.310> spike

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
flower like that so on a leafless spike

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.000 
flower like that so on a leafless spike
so<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.140> Dendrobium<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
so this is one of the Dendrobium that

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.490 
so this is one of the Dendrobium that
loses<00:02:27.489> its<00:02:27.700> leaves<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.209> then<00:02:28.900> produces<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
loses its leaves and then produces a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.800 
loses its leaves and then produces a
flower<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.100> then<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:31.000> compensation

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
flower and then in compensation

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.080 
flower and then in compensation
once<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.410> spike<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:32.920> derided<00:02:33.190> produces<00:02:33.790> more

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
once that spike is derided produces more

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.850 
once that spike is derided produces more
shoots<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.170> there<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:35.530> are

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
shoots so there we are

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.930 
shoots so there we are
this<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.820> actually<00:02:36.970> has<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> cakey<00:02:37.900> growing

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
this one actually has a cakey growing

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.319 
this one actually has a cakey growing
that's<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.299> keiki<00:02:40.720> growing<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:42.329> that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
that's the keiki growing on it that

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.530 
that's the keiki growing on it that
branch<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.380> keiki<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> this

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
branch that is a keiki so this

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.620 
branch that is a keiki so this
Dendrobium<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.350> also<00:02:48.030> behaving<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
Dendrobium is also behaving like a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.650 
Dendrobium is also behaving like a
deciduous<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.920> entropion<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.389> drop

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
deciduous to entropion that is it drop

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.809 
deciduous to entropion that is it drop
its<00:02:52.900> leaves

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
its leaves

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.229 
its leaves
and<00:02:53.909> produce<00:02:54.180> flowers<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.060> update

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and produce flowers so that's the update

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.139 
and produce flowers so that's the update
on<00:02:57.659> my<00:02:58.499> Dendrobium<00:02:59.629> thanks<00:03:00.629> for<00:03:00.780> watching
