00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.540
 hello friends how are you today 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.360
 let's make a new recipe the recipe 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.910
 it's going to be a potato omelette for that 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680
 we are going to specify potatoes in this case 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.960
 we are going to use four large potatoes 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.110
 let's cut the planter style 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.750
 first and then look then that is to say in 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.820
 cubes 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.779
 and so we will be able to work 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.449
 in quantity and place them in oil to 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.300
 Fry the first step is frying potatoes 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.930
 since they take a long time to fry 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.790
 compared to what it will cost us 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.780
 cut the other ingredients that will 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.170
 have the tortilla 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.360
 then we have fried potatoes 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.980
 to proceed to cut the vegetables in 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.440
 this case we're going to use onion parsley and 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.300
 garlic you can put chorizo 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.269
 colorado or any type of chorizo 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.790
 but in this case I only did the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.650
 mix with 4 garlic parsley eggs 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.540
 and onions and has the potatoes 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.940
 they all fell down with the paper but not 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 matter we have to deliver that mixture 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.790
 so that it remains as possible 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.010
 well adhered 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.350
 each other with what one more egg there is that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.280
 seasoning season with salt and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.340
 they can put marinade they can put pepper 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.310
 part oregano in this case that we use 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 everyone 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 and they can put experienced too 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.079
 can put the ingredients that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 you want that is the dressings that 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.100
 you want sometimes I put in sometimes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 to seasoning greens and it's just for me 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 but it's the rest of the people do not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.350
