00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.570
 Today we go back to an animal questions and indeed have me as 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.470
 young people from SÃ¼dstadt asked 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 why there are so beautiful greens in Cologne green areas led our opinion 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.890
 After that are parrots that have been excavated from the zoo or lay in Cologne 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.269
 once in the lungs 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.269
 Let's see if he can find any 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 Apen 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 at the Melatenfriedhof, some of them are said to spend the day 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.550
 but as long as we are looking for it, none of the supposed ones just want to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520
 Show parrots 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.100
 before we look upwards from the constant upward we get dizzy 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.720
 we would like reinforcement 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.350
 but also with Angelika Kral from the ornithological working group 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.330
 Cologne we have no real luck 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.920
 Although some of the birds fly here in the city garden again and again under loud 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.130
 targeted over 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.180
 Yet they are too fast or walk hiding places for consumers 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.000
 the animal filmmaker Helmut Zilk, we still feel a few copies of their list 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.790
 demonstrate 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 while Angelika Kopp enlightens us 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.790
 Mrs. K Lijewski "Green Birds" around which we have today we can now leave 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.600
 and to hear but unfortunately not see 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 and what kind of will it is at all 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.710
 These are collared parrots and they are coming 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.860
 originally 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490
 from sub-Saharan Africa 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 and from drylands the consequences in Yemen and behind India and how is that? 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 so many of them live in Cologne in the wild 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.830
 you are 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.680
 Woerth had been brought here for 48 years 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.560
 and reintroduced voluntarily they did not come 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.020
 and percent they are simply outgrown 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.930
 and at that time there were few birds of prey here 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.920
 and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.730
 a therefore could hold on 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.250
 Whom are the southern outfitter the private keeper came many chances 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.870
 to 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.310
 today nobody wants to have been that they are so she certainly can not 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.259
 and she came from private hands 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:18.109
 we go from the city forest because parents are outgrown with their young 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.739
 and a few years later, percent were said to be so freshly imported 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.119
 Birds at a wholesaler 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.219
 Percent come as a result of a disturbance probably Jere 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.980
 break like many of the southern ones are currently in Cologne 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.189
 They count every year in January and percent can do that pretty well 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.450
 estimate percent 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 there will be about 1000 800 to 2000 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.479
 that's a pretty big number, the samples may have that to other animals 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:52.269
 Food eaten away or called here would be supplanted lectures 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:57.049
 For the first time, everyone comes to sleep from a radius of 30 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.789
 kilometers 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:01.829
 and then that relativizes itself 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.359
 and on the other hand they have not displaced a bird on the contrary they have 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.159
 but one of them has been on the red list until recently 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.239
 Percent even through their caves and paved the way even in the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.499
 To be able to offer city 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:21.619
 Nevertheless, Angelika Kral warns against training exotic animals here 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.619
 it is rarely good and the consequences for the domestic nature is not foreseeable 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.760
 So the beautiful green birds in Cologne are collarbands that are around 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.350
 Escaped private life for 40 years 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.850
 and here have found ideal conditions so that learned something again 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.169
 because they understand a Cologne Red that they can not explain themselves 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.510
 please send your questions to smart at RKC and go and I try the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.510
 Find answer for you until next time 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.519
