00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.630
 percent of its fiscal voting 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.970
 the melody without a single sequence vision 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.590
 we must connect the human being with emotion 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.880
 harmony is a set of pro-Khadafi notes notoriously is that 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.270

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.100
 or let's talk understand a little bit of the declared keyboard nothing more 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 is that a confection of notes data 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.090
 seven brothers 5 black 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.450
 intercalated 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.730
 arm 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 with the difference that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.310
 when it makes the movement caused to my right the sound 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 think that everything else hurt 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.180
 the more they grew 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.100
 you get more serious or more 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.420
 every turn 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.869
 I repeat that it really changes so I only have to heart or if I had to 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.260
 do 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.300
 ah

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.369
 loose 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.019
