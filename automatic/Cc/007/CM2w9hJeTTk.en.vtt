that<00:00:34.950> much<00:00:35.130> clearance<00:00:35.579> back<00:00:35.790> there<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.290> it'll

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that much clearance back there but it'll

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.869 
that much clearance back there but it'll
do<00:00:38.030> these<00:00:39.030> ties<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:40.200> grew<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.410> being

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
do these ties are they grew up being

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.250 
do these ties are they grew up being
that's<00:00:41.879> why<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.149> call<00:00:42.360> traction<00:00:43.170> advantage

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that's why they call traction advantage

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.250 
that's why they call traction advantage
but<00:00:43.940> they<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> wax<00:00:45.329> coating<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.170> when

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.230 
flat in the back of we're down pretty
fast<00:01:46.979> maybe<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.069> few<00:01:48.310> gashes<00:01:48.909> in<00:01:48.939> here

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240
