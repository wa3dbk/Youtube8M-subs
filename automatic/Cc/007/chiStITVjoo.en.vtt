30 millimeter not on this one
and<00:00:19.350> you'll<00:00:20.340> notice<00:00:20.609> before<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.240> take

and you'll notice before you take
actually<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.199> take<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> off<00:00:22.529> count<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
actually if we take it off count the

actually if we take it off count the
number<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> threads<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.060> exposed<00:00:24.359> on

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
number of threads that are exposed on

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.830 
number of threads that are exposed on
the<00:00:24.720> axle<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.090> you<00:00:27.090> can't<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> too

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the axle and you can't really see it too

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
the axle and you can't really see it too
well<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> 12<00:00:29.670> o'clock<00:00:29.970> position

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
well here but in the 12 o'clock position

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.810 
well here but in the 12 o'clock position
I'm<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:31.070> there's<00:00:32.070> an<00:00:32.250> imperfection<00:00:32.610> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
I'm not not there's an imperfection you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.120 
I'm not not there's an imperfection you
probably<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> camera<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
probably can see in the camera that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.510 
probably can see in the camera that
imperfection<00:00:36.140> was<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> dimple<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.190> beat

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
imperfection was a dimple that's beat

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.280 
imperfection was a dimple that's beat
into<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> nut<00:00:39.180> right<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.230> location

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
into the nut right at this location

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.310 
into the nut right at this location
right<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.390> keyway<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> axle<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
right in the keyway of the axle and I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.290 
right in the keyway of the axle and I
sort<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> locked<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.120> what

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
sort of locked that not on there so what

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.209 
sort of locked that not on there so what
came<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> factory<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.100> took

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
came that way from the factory so I took

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.299 
came that way from the factory so I took
a<00:00:47.370> chisel<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.949> put<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a chisel like this and put it in that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.479 
a chisel like this and put it in that
key<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:54.140> like<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.680> drove<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.160> until

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
key way like that and drove it in until

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.630 
key way like that and drove it in until
I<00:00:56.550> made<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> nut<00:00:57.600> round<00:00:57.960> again<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
I made that nut round again and then I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
I made that nut round again and then I
had<00:01:00.090> someone<00:01:00.359> stand<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> brake<00:01:00.989> pedal

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
had someone stand on the brake pedal

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
had someone stand on the brake pedal
actually<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.250> used<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.550> impact<00:01:02.820> gun<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
actually I used an impact gun so you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.340 
actually I used an impact gun so you
don't<00:01:03.359> need<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> worry<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
don't need to worry about if you have a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
don't need to worry about if you have a
big<00:01:04.500> impact<00:01:04.619> gun<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.610> using<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> strong<00:01:06.270> bar

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
big impact gun but if using a strong bar

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760 
big impact gun but if using a strong bar
have<00:01:06.780> somebody<00:01:07.049> stand<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> brake<00:01:07.590> pedal

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
have somebody stand on the brake pedal

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100 
have somebody stand on the brake pedal
and<00:01:08.210> make<00:01:09.210> sure<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.659> pulling<00:01:09.990> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and make sure when you're pulling this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
and make sure when you're pulling this
nut<00:01:10.290> off<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.740> say<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> 2<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.430> 3<00:01:11.640> foot<00:01:11.790> strong

strong bar or or off my spoilers but you
don't<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.320> pushing<00:01:19.909> sort<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> forward

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
or backward in the car because you could

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
or backward in the car because you could
cause<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> credit<00:01:23.159> roll<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:23.520> its<00:01:23.729> jack<00:01:24.000> stand

cause the credit roll off its jack stand

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.530 
cause the credit roll off its jack stand
anyway<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> nut<00:01:25.920> off<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.390> take<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
anyway get that nut off and take it on

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
anyway get that nut off and take it on
off<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> few<00:01:27.960> times<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.439> free<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.009> threads

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
off a few times to free up the threads

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
off a few times to free up the threads
and<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:30.030> turn<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.450> turn<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> backwards

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and then turn it on turn it backwards

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
and then turn it on turn it backwards
and<00:01:31.560> put<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> back<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.340> both<00:01:32.820> 3/4<00:01:33.360> away<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and put it back on both 3/4 away and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.359 
and put it back on both 3/4 away and
then<00:01:34.290> you've<00:01:34.409> got<00:01:34.619> an<00:01:34.710> area<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
then you've got an area that you can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.780 
then you've got an area that you can
pound<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:37.020> beat<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.409> axle<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
pound on to to beat that axle out of the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
pound on to to beat that axle out of the
hub<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> too<00:01:39.960> hard<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
hub you don't want to do it too hard and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
hub you don't want to do it too hard and
you<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.130> want<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> flat<00:01:41.970> piece<00:01:42.240> of

right there's a castle nut suppose the
ball<00:03:27.109> joint<00:03:27.379> on<00:03:27.819> casts<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.180> looks<00:03:29.389> like

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
ball joint on casts and that looks like

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.909 
ball joint on casts and that looks like
that<00:03:29.750> because<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.169> has<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.319> little<00:03:30.470> crown<00:03:30.889> on

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
that because it has a little crown on

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.409 
that because it has a little crown on
the<00:03:31.189> top<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:31.669> round<00:03:32.169> bumps<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:35.060> got<00:03:35.239> one

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
the top of it round bumps it's got one

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.929 
the top of it round bumps it's got one
of<00:03:35.479> these<00:03:36.040> kinds<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.099> car<00:03:37.280> pins<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:37.760> there

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
of these kinds of car pins in there

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.309 
of these kinds of car pins in there
they're<00:03:38.120> reusable<00:03:38.540> if<00:03:38.780> you're<00:03:38.900> careful<00:03:39.109> when

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
they're reusable if you're careful when

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.379 
they're reusable if you're careful when
you<00:03:39.379> take<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.680> out<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:39.949> get<00:03:40.099> that<00:03:40.129> off<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.699> then

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
you take it out so get that off and then

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.550 
you take it out so get that off and then
there's<00:03:41.540> probably<00:03:41.750> tons<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.019> YouTube<00:03:42.169> videos

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
there's probably tons of YouTube videos

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.749 
there's probably tons of YouTube videos
on<00:03:42.680> how<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.799> get<00:03:43.009> a<00:03:43.040> ball<00:03:43.220> joint<00:03:43.370> out<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.699> the

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:43.759 
on how to get a ball joint out of the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.270 
on how to get a ball joint out of the
hub<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:45.290> then<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.620> have<00:03:45.769> your<00:03:45.859> outer<00:03:46.009> tie<00:03:46.250> rod

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
hub and then you have your outer tie rod

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.869 
hub and then you have your outer tie rod
end<00:03:46.669> and<00:03:46.879> this<00:03:46.970> one<00:03:47.150> did<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:47.359> have<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:48.729> pin<00:03:49.729> that

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
end and this one did not have a pin that

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.559 
end and this one did not have a pin that
commuity<00:03:50.150> easily<00:03:50.599> it<00:03:50.840> was<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:52.209> cotter<00:03:53.209> pin<00:03:53.389> like

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
commuity easily it was a cotter pin like

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.939 
commuity easily it was a cotter pin like
this<00:03:54.579> that<00:03:55.579> broke<00:03:55.939> and<00:03:56.209> rusted<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.109> broke<00:03:57.259> so

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
this that broke and rusted and broke so

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.649 
this that broke and rusted and broke so
I<00:03:58.040> drilled<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.459> out<00:03:58.579> with<00:03:58.759> a<00:03:58.790> tiny<00:03:59.060> drill<00:03:59.389> and<00:03:59.629> I

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
I drilled it out with a tiny drill and I

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:00.729 
I drilled it out with a tiny drill and I
didn't<00:03:59.810> actually<00:04:00.049> drill<00:04:00.199> the<00:04:00.290> whole<00:04:00.439> thing

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
didn't actually drill the whole thing

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.469 
didn't actually drill the whole thing
out<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.129> tried<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.609> punch<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.909> up<00:04:01.970> first<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.419> it

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
out I tried to punch it up first and it

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.300 
out I tried to punch it up first and it
wouldn't<00:04:02.659> punch<00:04:02.900> out<00:04:03.079> so<00:04:03.709> then<00:04:03.859> I<00:04:03.979> drilled<00:04:04.250> a

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
wouldn't punch out so then I drilled a

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.069 
wouldn't punch out so then I drilled a
small<00:04:04.340> hole<00:04:04.639> right<00:04:05.120> through<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.599> and<00:04:06.019> that

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
small hole right through it and that

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.390 
small hole right through it and that
took<00:04:06.259> enough<00:04:06.530> strain<00:04:06.799> off<00:04:06.979> it<00:04:07.129> that<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.280> was

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
took enough strain off it that I was

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.520 
took enough strain off it that I was
able<00:04:07.609> to<00:04:07.639> easily<00:04:07.819> punch<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.359> out<00:04:08.449> then<00:04:08.689> then<00:04:09.439> I

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
able to easily punch it out then then I

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.740 
able to easily punch it out then then I
took<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.829> nut<00:04:10.069> off<00:04:10.220> then<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.180> took<00:04:11.239> put<00:04:11.629> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
took this nut off then I took put the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.149 
took this nut off then I took put the
nut<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.819> upside<00:04:13.819> down<00:04:14.319> thread<00:04:15.319> it<00:04:15.409> on<00:04:15.500> almost

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
nut on upside down thread it on almost

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.580 
nut on upside down thread it on almost
all<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.400> way<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:17.139> then<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:18.169> can<00:04:18.409> use<00:04:18.560> it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
all the way and then you can use it

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.620 
all the way and then you can use it
puller<00:04:19.220> or<00:04:19.579> pound<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.000> down<00:04:20.029> but<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.419> have<00:04:20.510> to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
puller or pound it down but you have to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.060 
puller or pound it down but you have to
be<00:04:20.690> careful<00:04:21.049> if<00:04:21.139> you<00:04:21.169> certain<00:04:21.650> types<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.889> pull

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
be careful if you certain types of pull

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.860 
be careful if you certain types of pull
like<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.340> pickle<00:04:22.610> fork<00:04:22.820> fuller<00:04:23.000> because<00:04:23.719> you'll

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
like a pickle fork fuller because you'll

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.720 
like a pickle fork fuller because you'll
damage<00:04:24.050> the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
damage the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.580 
damage the
Tyrod<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.510> grease<00:04:26.050> them<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.440> don't<00:04:26.500> want

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
Tyrod in the grease them you don't want

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.350 
Tyrod in the grease them you don't want
to<00:04:26.740> do<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:27.790> once<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.000> get<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.210> ball

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
to do that so once you get the ball

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.650 
to do that so once you get the ball
joint<00:04:28.690> in<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.350> tie<00:04:29.680> rod<00:04:29.890> end<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:31.240> caliper

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
joint in the tie rod end and the caliper

off and then these shock mounts and this

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.540 
off and then these shock mounts and this
knot<00:04:34.960> right<00:04:35.170> here<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.920> hub<00:04:36.070> will<00:04:36.250> just<00:04:36.400> come

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
knot right here the hub will just come

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.430 
knot right here the hub will just come
off<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:36.880> your<00:04:37.000> hand<00:04:38.430> okay
