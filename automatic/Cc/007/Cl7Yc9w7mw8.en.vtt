ruining the last four rows of the vedala
Blanc<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> first<00:00:48.989> year<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> we're

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
Blanc this is the first year that we're

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.939 
Blanc this is the first year that we're
training<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.160> vedala<00:00:50.460> Blanc<00:00:51.470> so<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.739> see

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
training the vedala Blanc so you can see

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
training the vedala Blanc so you can see
that<00:00:52.980> they're<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.580> just<00:00:54.120> grown<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that they're kind of just grown and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.770 
that they're kind of just grown and
growing<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> control<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.480> training

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
growing out of control so we're training

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
growing out of control so we're training
them<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:58.050> year<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.190> pruning<00:00:59.430> style

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
them this year and the pruning style

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.420 
them this year and the pruning style
that<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.480> chosen<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:01.110> go<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> forearm

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that we have chosen to go is forearm

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.020 
that we have chosen to go is forearm
kniffen<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:04.220> it's<00:01:05.220> hard<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> work<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.820> some

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
kniffen and it's hard to work with some

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.100 
kniffen and it's hard to work with some
of<00:01:06.060> them<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.720> work<00:01:06.930> out

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
of them but some of them work out

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
of them but some of them work out
perfectly<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.460> great<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.300> guess

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
perfectly and they look great so I guess

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
perfectly and they look great so I guess
I'll<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:09.930> started<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.440> prune<00:01:10.619> divine<00:01:10.890> for

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I'll get started and prune divine for

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.570 
I'll get started and prune divine for
you<00:01:11.660> what<00:01:12.660> you're<00:01:12.810> looking<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.399> say

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you what you're looking for when I say

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.040 
you what you're looking for when I say
forearm<00:01:15.060> kniffen<00:01:16.670> I'm<00:01:17.670> talking<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.300> I<00:01:18.690> want

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
forearm kniffen I'm talking that I want

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.260 
forearm kniffen I'm talking that I want
to<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.259> two<00:01:19.619> canes<00:01:20.340> come<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> top

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to have two canes come up to the top

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.180 
to have two canes come up to the top
wire<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.530> spread<00:01:22.860> horizontally<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> also<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
wire and spread horizontally and also to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.090 
wire and spread horizontally and also to
pathway<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> second<00:01:27.420> wire<00:01:27.860> this<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pathway at the second wire this will be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
pathway at the second wire this will be
a<00:01:29.130> fruiting<00:01:29.429> wire<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.940> well<00:01:30.179> you'll<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.929> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a fruiting wire as well you'll have to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.830 
a fruiting wire as well you'll have to
shorter<00:01:31.890> canes<00:01:32.130> come<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> almost

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
shorter canes come out so it almost

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
shorter canes come out so it almost
looks<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.470> F<00:01:34.679> if<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.399> were<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.789> hold<00:01:35.940> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
looks like an F if you were to hold a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.200 
looks like an F if you were to hold a
mirror<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.899> F<00:01:38.539> would<00:01:39.539> have<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.860> hear<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
mirror up to an F would have to hear so

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.640 
mirror up to an F would have to hear so
that's<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> ultimate<00:01:42.780> goal<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.439> however

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
that's what the ultimate goal is however

00:01:43.650 --> 00:02:01.399 
that's what the ultimate goal is however
sometimes<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.369> get

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.230 

how<00:02:02.409> when<00:02:03.310> you're<00:02:03.430> working<00:02:03.580> with<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> vines

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
how when you're working with the vines

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.510 
how when you're working with the vines
you<00:02:05.140> don't<00:02:05.320> always<00:02:05.470> get<00:02:05.740> exactly<00:02:06.159> what<00:02:06.250> you

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
you don't always get exactly what you

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.870 
you don't always get exactly what you
want<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:08.190> obviously<00:02:09.190> only<00:02:09.340> have<00:02:09.610> one

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
want and so obviously only have one

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.010 
want and so obviously only have one
trunk<00:02:10.569> coming<00:02:10.989> up<00:02:11.200> right<00:02:11.470> here<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:13.180> i<00:02:13.540> won't<00:02:13.930> be

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
trunk coming up right here so i won't be

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.350 
trunk coming up right here so i won't be
able<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.519> top<00:02:15.700> wire<00:02:15.940> so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
able to get to to the top wire so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.270 
able to get to to the top wire so
hopefully<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.950> growing<00:02:18.310> season<00:02:19.769> shoot<00:02:20.769> will

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
hopefully this growing season shoot will

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.820 
hopefully this growing season shoot will
push<00:02:21.489> from<00:02:21.700> here<00:02:22.000> or<00:02:22.180> here<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.140> some<00:02:23.620> and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
push from here or here here and some and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.740 
push from here or here here and some and
then<00:02:24.010> next<00:02:24.640> year<00:02:24.910> we'll<00:02:25.120> be<00:02:25.150> able<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> lay<00:02:25.630> it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
then next year we'll be able to lay it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.350 
then next year we'll be able to lay it
down<00:02:25.870> onto<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.260> wire<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.739> make<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:28.090> true

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
down onto the wire and make it the true

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.740 
down onto the wire and make it the true
form

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.650 

cane<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:37.490> be<00:02:37.640> higher<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.150> closer<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
cane to be higher and closer to the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.870 
cane to be higher and closer to the
second<00:02:39.170> wire<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:40.250> since<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.640> don't<00:02:40.670> have

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
second wire but since I don't have

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.660 
second wire but since I don't have
anything<00:02:41.180> there<00:02:41.480> I'll<00:02:41.690> take<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.140> and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
anything there I'll take this one and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.460 
anything there I'll take this one and
just<00:02:43.670> kind<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.940> wrap<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.330> once<00:02:44.540> too<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:44.840> kind<00:02:45.320> of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
just kind of wrap it once too so kind of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.810 
just kind of wrap it once too so kind of
gets<00:02:45.980> used<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.370> being<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.850> position<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
gets used to being in that position and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.330 
gets used to being in that position and
also<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.600> may<00:02:51.200> actually<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.860> able<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.160> bring

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
also I may actually be able to bring

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.770 
also I may actually be able to bring
this<00:02:52.490> one<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.330> top<00:02:53.540> wire

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.490 

you

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.710 

so<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:11.189> doesn't<00:03:11.370> look<00:03:11.549> good<00:03:11.610> right<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.209> but

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so it doesn't look good right now but

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.670 
so it doesn't look good right now but
hopefully<00:03:13.200> that'll<00:03:13.950> be<00:03:15.470> progression<00:03:16.470> for

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
hopefully that'll be progression for

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:26.840 
hopefully that'll be progression for
