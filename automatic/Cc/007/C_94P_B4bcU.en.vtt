tentacles of an octopus the other piece
which<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:30.990> launched<00:01:31.500> earlier<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.159> year

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
which we also launched earlier this year

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.349 
which we also launched earlier this year
is<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> octopus<00:01:34.740> moon<00:01:34.979> phase<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:36.149> we

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
is the the octopus moon phase which we

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.609 
is the the octopus moon phase which we
did<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:37.130> 29<00:01:38.130> pieces<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> reason<00:01:40.109> for<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
did in 29 pieces and the reason for the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
did in 29 pieces and the reason for the
29<00:01:41.009> pieces<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.520> obviously<00:01:41.999> it's<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.719> one

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
29 pieces is obviously it's it's one

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.989 
29 pieces is obviously it's it's one
more<00:01:43.140> face<00:01:43.969> we<00:01:44.969> have<00:01:45.659> done<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> PK<00:01:47.219> 1150

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
more face we have done it with a PK 1150

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.120 
more face we have done it with a PK 1150
movement<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.689> top<00:01:48.929> of<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:50.100> have

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
movement and on top of that we have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.919 
movement and on top of that we have
built<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.609> new<00:01:50.759> face<00:01:50.969> complication<00:01:51.600> together

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
built a new face complication together

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.840 
built a new face complication together
