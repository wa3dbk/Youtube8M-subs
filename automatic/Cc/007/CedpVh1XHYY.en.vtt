00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.920
 how about how welcome are you to your channel 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.560
 of android welcome are all good 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.390
 this time I have a video for 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.940
 show them how to calibrate the battery 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.650
 your cell phone because they are good 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.090
 known the problems that in 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.460
 Sometimes we just bought the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.650
 telephone and aes cases for example some 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.119
 five months six months then we see that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.820
 our battery starts to download 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.680
 very fast or battle to load or 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.989
 different problems sometimes with what 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.660
 is the battery this is not that the battery 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.100
 It does not serve as many times as 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.870
 we just bought a 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.230
 new battery and there is no need for it 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.750
 simply this must be 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.760
 to decompensation problems there but 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.170
 because for that there are applications that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.629
 they help us calibrate the battery and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.940
 they really work, that is, they are not 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.220
 placebo effect does not mean that only 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.860
 they show us here to make us 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.920
 believe that you are really repairing not in 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.199
 truth works clearly in cases that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.910
 that can really be repaired since 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.200
 sometimes if totally 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.090
 battery does not work anymore and then there is no 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.430
 nothing to do but change for a 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.710
 new but if your battery simply 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.800
 battle to load a little or sometimes 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.509
 it downloads very fast but it is has 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.690
 little time good these applications you 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.030
 they will be very useful 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.250
 are two applications which this one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.530
 called battery gauge and the other 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.480
 repair the battery we both found 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 available in the place thor so 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.180
 free we will open first of all 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.560
 the two are used but in this order 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.600
 first what is the calibrator of 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.360
 drums 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 and here he gives us the steps I'm going to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.439
 read so they know for example the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.840
 first tell us to click on the button 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.659
 to start the calibration when 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.940
 finish the process turn off the device 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 charge your battery to 100% light your 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.950
 perfect device your battery is 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.840
 calibrated and then at the end it does not say that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.280
 let's use the following application that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.649
 Now let's show what it is to repair 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.860
 the battery in case there are some sectors 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.810
 out there damaged so you do not put them 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.760
 work good let's give it calibrate 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 here he tells us that he is going to start the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.380
 process and then we must turn it off and 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.200
 load it 100% so it's very 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 important to follow the steps it gives us 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.260
 for this method to work if not then 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 it will not have any effect 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.480
 what the phone tells us 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.480
 identified 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.310
 ok and here we are going to give you permission 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.740
 superuser is mandatory to have 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.340
 surrounded the phone if it's not going to 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.340
 function 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.110
 good is already which is not that this 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.610
 then let's wait for a while 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.510
 that we see the cancel button already 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.189
 that does not appear 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.080
 we give cancel and here already tells us 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.080
 completing the battery calibration 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.660
 and here is your battery has been calibrated 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.460
 We have worked very hard to be able to 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.200
 offer of this software for free 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.790
 we would very much like you to vote for five 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.910
 good stars and we can vote on that 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.970
 how do you like 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.230
 We will cancel and here I place no longer 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.000
 says happiness is the process of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.470
 calibration is over and well here in 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.120
 this point we really have to 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.130
 give him to pay now and put the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.810
 cellular until it is 100% charged 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.400
 after that we can now turn it on 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.470
 well I'm going to leave for 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.090
 continue with the video tutorial then 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.680
 Once you have learned, let's suppose 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.150
 and what we turned off was charged a hundred times 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.650
 hundred and here just turned on once 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.360
 that we have turned on we give in repair 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.400
 Battery the next application 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.290
 this one is obligatorily asking us to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.440
 we are connected to what is a network 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.910
 of data to show us later what 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.459
 is advertising, because it is a requirement of 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.140
 application if you are not going to let us open it 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.430
 and here only what we are going to do 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.430
 what is it to start 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.819
 and here he starts to show us the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.190
 sectors that are correctly 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.630
 working and those who are here 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.080
 tells us that they are low they are 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.340
 inactive or the review process like this 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.750
 is that good because the color 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.910
 you followed and once I finished 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.889
 all that process will try to repair 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.570
 those sectors does not mean that it's going 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.160
 to repair all there are times that you can to 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.680
 Sometimes not, but most of them do 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.070
 is going to repair so that it works better 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.070
 drums 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.100
 and now I'm going to do what I 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.919
 is to pay to undertake what brings a 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.360
 little publicity but then there's no 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.310
 no problem this just becomes a 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.080
 So it is advisable to do it not be 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.700
 once a year once every five months 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.540
 to keep our life from our 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.340
 battery in optimal good condition and if you 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.680
 liked the video do not forget to give 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.210
 like and subscribe help me a lot 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.919

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.870
 help to grow the channel and continue 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.790
