00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
I've been working on my my doll book and
I<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.780> first<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.289> done<00:00:58.530> she

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
I just got my very first one done she

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.080

still<00:00:58.980> doesn't<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> dress<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.910> just

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
still doesn't have a dress but I just

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.250

think<00:01:00.239> she's<00:01:00.829> in<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.160> anyway<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:03.989> why

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
think she's in it so anyway this is why

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.250 
think she's in it so anyway this is why
you<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> new<00:01:05.369> projects<00:01:06.110> for<00:01:07.110> my

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the fattest part on the bird and so that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.760 
the fattest part on the bird and so that
was<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> area<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> started<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.150> first

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
was the area that I started with first

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
was the area that I started with first
and<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.950> keep<00:01:35.250> filling<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:37.140> doing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and I just keep filling it up I'm doing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
and I just keep filling it up I'm doing
just<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.950> side<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.460> time<00:01:38.490> adding<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.540> much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
just one side at a time adding as much

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.140 
just one side at a time adding as much
tape<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.409> need<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.170 

I<00:01:45.290> did<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> camera<00:01:47.460> turned<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.880> when

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I did not have the camera turned on when

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
I did not have the camera turned on when
I<00:01:48.210> did<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.660> head<00:01:48.900> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> neck<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I did the head in the neck but as you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.900 
I did the head in the neck but as you
can<00:01:50.400> see<00:01:50.570> it's<00:01:51.570> simply<00:01:52.350> done<00:01:53.190> with<00:01:53.430> smaller

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
can see it's simply done with smaller

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.790 
can see it's simply done with smaller
amounts<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:55.200> paper

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
amounts of paper

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.570 
amounts of paper
lots<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.700> masking<00:01:57.240> tape<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:58.680> tapered<00:01:59.370> that

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
lots of masking tape and I tapered that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.240 
lots of masking tape and I tapered that
body<00:01:59.850> into<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> neck<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.260> made<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> much

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
body into the neck and then made a much

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.720 
body into the neck and then made a much
smaller<00:02:02.930> head<00:02:03.950> hopefully<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.220> see<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
smaller head hopefully you can see that

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.050 
smaller head hopefully you can see that
for<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.510> neck<00:02:06.930> itself<00:02:07.650> I<00:02:07.950> bent<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.550> cardboard

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
for the neck itself I bent the cardboard

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.360 
for the neck itself I bent the cardboard
so<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.990> so<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.710> head<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.130> looking

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so that the so the head would be looking

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.780 
so that the so the head would be looking
slightly<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.090> side<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:14.430> you're

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
slightly to this side and then as you're

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.730 
slightly to this side and then as you're
going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.150> seeing<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.260> moment<00:02:16.620> I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
going to be seeing in just a moment I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.240 
going to be seeing in just a moment I
use<00:02:16.980> super<00:02:17.459> sculpey<00:02:18.080> without<00:02:19.080> baking<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.950> for

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
use super sculpey without baking it for

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.949 
use super sculpey without baking it for
the<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> beak<00:02:21.750> rather<00:02:22.560> than<00:02:22.830> paper<00:02:23.959> then

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
the for the beak rather than paper then

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.620 
the for the beak rather than paper then
I<00:02:25.110> cut<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.350> cardboard<00:02:25.709> tail

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
I cut a cardboard tail

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.500 
I cut a cardboard tail
I<00:02:27.860> found<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> shape<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> tail<00:02:29.880> online

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
I found the shape of the tail online

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.320 
I found the shape of the tail online

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
case you missed it before I thought

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.540 
case you missed it before I thought
about<00:02:44.940> using<00:02:45.390> just<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.750> cardboard<00:02:46.110> piece<00:02:46.550> for

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
about using just a cardboard piece for

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.449 
about using just a cardboard piece for
the<00:02:47.640> wings<00:02:47.910> but<00:02:48.300> because<00:02:48.690> they<00:02:48.930> have<00:02:49.310> kind<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the wings but because they have kind of

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.940 
the wings but because they have kind of
quite<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> bit<00:02:51.540> more<00:02:51.690> shape<00:02:52.080> than<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> would

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
quite a bit more shape than that I would

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.560 
quite a bit more shape than that I would
have<00:02:53.070> bended<00:02:53.370> up<00:02:53.519> having<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> add<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> lot<00:02:54.540> more

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
have bended up having to add a lot more

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.690 
have bended up having to add a lot more
crumpled<00:02:55.290> paper<00:02:55.470> anyway<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.310> went<00:02:56.610> ahead

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
crumpled paper anyway so I went ahead

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.259 
crumpled paper anyway so I went ahead
and<00:02:56.989> patted<00:02:57.989> out<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.500> wings<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.150> can

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
and patted out the wings and as you can

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.020 
and patted out the wings and as you can
see<00:03:00.330> there<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.140> beak<00:03:01.800> itself<00:03:02.220> has<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.640> super

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
see there the beak itself has the super

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.600 
see there the beak itself has the super
sculpey<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:04.769> I'm<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.130> adding<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
sculpey and here I'm just adding a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.610 
sculpey and here I'm just adding a
little<00:03:05.640> bit<00:03:05.910> more<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> top<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.380> wing

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
little bit more to the top of that wing

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.580 
little bit more to the top of that wing
so<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.190> has<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.660> natural<00:03:09.660> shape<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.350> so

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
so that it has the natural shape and so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.290 
so that it has the natural shape and so
that<00:03:10.709> there<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.190> dividing<00:03:12.090> line

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
that there can be a dividing line

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.880 
that there can be a dividing line
between<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.750> two<00:03:12.870> wings<00:03:13.350> when<00:03:13.590> they<00:03:13.680> come

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
between the two wings when they come

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.430 
between the two wings when they come
together<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.580> did<00:03:15.239> not<00:03:15.510> have<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> camera<00:03:16.380> on

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
together I did not have the camera on

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.060 
together I did not have the camera on
when<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.040> added<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.050> legs<00:03:19.070> unfortunately

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
when I added the legs unfortunately

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.210 
when I added the legs unfortunately
those<00:03:20.340> were<00:03:20.550> done<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.970> wire<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:22.440> paper

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
those were done with wire with paper

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.050 
those were done with wire with paper
over<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.820> them<00:03:24.000> now<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.690> know<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.080> wasn't

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
over of them now I know that wasn't

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.490 
over of them now I know that wasn't
complete<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.450> didn't<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.049> didn't<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
complete I didn't I didn't have the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920 
complete I didn't I didn't have the
camera<00:03:28.860> turned<00:03:28.890> on<00:03:29.250> all<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.030> time<00:03:30.239> for

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
camera turned on all of the time for

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.380 
camera turned on all of the time for
that<00:03:31.049> particular<00:03:31.500> part<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.700> process<00:03:33.180> but

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
that particular part of the process but

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.970 
that particular part of the process but
hopefully<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:33.900> get<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.260> idea<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.830> how

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
hopefully you can get the idea of how

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.850 
hopefully you can get the idea of how
that<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.820> actual<00:03:36.390> shapes<00:03:36.720> were<00:03:36.989> put<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.380> if

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
that the actual shapes were put on if

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.220 
that the actual shapes were put on if
you<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.820> wonder<00:03:39.120> why<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.420> put<00:03:39.840> super

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
you if you wonder why I put super

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.430 
you if you wonder why I put super
sculpey<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.459> beak<00:03:41.959> when<00:03:42.959> everything

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
sculpey here on the beak when everything

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.170 
sculpey here on the beak when everything
else<00:03:43.650> was<00:03:43.860> made<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.190> paper<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.940> why<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
else was made of paper this is why I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.270 
else was made of paper this is why I
wanted<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.810> be<00:03:45.989> able<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.440> open<00:03:46.769> up<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.070> beak

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
wanted to be able to open up the beak

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.259 
wanted to be able to open up the beak
after<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.019> shell<00:03:49.019> had<00:03:49.320> dried<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:51.120> was

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
after the shell had dried and that was

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.420 
after the shell had dried and that was
really<00:03:51.480> easy<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:52.290> because<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
really easy to do because the the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.009 
really easy to do because the the
sculpey<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.910> course<00:03:54.120> wasn't<00:03:54.329> attached<00:03:54.780> to

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
sculpey of course wasn't attached to

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.170 
sculpey of course wasn't attached to
anything<00:03:55.350> else<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.889> he<00:03:56.010> used<00:03:56.280> paper<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:57.030> would

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
anything else if he used paper you would

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.730 
anything else if he used paper you would
have<00:03:57.359> teh

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
have teh

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.890 
have teh
and<00:03:57.890> everything<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.390> would<00:03:59.540> end
