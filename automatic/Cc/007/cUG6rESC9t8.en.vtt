 we work in the wood oven but 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.260
 previously as here you put a meat that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.170
 It is reputed to be a little dry though 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.550
 the kitchen is many hours with the kitchen 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 Traditional is always a bit dry 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.310
 then we make a technical kitchen 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.500
 first in low vacuum atmosphere 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.540
 at a very low temperature in the oven 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 professional and then yes here comes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.310
 in the wood oven about 20-25 minutes a 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.729
 200 250 degrees until it's already toasted 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.920
 and also receives the aroma of wood from 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.310
 oak no 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.740
 and good here we get porco suckling pig 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.500
 Celtic as the suckling pig of Castile 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.619
 but Galician pork porc 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.490
 ecological native Galician also in 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.259
 this case I have fed naturally 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.539
 of dark skin and who is recovering 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.530
 by enough breeders in Galicia 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.970
 I was practically also 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.490
 disappeared is not about recovering 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.210
 everything of high quality that was 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.460
 disappearing good the here the same thing is 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.020
 a kitchen in low temperature many 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.320
 hours and then enters the furnace 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.910
 firewood 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.330
 in the wood oven, well, you have to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.640
 arrive 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.490
 to toast the skin is the important thing 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.400
 the skin only varnished a little bit with 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.300
 your own juice and it has to be be 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.840
 the skin 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.330
 I'm not going to, I'm not going to play with him 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.920
 knuckle but you would have to touch with like 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.750
 if it was a drum it has to sound like 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.680
 a drum when it is crispy that is 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.680
 can eat is that it is at its point 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.920
 the traditional galician kitchen mixes 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 with creativity in dishes like 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.010
 scallops au gratin with hazelnuts or the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.660
 empanada now that we have a plate of 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.940
 empanada arrives 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.280
 yellow in this case but the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.950
 peculiarity stamping nothing is that is 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.420
 made with wheat flour from the country of 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.390
 Galician wheat is a lot of flour 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.890
 quality that was lost 30 30 years ago and 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.650
 who is now recovering and also 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.050
 It is ground with traditional grinding in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.920
 zamburiÃ±as of a traditional mill 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.810
 Arosa au gratin in the oven with 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 hazelnuts we try to incorporate the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.440
 fruits of the forest surrounding the house as 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.560
 they were the centenarians that 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.000
 they surround the house so much the crumb what is 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.680
 pastry as to the main dishes 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.090
 the hazelnut is a fruit a little 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.460
 forgotten in Galician cuisine and we are 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.580
 trying to buy it and here we have 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.580
 a few bags of tickets in euros 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.300
 the homemade desserts and the wine list 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.460
 Galician authors are the complement 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.170
 perfect for our palate to 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.780
 delight as much as it is now going to do 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.820
 our sight after a delicious meal 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.620
 nothing better than walking through an environment 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.010
 unique the flood forest of a 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.010
