00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.199
 analyze icons on the desktop 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.050
 1 navigation 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.050

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:15.120
 regular place that is maintain 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.579
 something like this 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.569

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.860
 everything is working 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.790
 close 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.470
