00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.320
 the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.099
 the federation had expected this 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.320
 that is why it used to be called to shorten the age 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 because of the little owl this is known as a group of farmers and often not 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.349
 simply does not get home on time 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.190
 but i did sweeper to see an unexpected computer game both churches 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 the church did know that the striker finished the last chance to win the tour 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 first and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.589

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.499
 he did not sit on himself and lays down to be ajax a day later 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.090
 also thanks to the kestrel of peregrine falcons that said in February already 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 plenty to experience 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.060
 oh well 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.930
 later perhaps that the stones and frequent image that creates the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.100
 expectations 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.320
 after a year of absence, they would give the act the presence 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.140
 great expectations at our expectations 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.730
 in turn, the lts regularly received unexpected visitors 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.240
 they want to be brave 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 that is perhaps too restless 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.410
 the little owls disappeared completely unexpectedly 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.570
 fortunately because we switch garage in winterswijk 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.930
 Another decor councilors April 15, arie rise 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.750
 in the meantime, two old acquaintances of experience too came into the picture 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.010
 Alkmaar for the oil price with a proposal 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.519
 further what set our sights on the comments 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.119
 the robin and the house sparrow 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.019
 wait and see 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.870
 8 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.879
 the interest was only a week away 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.449
 one could already have ten companies 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.329
 that has to do with it 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.280
 approve this 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 regularly 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.229
 that's another 4 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.579
 and with female wood owl 2 bullet round and gentlemen 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.949
 mid April comes to fully enjoy the little pretty successful 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.519
 but the buyer gets it spoken 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.499
 what about the great tit with the robin and house sparrow 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.459
 we occasionally saw them for the webcams 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.919
 and especially the house sparrow acted expectantly 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:58.889
 but apparently 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.889
 they will nevertheless fall in another Member State 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.599
 we look who have there 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.949
 it won't be true this one 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:13.229
 yes experience spring 2015 received unexpected visitors from the center 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.229
 where he was absent last year 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.599
 and so during this season tricks first became starling forest 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.609
 to admire 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 completely unexpected 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.799
 in the peregrine falcons and plastic chaos 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.459
 the regular chat with a 13 year old male constantly dealing with 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.859
 attackers 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.859
 after weeks of trammelant 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:45.589
 his role was taken over by one of the burglars who hopes that after waiting 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:52.489
 in May against the storks, the player is good as full 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.099
 and the little owls dragged with me got s 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 a strike 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.979
 the young peregrine falcons were served time 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.819
 our plan late and therefore unexpected 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.769
 the kestrels appeared again 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.769
 they would still 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.479
 and yes, on the last day of May the female lays her first egg 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.539
 care depreciation 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.710
 meanwhile this first stone and the young the cupboard well for a moment then and that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.999
 boys frank says how translate what are premature the wrist 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.370
 then there was the category of unexpected visitors 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.180
 this one suggested the works 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.379
 that was no surprise 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.680
 for us 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.559
 but for Peter R and not 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.919
 they had in a special for experience the spring and ijssel exhibition garden 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.729
 laid out 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.949
 8 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.370
 the storks also received unexpected visits and then a visit 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.539
 After the winners had done their work, the peace quickly returned to who 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:08.359
 the the 9 I am surprised with dangerous night squatters 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.069
 not happy with a hisser off 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.680
 thanks to let come experience the spring a month longer than usual 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.650
 after the first egg from spain on 27 June a crisis 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.650
 it falls to the family union 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.569
 that's how polite twente 2015 was 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.259
 expect one of the expected 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.699
 and then expect 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.110
 what is spring experience without surprises 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.690
