this<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> amp<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:23.790> using<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> crunch

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
this the amp I'm using the crunch

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
this the amp I'm using the crunch
channel<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> big<00:01:26.490> era<00:01:26.700> 3<00:01:27.030> 3<00:01:27.299> 3<00:01:27.509> XL<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
channel on the big era 3 3 3 XL so I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
channel on the big era 3 3 3 XL so I
think<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> soon<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.490> gives<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> little

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
think it soon actually gives a little

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
think it soon actually gives a little
bit<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:30.329> light<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.840> everybody<00:01:31.259> knows<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
bit more light to everybody knows that I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140 
bit more light to everybody knows that I
like<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> crunch<00:01:32.759> tunnel<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
like kind of like the crunch tunnel the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.440 
like kind of like the crunch tunnel the
best<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.659> abut<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.619> amp<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
best on is abut on this amp but here we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.220 
best on is abut on this amp but here we
go<00:01:36.600> so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.330
