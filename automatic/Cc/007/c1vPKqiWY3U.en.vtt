practice you know it to help make your

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.390 
practice you know it to help make your
finger<00:01:57.170> stronger<00:01:57.680> because<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.010> action<00:01:58.370> is

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
finger stronger because the action is

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.790 
finger stronger because the action is
ridiculously<00:01:59.060> high<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.540> guess<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.650> get

some<00:02:00.979> of<00:02:01.070> them<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.310> are<00:02:01.400> older<00:02:01.790> they're

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
some of them that are older they're

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.170 
some of them that are older they're
they're<00:02:03.380> nicer<00:02:04.100> guitars<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.670> woods<00:02:04.880> better

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
and the story just does it probably

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.130 
and the story just does it probably
doesn't<00:02:49.580> make<00:02:49.760> sense<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.239> them<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> lot
