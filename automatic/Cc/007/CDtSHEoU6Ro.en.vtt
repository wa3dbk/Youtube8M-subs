00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.210
 ono is Paul 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:11.140
 Today 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:15.570
 A little Oh it in the middle but I'm towards the little one location in Kreca 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.570
 Because there is a time from the video overwork tv 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.289
 I wondered what to talk about 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:29.270
 Yes I'm thinking of doing this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:32.189
 When I said something, I realized that it was so important to throw away this 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.660
 And say something to Tteyuu are killing me 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.560
 When you start something new 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.820
 Environment, people, things, etc. 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.530
 Such things 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.530
 I think it is very important to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.070
 And say if this does it mean 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.100
 There I humans 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.100
 When starting something new Nikon start something new 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.620
 Hey he says he has courage 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.710
 More than anything 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:10.170
 Or say can not be why new 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.520
 It is scary that there is no environment, something or something like this. 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.800
 No doubt you're noticed it by I know this 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:23.990
 For example, I want to start a business, but I'm working now. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.520
 Environment that there is to throw away 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.750
 I can not do it because I'm scared to lose 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.080
 Maybe that way 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.030
 I think that maybe I feel 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.909
 Even if you say you want to start a business 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.710
 There is work to do 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.150
 I think that I feel troubled with 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.180
 It is better to clearly say discarded 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.760
 Sprouting is a good was discarded 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 It's a bit like this 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.570
 Well then 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.300
 Nothing s you though char with water containing in that cup which I my anxiety facebook 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.490
 But I write 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:05.210
 Referred to as the was the water that has entered into a cup 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.150
 For example, the water of your cup is now full sail 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.569
 You are still full now 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.719
 I already have a full sail 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.990
 In is a So now in this volume of water when you start something you So new there, for example, 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:22.130
 I will fill in the water of the Mano 's water brother Brother water 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.030
 You can see what happens 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.540
 It's overflowing 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.340
 Why 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.329
 It's overflowing therefore I will flow to the water there because there is what is now 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.210
 So after all you can not do something 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.450
 To shoot fan 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.970
 Become 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.640
 Right 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.920
 But there is a simple solution this time 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.720
 Of the national flag 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.620
 It's water, but I'm taking something out of the glass now 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.540
 The do's by water issues 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:01.660
 Then I think I understand this, but new things are new things 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.319
 It's new water does not enter and put the water, but easily 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.610
 It's easy to get in 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.610
 In the air 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.660
 I did not draw by myself, but 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.170
 The water has been buzzy, so I had to overwhelm myself 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 You 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.400
 so 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.450
 When I got out the Wow 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.010
 It became like that, but when I actually put out the sound 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.090
 Water enters from there 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.590
 I get in 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:40.040
 So I noticed that after all I thought water was so important to pull out cats 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:45.319
 Well I like that also is all likely that environment people who are now 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.410
 It's so important to pull out, and if you do that, I'll try something like this from now on 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.620
 It was easy to enter 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.560
 Get into easy 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.960
 Useless for You're because put to be entering the simple Curran 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.910
 I get into 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.240
 Interestingly 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.710
 What 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.030
 Whether this is merely its there now environment or human Toka thing as 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.510
 me 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.510
 I'm not saying I'm going to throw away the water in the drainage ditch 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.989
 It's good if transferred to other pop to the tongue when removing the water 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.620
 You should transfer to other cups and put in the refrigerator 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.800
 Hey 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.790
 It's good if you put a later time or keep in the refrigerator it 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.360
 Because 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.270
 I do not need to shine once 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:40.570
 Think of that whether it is to think in my this is required now not a need now 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.540
 It is very important to eliminate it 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.020
 If you do it, it's totally different 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.889
 What is it 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.889
 I guess 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.440
 I had put Chiba 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.889
 That's what it feels like 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.030
 1 I'm really going to come in 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:04.380
 Up to now environment, people and things 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.580
 To get a different place hit only city once sleep that kind of 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:12.800
 Keep in refrigerator of water 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.330
 And if I put in new water and put it in again later, I'll come back later 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.249
 It's ok 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.179
 Because 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:22.719
 For example, when playing, so are places 

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:23.370
 Just like an environmental company It 's good to dance once with water dance 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:27.110
 2 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.110
 If you really want to start something new 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.639
 I'm scared like such a great thing, but in the case of me, I 'll be selfish 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.390
 Ne 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.840
 I say that the lamp has fallen to home 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:45.760
 Though in I do not even so back to no longer back so 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:50.610
 The main thing that you are looking at now is that you're really happy just because you are in an environment where you can return 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.610
 Why don't you think and pull it out once 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:58.310
 Though I talk Tteyuu what you had to say forest while driving 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.310
 Regards ridge yl see you par a like this
