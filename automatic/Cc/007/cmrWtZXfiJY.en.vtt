am<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.359> only<00:03:24.540> one<00:03:24.780> who's<00:03:25.200> thinking<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
am I the only one who's thinking that

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.550 
am I the only one who's thinking that
maybe<00:03:26.130> just<00:03:26.700> maybe<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.660> would<00:03:27.870> have<00:03:27.989> been<00:03:28.139> okay

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
maybe just maybe it would have been okay

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.409 
maybe just maybe it would have been okay
to<00:03:28.620> make<00:03:28.829> hoosier<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.310> last<00:03:29.489> boss<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.090> that

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
to make hoosier the last boss and that

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.479 
to make hoosier the last boss and that
them<00:03:30.660> changing<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.380> from<00:03:31.500> Hades<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.099> nekron

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
them changing it from Hades to nekron

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.940 
them changing it from Hades to nekron
didn't<00:03:33.329> make<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.599> whole<00:03:33.840> lot<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.079> sense<00:03:34.319> just<00:03:34.829> as

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
didn't make a whole lot of sense just as

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.620 
didn't make a whole lot of sense just as
about<00:03:35.280> as<00:03:35.489> much<00:03:35.609> sense<00:03:35.849> as<00:03:35.970> Hades<00:03:36.299> being<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
about as much sense as Hades being the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.120 
about as much sense as Hades being the

I've<00:03:39.419> always<00:03:39.660> wondered<00:03:39.959> why<00:03:40.260> Square<00:03:40.590> Enix

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
I've always wondered why Square Enix

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.979 
I've always wondered why Square Enix
used<00:03:41.130> Hades<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.700> sparingly<00:03:42.269> when<00:03:42.540> they<00:03:42.630> loved

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
used Hades so sparingly when they loved

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.780 
used Hades so sparingly when they loved
using<00:03:43.380> Greek<00:03:43.560> mythology<00:03:44.099> so<00:03:44.280> often<00:03:44.549> in<00:03:44.669> their

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
using Greek mythology so often in their

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.610 
using Greek mythology so often in their
work<00:03:45.030> I'm<00:03:45.599> sure<00:03:45.660> there<00:03:45.989> could<00:03:46.169> be<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.319> number<00:03:46.500> of

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
work I'm sure there could be a number of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.349 
work I'm sure there could be a number of
reasons<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.280> but<00:03:47.340> oddly<00:03:48.030> enough<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
reasons for this but oddly enough I

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.150 
reasons for this but oddly enough I
noticed<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.720> pattern<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.079> Hades<00:03:49.859> has<00:03:50.010> only

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
noticed a pattern that Hades has only
