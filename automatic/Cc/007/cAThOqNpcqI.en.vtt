00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
both nodes I have no 1 no 2 no one is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
both nodes I have no 1 no 2 no one is
going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.099> my<00:00:32.250> primary<00:00:32.519> no<00:00:33.360> 2<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.870> to

your manager so let's go back into node

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.080 
your manager so let's go back into node
1<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.469> see<00:01:55.859> what's<00:01:56.069> happening<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.700> going

and let's go back to note 1 and yes
installation<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.340> -<00:02:11.490> seated<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.060> node<00:02:12.360> 1

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
installation is - seated on node 1

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.610 
installation is - seated on node 1
awesome<00:02:13.410> let's<00:02:13.590> check<00:02:13.800> node<00:02:14.069> 2<00:02:15.620> installations

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
awesome let's check node 2 installations

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.400 
awesome let's check node 2 installations
to<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.890> -<00:02:16.950> lets<00:02:17.250> close<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
to see - lets close on this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.440 
to see - lets close on this
and<00:02:18.500> let's<00:02:19.220> go<00:02:19.310> back<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.610> know<00:02:19.760> one<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.270> close

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
and let's go back to know one and close

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.200 
and let's go back to know one and close
that<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.200> I'm<00:02:21.560> going<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.710> minimize<00:02:22.130> my<00:02:22.490> server

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
that and I'm going to minimize my server

that and I'm going to minimize my server
manager<00:02:23.840> dashboard<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.790> let's<00:02:25.790> open<00:02:26.600> up<00:02:26.870> our

next you guys want to do a file server
for<00:03:01.910> general<00:03:02.240> uses<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.890> think<00:03:03.890> later<00:03:04.100> on<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.520> you

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
for general uses I think later on if you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.900 
for general uses I think later on if you
guys<00:03:04.820> interested<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:06.020> will<00:03:06.400> go<00:03:07.400> over<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
guys interested I will go over the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.790 
guys interested I will go over the
scale-out<00:03:08.300> file<00:03:08.720> server<00:03:09.020> for<00:03:09.290> application

scale-out file server for application

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.080 
scale-out file server for application
data<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.310> pretty<00:03:10.490> interesting<00:03:10.760> if

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
data this is pretty interesting if

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.720 
data this is pretty interesting if
you're<00:03:11.530> doing<00:03:12.530> server<00:03:12.860> applications<00:03:13.550> or

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
you're doing server applications or

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.700 
you're doing server applications or
virtual<00:03:14.090> machines<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.720> leave<00:03:14.960> file<00:03:15.260> open

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
virtual machines that leave file open

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.250 
virtual machines that leave file open
this<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.120> way<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.300> go<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:17.810> for<00:03:17.960> now<00:03:18.080> we're

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
this is the way to go but for now we're

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.899 
applications
I<00:05:03.169> think<00:05:03.620> applications<00:05:04.159> would<00:05:04.340> be<00:05:04.370> best<00:05:04.699> if

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
I think applications would be best if

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.279 
I think applications would be best if
you're<00:05:05.060> doing<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.360> scale<00:05:05.659> out<00:05:05.810> but<00:05:06.020> we're<00:05:06.139> not

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 
and we're gonna test our cluster we're

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.700 
and we're gonna test our cluster we're
gonna<00:07:57.800> like<00:07:58.330> kill<00:07:59.330> node<00:07:59.720> one<00:08:00.050> and<00:08:00.260> see<00:08:00.380> if<00:08:00.530> no

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:06.830 
latency between the failover works I'm

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.680 
latency between the failover works I'm
