 Introducing dsc rx 100 m 4 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 dac rx 100 m 4 will be a better eye for the series

 It is a popular model equipped with the auger and the sensor of c that changes one way 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.810
 The 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.110
 bac rx 100 produce 4 maximum of evolution point 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:38.230
 Mori one-on-one tensor layered type 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:43.030
 x- is better to conventional one point that equipped with rs cmos sensor 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 Data readout speed compared to back-illuminated cmos sensor 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 It is faster than your child 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.410
 Enables video expression that was not possible with conventional digital camera video cameras 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.350
 became 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.880
 Above all, it's fun to have a subject up to 90060 fps 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.720
 Slow motion 10 days 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.720

 Swimming goldfish 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:27.460
 t 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:29.170
 We capture super slow motion video such as rippling 20 red with this product of pocket size 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:36.400
 I can do it 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:41.180
 Moreover, it is a surprise to be able to get in full hd although the sense of resolution is lost a little 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:45.750
 dsc rx 100 m 4 is the first in cyber shot 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:52.950

 randjnet 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.800
 In addition , speeding up of data reading speed reduces moving body distortion. 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.470
 Memorable distortion shutter 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:09.250
 High-speed shutter of up to 1/32000 sec

 High-speed continuous shooting of the middle and the top 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.500
 Still image shooting has greatly contributed to the hearth 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 Hmm 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.760

 There is almost no dissatisfaction with the operation system that has matured through the series 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:55.030
 However, when shooting focusing on videos, the battery will decrease. 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:01.659
 I like better to power in each time on whether mobile battery to carry a spare battery 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.440
 Either way, you can only shoot high-resolution, high-quality still images with the image sensor. 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.620
 Not 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.830
