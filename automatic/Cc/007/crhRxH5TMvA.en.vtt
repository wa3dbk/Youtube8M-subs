00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:23.800
 we all always liked photos or 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.190
 if we come somewhere lavender fields 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.490

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.730
 I want to grow it at home or on 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.940
 his plot to grow 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.749
 lavender no big deal 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.499
 exists 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:45.620
 just you take the seeds if you have it 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:50.030

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.809

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.890

 if you want to leave her in the house 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.660
