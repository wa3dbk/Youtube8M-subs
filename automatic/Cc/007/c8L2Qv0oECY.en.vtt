 purpose of developing produce 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.990
 high-tech equipment and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.970
 thus outperforming the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.690
 expectations and needs of our 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.789
 customers 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 the content proposed to give an overview 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.080
 reality of everything that may involve the

 write we always wish you a good 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.380
 training to start the assembly is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 important that you have at hand the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.899
 needed tools k key bring 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.800
 1516 keyhole 42 key cannon key 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.190
 combined 7 16 two keys of 6 two 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.110
 9 16 screwdriver and wrench keys 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 philips for the electrical part and a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.730
 rubber hammer to differentiate the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.489
 identify which one has xavi 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.440
 this key is the mechanism that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.600
 turn on the equipment to move it 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.479
 time up ora down 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.850
 this column is called trigger and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 in it are important parts such as the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 Shutdown bar and the looks 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.560
 furniture located at the ends of the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.259
 bar 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.509
 the other column called triggered is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.259
 characterized by not finding the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.020
 Senator 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.939
 besides the differences that we have already highlighted 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.619
 columns are composed of a 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.380
 Spindle protection zone cart Bushing 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.390
 work that seeks safety 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 The screw cap 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.829
 protect the inside of the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.650
 column against crashes and accidents 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.990
 the cart is the moving part of the elevator is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.860
 where they are eternally in search of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 job 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.810
 the pursuit of safety and where they are set 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.180
 the arms inside the box you 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.990
 find the rubber shoes 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.090
 the nuts and bolts the arm brake 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.920
 and the current 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 finally separates the two pairs of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.590
 each arm consists of three 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.140
 parts the arm that the crushed part 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.209
 fore the page is organized and the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.170
 threaded support for shoes 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.630
 eraser 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.340
 before starting the assembly of the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 automotive credit lift 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.020
 check the height of the strollers they 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.080
 should be exactly the same in both 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.239
 position columns in the column 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:32.360
 h based on the side without the stretcher places 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.360
 five screws with them but do not tighten 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.730
 with the company's current includes 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.610
 column in the outer direction of the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.040
 base, leaving the screws at the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.489
 further away from the screens at the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 column now to firmly pet these 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.180
 screws 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.010
 Now we're running the chain with the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.200
 help of the instigators of the column to 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.019
 Senator puts the screws on the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.330
 indicator on the base and fasten on the nuts 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.510
 welded to the base of the column 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.209
 tighten the indicator screws until the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.000
 that the chain is stretched there are 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.180
 some standards that must be respected 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.640
 first distance bolts must 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.640
 be one of the two indicators and 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.720
 according to the current must be stretched without 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.390
 exaggerations 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.239
 the ideal this point point to achieve 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.870
 easily swing the chain with the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.230
 hands 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.690
 after that, use the screws 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.440
 always look out for the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.630
 columns 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.190
 they must be positioned 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.950
 frontally one to the other 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.750
 if this does not happen, the screws and 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.750
 correct positioning 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.840
 complete with chain oil 90 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.040
 halfway and close the lid if you prefer. 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.519
 use grease 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.530
 now we'll put our arms in the carts 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.560
 separate a park and place next to each 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.220
 column in front of the column calls for a 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.799
 arm between a thousand passing through the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.049
 here then the arm brake with the base 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.950
 Turned down with gift 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.780
 screws tightening without exaggeration and 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.780
 this operation with the other data
