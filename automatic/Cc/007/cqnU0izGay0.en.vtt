00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 now I was on the computer and I here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
 an issue if this same one that wanted 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.740
 buy a single chip 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.790
 he's two options for me were obvious 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 uai fans or galaxy which of the two is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.920
 I was buying this question that in this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.500
 Libyan and will help people and peres 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 in this iphone 6 different comparison 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.550
 galaxy in this case the elite version and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 is the only one to do with history 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 probably in which the hands and the two 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 feet were in various categories and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.059
 first of these is the design I think 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.430
 what a god advantage because they are year of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.100
 pretty pretty then both pretty well 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.340
 built and schwenck but say that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.890
 there was perhaps that s6 is a danger admits 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 that the iphone 6 but that the iphone site 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 seems one that comes over the treasure by 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.730
 example to go to the floor than s6 is 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 because it is not all made of glass like 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 these however are the two most 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 in my opinion it has two 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.820
 top teamships completely flagships 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 has not here one is pointing the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.379
 Anybody, God , of course. 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.570
 that it will always depend on you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.369
 God, they think the second one is pretty. 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 thing for me is very important in 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.930
 smartphone then had to be a 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 category is equipment battery and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.210
 here I have to say that no god 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.320
 is properly a book on the market by 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.680
 so to say 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 hence to be honest the batteries of a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 on the other they are nothing special either 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.520
 both will last a day a digital on oc1 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.619
 common day so moderate but between the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
 two diseases has been endangered 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.570
 slightly higher however I like 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.390
 is slightly higher is a margin 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.880
 very small for example is father would say 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.850
 staying up differences aside 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 one hour between using the two batteries 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 The third thing you want to talk about is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 country is very important and is breaking 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.219
 usually begins to be here one 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.259
 standard are both very good 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.360
 I'm probably both yesterday. 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.969
 ensure the best cameras in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.610
 any smartphone windows phone 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.910
 and the market at this time both the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.899
 iphone leave like these are cameras 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.120
 absolutely fantastic that not even 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.690
 it 's worth it to say which one to 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 smash 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.360
 in one of the situations website does better 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.190
 in the snippet is the galaxy those with the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.620
 advantage but not worth being here 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.300
 how is to compare because in both and not 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.520
 it's worth you too compare 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.470
 You were not even going to discuss more 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.960
 strong is best not to play on day 6 is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.340
 who better because they are with and compete in 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.950
 every verse of eny cony 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.470
 not worth it is a style photographs 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.960
 absolutely fantastic for a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.460
 smartphone with the sensor of this size 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.530
 when things already start those 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.470
 books of a hood are the last three 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.390
 points five is a software is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.600
 That's a father, I do not think I'll be able to. 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.480
 help a lot because by how you were 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 in this cup is soito while this 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.330
 android cup wally pop and here is a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.220
 completely personal reference 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.350
 You like the android then 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.840
 probably this is probably the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.540
 major decisive factor in 3d equipment and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.090
 this I am very balanced Czech 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.310
 in this is the 1 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.250
 You'll see, let's go to one side or 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.440
 the other that taste the more android like 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.230
 more sweat but how you came here is 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.800
 also perceive my personal opinion 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.730
 to me I like more because iof by 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.590
 two things 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.140
 the simplicity of the operating system is 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.260
 much simpler, not having as many 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.430
 customization options contains the android but 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.530
 Our country also 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.720
 besides being a new craft is also a 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.060
 benefit ratio makes the production system 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.250
 rather simpler and second thing 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.170
 which is probably the deciding factor is 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.600
 quality of applications 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.150
 she already has a story to catch and has already 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.030
 many things caps do not have but it is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.130
 guest not the quantity and quality 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.590
 of iPhone apps and I do not know 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.510
 why but often developments 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.640
 much more forces for iphone 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.920
 for android is something that I 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.950
 I do not understand but in some cases it is 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.590
 for example we have the application of the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.390
 periscope is a twitter application 15 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.459
 Spanish West but does not yet exist 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.870
 android are these little things that 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.359
 make us choose the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 instead of android to give you driver on 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.049
 But I always like to use both 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.560
 creative themes were really 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.130
 choose only one stay kalentieva and not 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.170
 with 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.150
 the service is certainly what it is 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.650
 creates only could for example use a 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.600
 during the next year 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.750
 the second thing a god influencing 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.300
 a screen and this is where a discussion is 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.880
 clear advantage for those children 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.950
 the screen is fantastic is one of the best 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.760
 but the best and crepe I've ever seen one 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.580
 smartphone is not so and acrid on iphone 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.860
 It is not bad despite not no lady 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.990
 have so many pixels good mattress the screen 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.420
 to be here at the fingertips of the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.450
 fan is not bad but the mechanical and 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.200
 site is look at is another galaxy for so 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.480
 tell 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.210
 It is very good and here any day 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.810
 I chose the time on the screen of the 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.570
 iphone 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.370
 the last category that is missing is a 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.750
 of tapes that people like the most 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.820
 because it's not worth the other smartphones 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.040
 it is not in large part of the other sea 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.710
 strong and is the impression sensor 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.900
 and here it is clear that the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.120
 magician as it was not believed that the victory 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.160
 goes in this case for the iphone site 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.040
 the options sensor on the iphone site is 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.510
 very good the galaxy these is not bad but 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.090
 if I had to say 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.860
 I would say the sensor disease of the iphone site 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:43.290
 It's for sure I'm going there 19 on 21 29 30 while 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.270
 that's the right kind of shit and 12 in 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.390
 for something like that 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.680
 important is a difference is still 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.260
 considerable but will do this 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.000
 choose it will always depend on you 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.550
 they're there to see why you know 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.530
 give themselves much importance and grow 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.980
 Olympic or 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.260
 digital and more if you like more 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.600
 go android I stress this again because 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.770
 something that ours and decides to 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.280
 They want my advice. 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.560
 so I do this west android 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.100
 Olympian see which god they like 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.750
 more 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.090
 see the 0 and won more than 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.740
 I just bought this sea phone I 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.720
 I was able to further deepen the detection of 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.920
 software a new feather for example can 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.310
 tell which is 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.650
 You'll have a new one while you're at it. 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.080
 samsung will last for some time i could 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.480
 to say that twitter is a Swedish channel 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.130
 It's better but it's still not as good as 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.290
 I wish it was but this is in my 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.750
 opinion you can forget to interest 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.130
 updates you can handle 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.900
 however this as I know enough 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.550
 people that I like a lot 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.010
 You do not like I do not want to go too far. 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.320
 politically because always an opinion 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.060
 and personal and back may be different 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.930
 Now one thing I want it to be clear. 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.180
 what is 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.180
 I bought you a smartphone or I bought 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.250
 Other you guys are going to get kicked by Martin 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.220
 moniz are going to stay with everybody, we win 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.010
 Let's be completely happy, always. 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.440
 m1 without any kind of doubts tnf 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.830
 are between one and another but I do not think 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.090
 buy it are going to be very much going to be 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.160
 well serve 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.380
 but ready project says that with lyon 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.400
 arrived here in the video what deus ex 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.200
 pinecones the e6 or is 67 or iphone 6 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.480

 so a boy she would say only also 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.640
 want to buy what these do in our 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.650
 global date partner or global tap 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.660
 en a link to buy will be in 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.790
 description also as a way of 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.610
 thanks for an interest of sp
