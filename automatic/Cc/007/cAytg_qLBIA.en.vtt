00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
you could pick up hang up you have your
volume<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> volume<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
volume up and volume down you have a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.510 
volume up and volume down you have a
three-and-a-half<00:01:40.500> millimeter<00:01:41.070> auxiliary

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
three-and-a-half millimeter auxiliary

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030 
three-and-a-half millimeter auxiliary
port<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.720> could<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:43.079> connect<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
port so you could actually connect that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
port so you could actually connect that
wire<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.700> another<00:01:45.000> device<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.229> could

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
wire to another device or you could

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
wire to another device or you could
actually<00:01:46.530> daisy<00:01:46.979> chain<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.579> brave<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
actually daisy chain these brave and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually daisy chain these brave and
speakers<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:48.960> another<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> get

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
speakers to one another so you get

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.980 
speakers to one another so you get
really<00:01:50.100> strong<00:01:50.579> volume<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> stronger<00:01:51.659> output

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
really strong volume and stronger output

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.120 
really strong volume and stronger output
in<00:01:52.079> general

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
in general

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
in general
yeah<00:01:53.369> ball<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.149> microUSB<00:01:55.049> port<00:01:55.320> right

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
there to charge its internal battery now
the<00:01:58.320> cool<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:58.710> about<00:01:58.799> brave<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> speakers

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the cool thing about brave and speakers

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
the cool thing about brave and speakers
that<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.540> also<00:02:00.719> pack<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.979> specific<00:02:02.430> one

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that they also pack a this specific one

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.920 
that they also pack a this specific one
it<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.659> features<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> 1400<00:02:05.130> milliamp<00:02:05.610> at

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
it actually features a 1400 milliamp at

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.389 
it actually features a 1400 milliamp at
1400<00:02:06.930> milliamp<00:02:07.320> hour<00:02:07.469> battery<00:02:07.560> inside<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
1400 milliamp hour battery inside of it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.949 
1400 milliamp hour battery inside of it
so<00:02:08.550> while<00:02:09.030> you're<00:02:09.179> playing<00:02:09.330> your<00:02:09.509> music<00:02:09.569> you

charge it simultaneously so if you ever
need<00:02:15.599> backup<00:02:16.140> juice<00:02:16.379> this<00:02:16.830> also<00:02:17.040> works<00:02:17.400> just

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
need backup juice this also works just

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.130 
need backup juice this also works just
like<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.180> also<00:02:18.299> backup<00:02:18.780> battery<00:02:19.110> for

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
like that it's also backup battery for

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.330 
like that it's also backup battery for
you<00:02:19.349> guys

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you guys

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.039 
you guys
I<00:02:20.370> believe<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.090> button<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.959> to

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
I believe this button here is just to

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.589 
I believe this button here is just to
indicate<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.920> battery<00:02:23.220> level<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.909> you<00:02:24.480> have

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
indicate the battery level and you have

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.729 
indicate the battery level and you have
also<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.959> out<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.680> course

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
also the out so you could of course

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.270 
also the out so you could of course
daisy<00:02:26.220> chain<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.849> know<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.129> speakers<00:02:29.129> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
daisy chain you know the the speakers to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.589 
daisy chain you know the the speakers to
one<00:02:29.459> another<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.299> gonna<00:02:30.450> play<00:02:30.569> some

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
one another so just gonna play some

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.569 
one another so just gonna play some
music<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:31.860> hear<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.159> audio<00:02:32.430> quality

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
music so you can hear the audio quality

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.119 
music so you can hear the audio quality
from<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> brave<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.629> 600<00:02:34.140> will<00:02:34.560> first<00:02:34.860> play

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
from the brave and 600 will first play

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.449 
from the brave and 600 will first play
on<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.549> iPhone<00:02:35.879> 4s<00:02:36.180> at<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.440> lowest<00:02:37.829> volume<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
on the iPhone 4s at the lowest volume I

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.399 
on the iPhone 4s at the lowest volume I
had<00:02:38.849> actually<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.209> highest<00:02:39.690> volume<00:02:39.870> setting

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
had actually the highest volume setting

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.920 
had actually the highest volume setting
so<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:40.980> could<00:02:41.159> gauge<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.909> actual<00:02:42.540> audio

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
so you could gauge the actual audio

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.069 
so you could gauge the actual audio
quality<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.519> two<00:02:45.090> two<00:02:45.329> devices<00:02:45.629> here

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
quality of the the two two devices here

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.110 
quality of the the two two devices here
so<00:02:46.260> let's<00:02:46.440> get<00:02:46.590> started<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.220> let's<00:02:47.280> play<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
so let's get started and let's play a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:03:02.510 
so let's get started and let's play a
song<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:48.629> put<00:02:48.930> two<00:02:49.170> maximum<00:02:49.650> volume

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.700 

so<00:03:03.030> that's<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.420> audio<00:03:03.750> quality<00:03:03.900> from<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
so that's the audio quality from the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.830 
so that's the audio quality from the
action<00:03:04.980> force<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.490> now<00:03:05.850> gonna<00:03:06.120> switch<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
action force of the now gonna switch it

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:30.869 
action force of the now gonna switch it
over<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> brave<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.710> steeper

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.039 

so<00:03:31.879> it's<00:03:32.060> not<00:03:32.150> bad<00:03:32.390> at<00:03:32.569> all

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
so it's not bad at all

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.509 
so it's not bad at all
a<00:03:33.079> little<00:03:33.470> bit<00:03:33.590> distortion<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.220> loudest

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
a little bit distortion the loudest

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.039 
a little bit distortion the loudest
volume<00:03:34.819> setting<00:03:35.299> bring<00:03:35.689> it<00:03:35.780> down<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.959> couple

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
volume setting bring it down a couple

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.800 
volume setting bring it down a couple
notches<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.129> seems<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.640> lot<00:03:37.970> better<00:03:38.030> you

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
notches and it seems a lot better you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.330 
notches and it seems a lot better you
definitely<00:03:39.200> feel<00:03:39.349> the<00:03:39.590> bass<00:03:39.769> coming<00:03:40.099> out<00:03:40.280> of

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
definitely feel the bass coming out of

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.270 
definitely feel the bass coming out of
this<00:03:40.459> guy<00:03:40.640> even<00:03:41.150> from<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.420> good<00:03:41.720> distance<00:03:42.049> away

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
this guy even from a good distance away

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.649 
this guy even from a good distance away
and<00:03:43.280> has<00:03:43.549> some<00:03:43.760> really<00:03:43.790> nice<00:03:44.150> audio<00:03:44.480> quality

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
and has some really nice audio quality

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.649 
and has some really nice audio quality
very<00:03:45.409> natural<00:03:45.950> again<00:03:46.489> just<00:03:46.730> gotta<00:03:47.060> put<00:03:47.510> down<00:03:47.629> a

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
very natural again just gotta put down a

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.599 
very natural again just gotta put down a
couple<00:03:47.900> notches<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:48.500> you<00:03:48.620> get<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.950> better

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
couple notches so you get a better

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.759 
couple notches so you get a better
fidelity<00:03:49.879> with<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.480> output<00:03:50.930> but<00:03:51.200> Robair

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
fidelity with the output but Robair

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.860 
fidelity with the output but Robair
content<00:03:52.129> with<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.579> seems<00:03:53.030> like<00:03:53.180> pretty
