seeming<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.079> he<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.829> lazing<00:00:47.399> around

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
seeming like he was just lazing around

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
seeming like he was just lazing around
he<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:48.270> trying<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.020> learn<00:00:49.200> things

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
about the world there in and like I like

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 
about the world there in and like I like
the<00:00:52.590> whole<00:00:52.739> series<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> challenges<00:00:53.340> because

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the whole series of challenges because

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
the whole series of challenges because
Steph<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.840> trying<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> challenge<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
Steph was trying to challenge them to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310 
Steph was trying to challenge them to
games<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> seemed<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.660> luck<00:00:58.079> was

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
games in which it seemed like luck was

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
games in which it seemed like luck was
the<00:00:58.469> only<00:00:58.680> determining<00:00:59.460> factor<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> Sora

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the only determining factor and Sora

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
the only determining factor and Sora
kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.199> counters<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> idea<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
kind of counters with this idea that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
kind of counters with this idea that
there<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> no<00:01:03.120> such<00:01:03.149> thing<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.660> luck<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
there is no such thing as luck and that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.700 
there is no such thing as luck and that
games<00:01:05.309> every<00:01:05.970> game<00:01:06.210> has<00:01:06.510> factors<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
games every game has factors that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
games every game has factors that
contribute<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> who<00:01:08.400> wins<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> who<00:01:09.150> ever

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
contribute to who wins and who ever

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.870 
contribute to who wins and who ever
knows<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.170> most<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:10.740> factors<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.520> going

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
knows the most of these factors is going

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
knows the most of these factors is going
to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> winner<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:13.619> always

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to be the winner and like there's always

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
to be the winner and like there's always
something<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.549> deduce<00:01:15.000> about<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.479> game

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
something you can deduce about a game

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
something you can deduce about a game
that<00:01:16.110> will<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.560> easier<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.490> if

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you're intelligent enough to get that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
you're intelligent enough to get that
and<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.250> he's<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.790> he's<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
know getting that light yagami kind of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.480 
know getting that light yagami kind of
ghoulish<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.479> stuff<00:01:24.840> um<00:01:25.189> which<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.340> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
but but the way they were doing it is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.170 
but but the way they were doing it is
