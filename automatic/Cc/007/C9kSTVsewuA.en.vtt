 Well, today I'm going to answer the 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.799
 question should they also be 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.779
 quite interesting and how can you read 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.549
 he says hello I have some questions that 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.670
 make yourself look I have an aquarium of 45 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.560
 liters with 73 red eyes two females 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.720
 guti and I would like to put four females 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.919
 and two more males of good is also 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.439
 I have an ancestor of about four 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.269
 centimeters I would like to know if with that 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.609
 size you could know the sex of this 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.769
 the zetas are hiding all day 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.439
 they only go out at night when the 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.030
 light off why does that happen apart 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.250
 I would like to know how much care the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.900
 fish that I have also delivered that 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.640
 they need the water with a gh 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.920
 high and that's why he decided to put rock 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.650
 calcareous I also have the fact of java 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.960
 and many leaves are supposedly ugly 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.500
 for lack of potassium as it could be 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.640
 give thanks in advance and greetings 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.220
 Well, now I'm going to answer you 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 all your questions that really are 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.610
 very interesting 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.290
 to be normal because today I'm going to 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.120
 answer adriÃ¡n that has started me 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.200
 a few things to have read 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.619
 before the mail 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.149
 and he says that I tend to 445 liters already 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.159
 you know what I think of the aquariums 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.159
 45 liters of is the limit of for 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.590
 put fish but as your fish are 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.159
 small as well 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.920
 neither would anything happen if you do not put 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.240
 many good should be answering the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.189
 bukis 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.340
 it's very good as you have all the 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.110
 they have to be in a ph of seven 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.880
 and a half with the calcareous rocks that you have 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.340
 you're going to get stuck reach seven 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.130
 half eight since for the blows is 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.520
 ideal and the phd then those seven and a half 8 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.710
 and then the gh because it's going to stay 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.840
 in 10 15 than for the bubis 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.010
 incredible are going to be very very very 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.290
 well there 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.990
 as for the back 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.730
 all three need a basic ph or 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 slightly acidic that is 76 knows a 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.410
 thing like that but good if you are going to have them 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 seven and a half nothing would happen and what 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.380
 I tell you to see me very results 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.840
 interesting that you told me that your 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.970
 behind red eyes both the day 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.460
 hidden by the day and only when 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.080
 they turn off the light is when they come out they do not 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.480
 you find if they have red eyes is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 because they have an albino gene gene 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
 albino if it manifests before in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.110
 animals that are in caves that are 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.360
 hidden that do not need the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 Sunlight protection is to say that 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 you just bought the nightclubs 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.570
 As I'm telling you, it's the turn of 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.000
 those you back so you're never going to 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.560
 know in full light because it bothers them go 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360
 to always be hidden and they're just going to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.480
 be active at night 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.120
 so look and then as for the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.790
 java milk has the leaves are little 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.310
 withered but it's a bit of the subject of something 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.500
 well because probably still which 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.810
 is new and is not very paid with the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.630
 waste of the fish when they carry 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.890
 more time and the aquarium has a bit 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.990
 more than fertilizer 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.330
 Well, you 'll see it a little stronger and 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.970
 then apart from the light so intense light to 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.140
 the best you do not have adequate light in 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.330
 your aquarium 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.310
 so nothing has been easy the 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.190
 answers you know because they hide 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.020
 the back because they generally have 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.670
 and they do not have red eyes then they do not 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.250
 they will leave you in the light of the good day 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.990
 I forgot francis trucks with 4 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.300
 centimeters you can not know if it 's male 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.180
 or female this is known from more or 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.790
 less than the sixth or seventh month in which 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.860
 the adults start them out mustaches 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.580
 in what would be in the mouth and in the area 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.440
 central 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.080
 with four centimeters you still have left 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.540
 much that is at least 23 months 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.980
 until you know if it's male or female and 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.470
 at the moment you can not know 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.000
 and nothing because I already tell you state is the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.530
 doubts that I had but that you liked 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.569
 the video and nothing then a greeting and I and 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 nothing 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.530
 see you guys later
