00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:04.464
 (music) 

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:06.730
 Auguste Born is likely 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.196
 the first person who deliberately distorts destroys the human body, 

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:15.231
 which has been for thousands of years 

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:19.159
 presented with reverence whole and completed; 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.062
 But to do this in the form of a sculpture, he had to turn around 

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:24.433
 to the sculptures of Ancient Greece and their fragments. 

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.898
 In 1910 Egon Schiele did the same in paint. 

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:31.083
 This is an extremely radical image. 

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:34.834
 We observe "Seated naked man", self - portrait of 

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.357
 Egon Schiele from 1910, in the Leopold Museum. 

00:00:38.357 --> 00:00:41.146
 Shile was only 20 years old when he painted this painting. 

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:44.286
 It represents a really large square sail, 

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.515
 as he portrays himself, his own body 

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:52.152
 with cut feet and heavily curved hands, 

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.871
 as the body is diagonally stretched on this blank white background. 

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.241
 The arms are so curved that, as you said, 

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.774
 we can not see them, 

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:05.700
 so he is just a head, torso, limbs, 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.481
 without the parts of the body with which we capture the world. 

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.992
 He is literally worn as loose. 

00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:14.741
 The expressiveness of the body 

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.468
 reminds me of Michelangelo about the way Michelangelo 

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:20.468
 has used the body to express emotion. 

00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:22.547
 But instead of musculature, 

00:01:22.547 --> 00:01:25.320
 heroism and the way Michelangelo inspires the body 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.145
 divinity through his power, 

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:29.604
 here we have a body that has practically exhausted, 

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:33.749
 which is so weak that it will almost break. 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.447
 Here is delicacy and sensuality. 

00:01:36.447 --> 00:01:39.622
 Take a look at, for example, the hairs on the legs, 

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:43.825
 how they almost like the mustaches of an underwater creature 

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:47.387
 can feel even the lightest wind, the lightest push. 

00:01:47.387 --> 00:01:51.009
 There is a strong perception here. 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.153
 To some extent, it's because the eyes are red. 

00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:56.532
 The grains are red, the genitals are red, and the navel. 

00:01:56.532 --> 00:02:00.160
 All this speaks of inner intensity, 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.707
 so here is sexuality, there is violence, 

00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:07.100
 it looks like he's just a physical wrapper, 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.577
 which seems to be contrary to the intensity 

00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:12.862
 and the power of the emotional creature inside. 

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:14.986
 It's a funny way for me 

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:19.763
 Shile has taken on himself as such a serious object of art. 

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:22.297
 If we think about the history of art, its objects 

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:26.524
 are religion, aristocracy, princes, kings, 

00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:29.510
 and here, at this point in the late 19th and early 19th century 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.025
 early 20th century, 

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.703
 this depiction of subjectivity, focusing on oneself, 

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:39.922
 of self-expression and the use of radical methods. 

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:41.444
 The question that Shile 

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:43.118
 he seems to have set himself up 

00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:47.406
 "How can I give the body visually as a way 

00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:49.068
 to understand the inner being? " 

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:57.313
