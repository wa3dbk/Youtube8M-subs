one of the ends and it really doesn't
matter<00:02:12.750> which<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.560> because<00:02:14.280> they're<00:02:14.700> both

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
matter which one because they're both

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the same size and then we're going to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.199 
the same size and then we're going to
fold<00:02:18.810> our<00:02:19.080> little<00:02:19.349> pocket<00:02:19.859> in<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.969> fold

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
that in instead of just cutting it off

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.300 
that in instead of just cutting it off
if<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.850> want<00:02:25.090> less<00:02:25.330> bulk<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:26.080> your<00:02:26.320> card<00:02:26.620> you

if you want less bulk in your card you

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.430 
if you want less bulk in your card you
might<00:02:27.460> just<00:02:27.730> want<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> cut<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.330> off<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:29.110> for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440

if you prefer not to have a pocket on

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.160 
if you prefer not to have a pocket on
this<00:03:14.410> particular<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:16.240> just<00:03:16.270> adhere

this particular one you can just adhere
that<00:03:17.200> down<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:18.430> we're<00:03:18.700> going<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.090> make<00:03:19.240> one

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
that down but we're going to make one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.460 
that down but we're going to make one
more<00:03:20.020> pocket<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.540> time<00:03:22.930> I'm<00:03:23.230> going

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
more pocket and so this time I'm going

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.240 
more pocket and so this time I'm going
to<00:03:23.560> open<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.070> up<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.380> did<00:03:26.560> before

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
to open it up and like we did before

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.330 
to open it up and like we did before
I'm<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.239> fold<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:28.900> down<00:03:29.050> almost<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
I'm going to fold this down almost to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.150 
I'm going to fold this down almost to
that<00:03:30.519> score<00:03:31.090> line<00:03:31.120> if<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:32.110> fold<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.680> right<00:03:32.920> on

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
that score line if you fold it right on

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.020 
that score line if you fold it right on
the<00:03:33.730> score<00:03:34.150> line<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:35.260> causes<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> little<00:03:36.190> more

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
the score line it causes a little more

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.340 
the score line it causes a little more
difficulty<00:03:37.660> with<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:39.510> lying<00:03:40.510> flat<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:41.140> that's

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
difficulty with it lying flat so that's

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.910 
difficulty with it lying flat so that's
why<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.620> don't<00:03:42.239> fold<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.420> directly<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.230> so

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
why I don't fold it directly on and so

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.449 
why I don't fold it directly on and so
there<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.370> our<00:03:45.550> second<00:03:46.030> pocket<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.690> again<00:03:47.459> I'm

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
there is our second pocket and again I'm

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.160 
there is our second pocket and again I'm
just<00:03:48.670> going<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.940> use<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> little<00:03:49.750> bit<00:03:49.989> of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
just going to use a little bit of

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.810 
just going to use a little bit of
adhesive<00:03:50.489> for<00:03:51.489> my<00:03:51.640> big<00:03:51.850> adhesive<00:03:52.330> gun<00:03:52.570> or
