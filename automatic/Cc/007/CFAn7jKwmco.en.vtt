00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.689
 started the mx cup at the stadium 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.059
 hot for the club team tijuana 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.889
 Hot fitness who managed to get her 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.230
 first victory within the panorama of 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.539
 the 2014 opening on the branch of the cup 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.519
 of mx with goals of darío benedetto and 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.320
 Benny Corona and Henry Martin on the team 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.689
 Tijuana could get his first three 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.939
 points and being in the leadership of the sector 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.650
 three inside the cup of mx with the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.269
 team of chivas these were the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.189
 words from both technicians 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.289
 Cesar Farias and Mr. Ignacio 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.449
 Rodriguez already after the game in 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.449
 press conference our team 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.490
 well 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.310
 maybe have the same specific weight 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.440
 that has tijuana we are not a team 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.969
 what we have 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.530
 Forty-odd days of work 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.420
 together 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.969
 and at least five of the players 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.070
 who participated today two years ago 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.469
 months were playing in second 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.890
 division so our specific weight 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.890
 do not 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.160
 not equal to the entire campus of tijuana 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.500
 however our proposal of benítez 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.970
 can come to make a match 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.310
 compete to compete and see 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.920
 what for which it reached us because 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.810
 when we were practical knowing the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.430
 potential of the rival and how difficult the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.790
 court because a difficult court 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.050
 anyone 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.460
 and they did interesting things and understand 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.580
 beyond the result that always 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.260
 uncomfortable a defeat always leaves you 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.890
 quiet because I see that the boys 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.290
 they did what I asked them to do and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.850
 what they are learning to do are two 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.430
 different tournaments 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.620
 what yes 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.620
 leave us conscious and calm 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.420
 beyond not having achieved the 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.049
 results of the first two days 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.630
 tells us what we have played for 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:00.030
 win we have played to have 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.030
 had together today in our saddlebags 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.720
 we do not have them from circumstances that 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.120
 happen like this but we're not near a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.280
 result when you do things right 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.080
 you note game sequence and then 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 I was worried if we did not have 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.020
 sequence of the game during the three 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.760
 matches we have shown 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.410
 that we can attack from the left 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.960
 right by the means we can 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.580
 surprise that we have the ball that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.060
 will promote in three quarters that we can 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.060
 wait well 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.330
 stopped 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.340
 this sequence has been the product of 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.250
 work and product of caigua works that 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.650
 they are releasing all that preseason 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.020
 sometimes no leagues and another next exit 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.080
 what we can never enter into 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.150
 a despair now without being conscious 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.500
 that there is a job and that that gives 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.709
 results and we continue 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.430
 insisting 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.420
 i 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 pellerano dairon 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.060
 among others that is that good mobile and 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.890
 we play with a squad or the most serious 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.840
 we had for today and yet 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.940
 We could also dose some 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.840
 they have had more minutes for the game 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.510
 Friday 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.540
 and to that you add a bad incentive 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.870
 international, it's nice to play this 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.549
 weather 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.190
 I'm one of the coaches that I think if 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.230
 you can play twice a week that 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.970
 there is no better training than playing 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.280
 we also this cup we want 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.530
 play with the greatest seriousness to 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.349
 try to get as far as possible and 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.470
 I hope we can be in a final because 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.000
 do not pay them 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.580
 we are not going to be distracted he showed 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.890
 winter is another great different story 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.500
 rival a team very well a great technician 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.670
 they touch but that we have 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.670
 need and have 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.340
 and in what was a mixed zone they talked 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.650
 dario benedetto alfredo the brown chango 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.110
 and joe benny crown about the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.390
 working of tijuana and as they expect 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.489
 the match against the tigers they know 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.470
 that will be a complicated opponent and that 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.780
 they will have to beat it to get the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.740
 first three points within the tournament 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.720
 opening- 2014 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.670
 in a case of feeling the locality 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.990
 to try to do the same party 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.699
 what we did today that I think we did very 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.199
 well how not to fall into despair 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.680
 in case you can not get all three 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.079
 points of your next 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.750
 and really, how good we come from two 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.360
 defeats and that 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.820
 takes down on this bit but I think that 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.030
 today in the mood does not serve to lift 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.550
 and hopefully next Friday we can to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.470
 the three points 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.680
 physically find 100% run the 90 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.190
 curved minutes yes the truth that I 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.530
 I feel good already last semester 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.660
 I put 100 and well I made a good 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.340
 preseason and goes up when the 100 and 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.150
 now the goal as well as came to 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.770
 despair you touched her if one entered a 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.970
 little bit in that despair but it has 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.610
 to be calm and not to 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.520
 reeducate them and good and could I give no 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.900
 you can 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.900
 to the rival we know what 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.210
 tigers but win always gives confidence 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.639
 of what we seek the distributed beyond 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.289
 to get the win I think it's kind 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.790
 everything in the moments play in the 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.360
 ball 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.970
 that we could do all that the most 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.710
 salvage of everything and good with this 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.010
 confidence and expectation of the party's 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.010
 Friday 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.730
 I then after two years got 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.970
 three goals with what you felt quite 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.970
 all right 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.840
 personally well with a lot of confidence 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.929
 how to beat tigers this next 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.320
 Friday 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:53.470
 we know what 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.250
 does not do anything easy comes from a victory 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.250
 pretty good psychically 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.470
 a lot of confidence you want to keep the 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.900
 ownership and not be more hollow 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.660
 with images of carmen quirós I have for 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.660
