00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello guys we're talking about is the fire are 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.010
 welcome to another minecraft video and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 In this video I'll show you 5 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.870
 very funny bugs in minecraft then 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.789
 go to the first bug to be shown 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.050
 bulgaria the first book will be running 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.090
 faster not 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 just that you have something on top 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.599
 of your head between two blocks so that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 You can run and jump and you will. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.540
 much faster but much faster 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.540
 even then this is the first bug 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.079
 I second the bug is to be shown is that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.250
 Can you climb high walls? 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.520
 only with the interim and without bug ness in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.620
 I mean with a buggy without it we are 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.469
 can you stay these walls is only you 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.050
 get very close here playing at erbil 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.920
 and you're going up then let me 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.010
 put sec oops i my god the fall 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 It will be ugly now when you fall there. 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.780
 Can you stay there, just follow? 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 this trajectory here but she has to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 hit something you can not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 err ready climbed right and another bug 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.439
 also that can be used with the inter- 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.900
 Piu is you going through any block 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.890
 any kind of wall that is only reached 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.799
 close here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.490
 the father is only you come near cable in 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.820
 erbil 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.280
 the father not to let there getting ready 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.659
 I did not play here well in the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.579
 corner and you can cross 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.860
 any wall block 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.360
 Let's try here in this block of iron 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 Let's see if I can do it. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 O people go through anything. 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.159
 Anything we can do 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 to cross soon we got another one. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.079
 very interesting bug in minecraft is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.270
 you can make invisible doors 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.369
 this is very useful here because you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.070
 can do the door hid the button 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.689
 get into the lever and it's really cool and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.540
 person is going to keep killing himself from trying 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.160
 go so it's pretty cool even then to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.410
 You do the invisible part , it's just you. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.200
 break a blog down and break the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.800
 aside also here was a rule stone 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 in that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 in that block beyond the side and you put 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.070
 here that door of the fences nec 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 generally everyone uses a door 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.140
 normal you put in the door and now 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.630
 puts a little button here on the side that 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.880
 It's going to be the secret is this button and it's the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.860
 next you choose the rug of your 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.350
 color you want to understand what you 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 want blue yellow green what you 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.390
 prefer to come with the rug here in 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.320
 ready because the rug will not 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.990
 get in 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.700
 Unless you open the door, you can 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.810
 with a button here too to 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.030
 you can leave 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.940
 this is very interesting because 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.490
 if you can not get in and if the person 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.560
 Did you lose a button here too? 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.810
 Are you hiding, just let it in? 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.360
 You will not be able to leave either. 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.910
 You need to open the door to get out. 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.710
 Good crowd the last bud got this from here. 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.170
 which I think is one of the most epic 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.020
 exit to 10 as an elevator 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.850
 the fastest elevator minecraft would be 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.280
 sort of an elevator and I'll try 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.140
 get up there with him, huh? 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.500
 then just make a structure that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.140
 shrouded in tnt time and throwing water in the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.090
 medium is very simple that the rules 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.530
 It's all for everyone to explode at the same time. 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.160
 time and let's see if I will get 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.890
 reach the top of that business with this 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.380
 here with this explosion, then 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.440
 You'll see what time it comes right here. 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:45.959
 there it was ox 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:48.540
 my god calm not to reach did not 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.600
 sure I did not get there at the top but it goes 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.850
 too loud even for those who do not if I went 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.500
 too tall, much taller than that 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.290
 I just lost a bit of the notion 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.120
 right then you are making a withdrawal the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.150
 elevator if you do anything else 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.940
 It yields to him up there much more people 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.860
 because it goes very high up to the power 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.239
 very large but only that it has to be a 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.830
 thing right in front of him 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.140
 so this is it people if you like 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.940
 This video was 5 minecraft bugs that 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.250
 I find it very interesting that you can 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.799
 help you there in your gameplay in 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.690
 survivor in your series can help 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.640
 enough and do bring some content 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.260
 then I hope you have 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.510
