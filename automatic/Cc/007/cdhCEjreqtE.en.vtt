of the ones that I like antiperspirant

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
of the ones that I like antiperspirant
obviously<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> source<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.390> aluminum<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
obviously is a source of aluminum so I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
obviously is a source of aluminum so I
