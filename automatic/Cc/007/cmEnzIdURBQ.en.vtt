00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
 proven theories 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.940
 the most likely 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.150
 how about friends here will be the end one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 of the emblems that has been the most 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.470
 lost in my channel curiously I have 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 asked for several animals but the one that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.580
 highlights is the dragon this time 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 I bring a dragon itself but I bring them 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.600
 a dragon eye which I hope you 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 Thank quite well by the fact 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.220
 which is my first animated emblem and with 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.989
 this I mean is more friends I'm not going 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.190
 to comment on that right now better 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.570
 I invite you to have towards the end 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.880
 of the video so you know what I 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 I mean with an animated emblem also by 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.530
 On the other hand, I want to ask you a little bit of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.690
 patience because it's my first eye not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
 I'm very sure like that or I'm simple 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.720
 view I see it and say I stay well 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.460
 you are the ones that in the end is that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.619
 they have the word of one hundred of sara me 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 liked it out I did not like it but good 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.910
 I ask for patience because it's my first 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 young I do not know what it is that I have 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.600
 making emblems so good friends 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 then I will start now with the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.830
 tutorial are going to take this symbol and what 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 The only thing we want to achieve is the fact 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.369
 cover everything that is not in black 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 obviously everything except the center that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 is going to be the eye for that can do it 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.830
 with any symbol that you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.539
 want but in my case then take those 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.080
 which are the ones that I had at hand 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.600
 but you can do it with 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.580
 once you do this right now you are going to see 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.159
 how quickly I plug the bottom part 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.280
 A) Yes 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.810
 they are going to go to layer number 1 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.850
 after taking the symbol list 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.700
 half column is going to need it most 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.549
 that they can do as much as they can and what 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.530
 they're going to put that red color after 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.840
 they will double or you can also go to 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.359
 the page and take it again will go 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.700
 a little above 95 percent 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.700
 and a slightly stronger in red 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.070
 the first as you can see there I chose the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.990
 3 the fourth I think it was 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.590
 there modifying a bit the opacity of 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.950
 so that they stay like this 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.930
 that way now this is going to go to 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.269
 the layer right now a truth that layer 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.769
 that layer and they're going to take that symbol that 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.989
 it looks like a fang I'm not very 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.080
 sure of the name but they will do it 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.180
 little smaller with his right stick what 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.890
 they're going to make black and they're going to duplicate it and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.290
 can again take another as 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 you like to copy and paste already 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.129
 they know it's comeback and with start they go 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.080
 to do white and they will do it 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.840
 little bit more outside to determine what 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.760
 it stays as well as with a slight shine and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.579
 again right now they 're going to take the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.870
 symbol of the middle column and they will use 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.750
 nothing else 6 from layer 14 to the 19 go to 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 use this again that symbol they are going 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.489
 to stretch what they are going to do red this is a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.140
 your friends criterion because it's simply 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.420
 cover everything that is in black 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.489
 obviously not everything leaving a little 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.170
 a line out of the eye but what they go 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.269
 to do is copy and paste to copy and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.700
 stick in such a way that in six layers 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.709
 you cover everything black everything what 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.810
 more than they can and obviously for this 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.770
 they are going to use opacity some layers will 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.500
 those of 40 percent other than 35% 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.600
 others of the 25 that if I am ones a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.460
 little darker than others but the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.350
 case is that all the blacks 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.270
 I tell them I repeat here they do not have to 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.640
 to give you do not have to give them 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.230
 just like here in my design simply 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.200
 so that they cover everything as they are seeing their 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.020
 screens and with that right now they will see 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.510
 how in the end I will stay headquarter continue 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.090
 they keep going until they finish 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.549
 in such a way that they stay like this and now 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.200
 there are sorry if they jump of capturing 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.790
 I think I do not know sometimes that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.400
 I feel like he gets tired and that's why he does it 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 but I 'm not very sure and now they take 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.659
 that symbol they will normally do 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.549
 that his criteria of how much 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.280
 you prefer it in the cases that 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.709
 take two symbols use opacity one already 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.269
 whether they do it orange another red or 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.579
 even black of the color that you 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.019
 like it and they do it in the way that 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.579
 you like the way you 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.760
 so say I like the eye sees 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:13.020
 that if they leave it and there is no problem 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.420
 so they are watching me on their screens 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.820
 and now what we're going to do is give it 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.090
 more detail to what the dragon is for 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.080
 it does take this symbol in black 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.730
 obviously not going to take me opacity 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.720
 agreement how much to you but there they are going to 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.030
 see on your screens 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.130
 first of all let me show you no 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.090
 they have to turn like that and stretch it out 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.800
 that way 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.620
 will wear them will broadcast in our and 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.970
 they throw us until they have something left 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.020
 similar and use opacity and nothing else 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.020
 modifying a few things 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
 you are nothing more 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.569
 they have to adjust it as you 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.180
 convince if you say like that 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.150
 convince to well leave it and then 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.099
 of that they are going to take that symbol that 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.620
 llama acz in English is called ax in 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:02.110
 Spanish I do not know how this one but it's going to 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.740
 need it they will be black and it will go 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.379
 without memory it does not fail me is 38% of 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.280
 opacity is not going to go that way 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:14.889
 then they take another one but they turn it over and 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.139
 they put it just like that again it's going to 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.139
 vary in color black and with opacity 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.800
 and you can see how he uses it so that 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.889
 nothing more is accommodated until 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.729
 also you say like that I like it 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.650
 and ready you make it smaller bigger 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.830
 to your taste 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.340
 in that way and to finish this 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.039
 emblem friends are going to take that I think that 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.810
 they are lord who is praying they take and what 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.849
 it is black and obviously they are going to use 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.979
 again opacity 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.099
 one is going to go down another one goes in the part of 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.099
 above 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.100
 that way either again 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.860
 copy and paste with back and with start or 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.450
 well, take the figure again 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.340
 so that you do not get confused and 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.500
 nothing what I do there are times that if nothing 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.970
 more copy and paste but most of the 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.740
 I try always to take again 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.780
 the figure because they have come to me like 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.480
 those who tell me hears Sara but like that 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.670
 in your emblems you do not explain it too 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.110
 so be trying to improve a 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.490
 little that part because I do not know there are times 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.560
 that I think is not so necessary that 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.300
 I commented on the emblem but there 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.040
 I was talking with some friends and I 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.750
 they said if it's the best comment more like 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.510
 of how to do the design and I said good ok 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.790
 this one you ask so I'm 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.980
 commenting on the tutorial and good 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.600
 friends is the design and now yes to what 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.340
 I'm going to be good but before showing them to 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.660
 what do I mean with animated I want 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.640
 tell them they can change the design 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.590
 with you want in terms of color 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.150
 as to more than anything regarding the 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.670
 color can make it green can 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.770
 do it blue as you can see here is a 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.570
 clear example of how you can change it 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.580
 and what I mean by good 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.540
 animated is that they will remove the four 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.040
 first layers one 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.800
 3. 4 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.650
 press save to save and 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.600
 apply to your player card and I want to 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.310
 that they see how it is going to see obviously 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.950
 they have to choose the player card 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.460
 of the dragon coming here as it goes to 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.680
 see obviously here does not look so much in what 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.810
 that is the card but when they use the 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.450
 dragon player card what is going to 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.340
 see is the flames pass through the eye or 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.560
 it's going to be like an animated emblem to that 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.140
 I was referring and good friends here is like 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.600
 you look at your weapon as you can see it 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.100
 pretty well I liked it a lot and it's 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.350
 To tell you more, I recommend you the 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.480
 dragon camouflage to look 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.010
 even better I say goodbye to friends and for 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.970
 please give a like if it's taste is 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.970
 we'll see you too
