 the age of course 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.070
 If you start dumb earlier it means and should be ahead of talent 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.250
 but Percent was also a camp for DS percent which is more the youngest 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 it is still very creative 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 you have to put things into perspective so far so when it comes to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 Creativity works 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.970
 GM 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.770

 and shows so much creativity 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 then it does not promise much for the future 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.610
 I can sort the situation kinds so 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.080
 it's version is sixth, they attracting march in the end must be good 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.850
 fit and they have not fit side if it is still relatively elastic

 Nose at the state he said 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830
 spent five hours on the hours 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.170
 not the best run all the time 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.170
 Super that has no place 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.060
 As a musician especially strong is a live band Freiburg plays all this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.329

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.660
 unfortunately not proven 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.180
 Obama started as well 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.240
 from claus-peter had also liked that and I think it's good 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.860
 ran 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.860
 and sure I was up 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.140
 Kreismeister 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.119
 it's all up 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.119
 the like-for-like 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.770
 the work tells that one is criticized at the beginning as' just a by 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.949

 from the Leyen

 should be doing very funny stuff for the summer 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.630
