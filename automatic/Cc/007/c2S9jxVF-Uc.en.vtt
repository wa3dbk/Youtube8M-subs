00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.260

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.480
 cheese commodities novelty of the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.390
 makeup line from elizabeth to 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.780

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.579
 represent very well the values of the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.340
 New York woman and why she has known 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.110
 transmit to the rest of the world is going to 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.559
 love the makeup that will make you 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.719
 I leave with cardigan hello victor today I'll leave 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.030
 to teach how to use an illuminating base 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.100
 and corrector but it is very important 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.890
 start with a clean and good complexion 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.410
 moisturizer in my loved health sermas 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.880
 kapsos is beta order because of doing 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.860
 light luminous skin and super silky 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.920
 I like an afternoon in the hand 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.170
 and heat it because when you heat it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.960
 help much easier than penetrating the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.750
 skin I like to start at the center of the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.330
 face 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.300
 next to the eyes these are points 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.010
 where there is a lot of movement 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.010
 now let's use with the base 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.680
 and it's the end is perfect pass of the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 vectors 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.740
 I love using it in several ways 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 you can use with your hands or with the brush 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.580
 and I'm going to use I'm going to teach you how to use 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.770
 both ways 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.170
 I like to be with my hands because it is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.710
 a more natural way you feel and be 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.630
 natural although the base is super natural 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.630
 I always start in the center of the face 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.580
 because normally where there is a lot is 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.970
 coloring and now I like to use the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.970
 brush 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.040
 I use the brush because it gives more coverage 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.680
 the normal mind always in the center of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.050
 the face because where there are more than 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.180
 coloring by the environment I'm going to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.550
 use the corrector flowers you have 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.690
 illuminate and corrector in the afternoon 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.230
 and I start and here below the eyebrow next 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230
 nose 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.250
 and the dow to the pupil between the cheekbone 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.280
 and the eye and then using my finger what 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.270
 blurred 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.010
 If you want to add more you can always use 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.870
 the brush 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.379
 that also very easily is fulmina 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.290
 but you see that this color helps the 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.080
 correction of eye irregularity 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.750
 then you can use illuminator flow the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.120
 strain exist the challenges go this what 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.909
 use in certain points of the face to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.860
 those contours to highlight the outline 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.650
 Of the face 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.040
 I always start from the center of the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.819
 nose almost to the tip 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.390
 and then discriminated with my finger 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.109
 and then to highlight the cheekbones and 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.080
 eye I start where the eye arch is or 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.500
 of the eyebrow I will say 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.830
 going around like an ace on the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.370
 cheekbone up to the pupil and then using 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.520
 my finger to blur another point that I 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.370
 like to accept the contours of the face 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.570
 that is the center of the mouth so that the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.570
 lip be involved 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.760
 and also under the lip in the form of h 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.760
 next to the mouth and in the center 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.959
 and then it's always fulminate with me 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.540
 finger and I like to use the ring finger 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.390
 because it 's the one he has because he's the one 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.520
 has the softest touch now for 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.480
 fix the base 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.050
 I like to use the powder 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.909
 when I set the face normally not fixed 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.669
 the whole clear face that can do it 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:22.120
 but for a bright and more modern look 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.560
 nothing more fixed the center of the face and what 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.560
 I do on palms and you are very soft 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.070
 Now the other side of the sponge me 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.460
 like to use it as a form of its mining 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.250
 especially next to the mouth 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.860
 and it's also fantastic under the eye 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.199
 to never add a lot of dust 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.340
 now I will add blush always 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.259
 like to use a brush to talk a little 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.479
 Esther can always smile the way 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:57.680
 easier to find where to put the 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:01.250
 blush when smiling is where the pupil is 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.349
 until the shape of the eyebrow never touching 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.349
 the hair on soft cheekbones 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.600
 so it gives a very natural look 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.360
 Now I'm going to show you how to finish the 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.060
 look with the lip liner and the 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.560
 lip can use the eyeliner in 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.830
 espetar in viru focal lechleiter 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.800
 I always start in the center of the mouth 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.680
 like in the form of X 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.849
 to well accentuate the needle as a 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.860
 heart after a crescent and always 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.530
 I come from the corners up 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.409
 because if I go from top to bottom to 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.400
 move the smallest mouth and when 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.379
 I do I do it sideways never directly so 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.710
 It is not a strong line but something good 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.689
 blurred and also below the 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.869
 corners 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:59.509
 towards the center and the designer has a 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:02.349
 brush on the other end to put 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.349
 the labial 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.999
 and the lipstick should always go on top of the 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.849
 lumberjack should never see the difference 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:16.129
 and that's the number 17 lipstick 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.129
 kiss in purifier in the color 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.310
 Well, this is all for today 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.520
 just thank you to burst the 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.650
