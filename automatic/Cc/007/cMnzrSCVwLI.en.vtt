each<00:02:17.769> engine<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.310> crack<00:02:18.579> happened<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
each engine and that crack happened on a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.059 
each engine and that crack happened on a
dyno<00:02:19.420> yep<00:02:20.079> all<00:02:20.319> right<00:02:20.410> well<00:02:20.590> we'll<00:02:20.739> get<00:02:20.860> this

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
dyno yep all right well we'll get this

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.979 
dyno yep all right well we'll get this
old<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.579> off<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.269> we're<00:02:22.599> gonna<00:02:22.750> show<00:02:22.959> you

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
old one off and we're gonna show you

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.050 
old one off and we're gonna show you
what<00:02:23.110> we're<00:02:23.319> gonna<00:02:23.410> replace<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.040> with<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.430> love

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
what we're gonna replace it with I love

now Garrett what's the difference

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.009 
now Garrett what's the difference
between<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.150> two<00:02:37.329> what's<00:02:37.599> this<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.930> all

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
between the two what's this one all

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.119

beautiful welding absolutely nice piece

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.180 
beautiful welding absolutely nice piece
you<00:02:55.900> know<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.019> that's<00:02:56.200> important<00:02:56.829> too<00:02:57.010> with

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
you know and that's important too with

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.920 
you know and that's important too with
these<00:02:57.340> things<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.850> can<00:02:58.030> tell<00:02:58.209> right<00:02:58.239> now<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
these things I can tell right now is the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.330 
these things I can tell right now is the
port's<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.290> little<00:02:59.470> bit<00:02:59.560> bigger<00:02:59.769> on<00:02:59.889> it<00:03:00.040> but<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
port's a little bit bigger on it but the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.640 
port's a little bit bigger on it but the
but<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:00.850> angles<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.780> have<00:03:02.049> in<00:03:02.380> there

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
but the angles that you have in there

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.920 
but the angles that you have in there
you<00:03:03.130> know<00:03:03.250> they're<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> lot<00:03:03.579> less<00:03:04.269> severe<00:03:04.720> which

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
you know they're a lot less severe which

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.500 
you know they're a lot less severe which
lets<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.380> exhaust<00:03:06.130> gas<00:03:06.370> flow<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.760> lot<00:03:07.060> easier

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
lets that exhaust gas flow a lot easier

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.780 
lets that exhaust gas flow a lot easier
a<00:03:07.540> lot<00:03:07.720> faster<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.889> I<00:03:08.980> guess<00:03:09.190> when<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.579> flows

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
a lot faster and I guess when it flows

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.849 
a lot faster and I guess when it flows
faster<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:10.750> doesn't<00:03:11.049> generate<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.500> heat<00:03:11.620> does

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
faster it doesn't generate the heat does

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.250 
faster it doesn't generate the heat does
it<00:03:12.010> know<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.880> turns<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.540> turbo<00:03:13.840> charges

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
it know that it turns the turbo charges

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.110 
it know that it turns the turbo charges

it all wrapped into this turbo housing

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.290 
it all wrapped into this turbo housing
spitting<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.889> turbo<00:04:53.400> wheel<00:04:53.639> now<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.090> can

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
spitting that turbo wheel now you can

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.060 
spitting that turbo wheel now you can
see<00:04:54.449> over<00:04:54.479> here<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.440> where<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.860> have

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
see over here this is where you have

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
see over here this is where you have
your<00:04:56.099> fresh<00:04:56.520> air<00:04:56.760> coming<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.389> what's

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
your fresh air coming in what's

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.600 
your fresh air coming in what's
happening<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.650> compressor<00:04:59.190> now<00:04:59.370> is

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
happening is this compressor now is

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.150 
happening is this compressor now is
pressurizing<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.780> air<00:05:01.020> forcing<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.130> through

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
pressurizing that air forcing it through

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.520 
pressurizing that air forcing it through
this<00:05:02.490> pipe<00:05:02.820> right<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.349> into<00:05:04.349> this

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
this pipe right here into this

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.800 
this pipe right here into this
turbocharger<00:05:05.430> compressor<00:05:05.570> now<00:05:06.570> you've<00:05:06.720> got

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
turbocharger compressor now you've got

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.540 
turbocharger compressor now you've got
compressed<00:05:07.229> air<00:05:07.470> flowing<00:05:07.740> into<00:05:07.979> here<00:05:08.400> and

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
compressed air flowing into here and

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.670 
compressed air flowing into here and
then<00:05:09.120> that's<00:05:09.360> compressing<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.169> even<00:05:10.410> more

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
then that's compressing and even more

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.279 
then that's compressing and even more
then<00:05:11.580> goes<00:05:11.880> out<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.300> your<00:05:12.419> intake<00:05:12.750> into<00:05:13.110> your

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
then goes out to your intake into your

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.659 
then goes out to your intake into your
manifold<00:05:13.889> yep<00:05:14.070> goes<00:05:14.250> right<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
manifold yep goes right to the

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.210 
manifold yep goes right to the
intercooler<00:05:15.030> now<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.810> see<00:05:16.229> this<00:05:16.620> looks<00:05:16.889> like<00:05:17.010> it

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
intercooler now I see this looks like it

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.770 
intercooler now I see this looks like it
might<00:05:17.400> be<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.639> bill<00:05:17.880> at<00:05:18.000> we<00:05:18.120> love<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.510> billet

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
might be a bill at we love that billet

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.150 
might be a bill at we love that billet
that<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> bill<00:05:19.470> in<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.680> what's<00:05:20.099> the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
that is a bill in that what's the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.760 
that is a bill in that what's the
advantage<00:05:20.400> over<00:05:20.699> a<00:05:20.820> billet<00:05:21.349> compressor<00:05:22.349> will

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
advantage over a billet compressor will

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.760 
advantage over a billet compressor will
over<00:05:23.430> actually<00:05:23.789> affords<00:05:24.270> or<00:05:24.449> a<00:05:24.720> cash<00:05:25.560> point

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
over actually affords or a cash point

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.469 
over actually affords or a cash point
they<00:05:26.010> can<00:05:26.159> be<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.310> lighter<00:05:26.550> lighter<00:05:26.849> they<00:05:27.330> also

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
they can be a lighter lighter they also

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.180
