00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.090 
about it so can't think of anything else
really<00:02:51.440> productive<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:53.570> talk<00:02:54.050> about<00:02:57.100> I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
really productive to talk about I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.960 
really productive to talk about I
noticed<00:02:58.910> on<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.090> sleigh<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.350> back<00:03:00.620> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.170 

directional<00:03:05.020> selector<00:03:06.020> for<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:07.370> automatic

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
directional selector for the automatic

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.060 
directional selector for the automatic
feed<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:10.190> couldn't<00:03:10.910> move<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.890> reason

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
feed I couldn't move it and the reason

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.870 
feed I couldn't move it and the reason
is<00:03:13.490> is<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:15.230> spring<00:03:15.770> operated<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.700> got<00:03:16.850> to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
is is the spring operated and you got to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.580 
is is the spring operated and you got to
pull<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.450> handle<00:03:17.870> out<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:21.320> pretty

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
pull the handle out and it's pretty

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.280 
pull the handle out and it's pretty
tight<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.310> gotta<00:03:22.580> pull<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.540> out<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.959> move

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
tight so you gotta pull it out and move

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.460 
tight so you gotta pull it out and move
it<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.590> or<00:03:24.739> down<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.340> get<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.120> move<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:29.470> that

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
it up or down to get it to move so that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.560 
it up or down to get it to move so that
was<00:03:30.650> one<00:03:30.860> issue<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:33.850> can't<00:03:34.850> think<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.300> really

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
was one issue I can't think of really

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.020
