00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
i'll try and break it down and make it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.810 
i'll try and break it down and make it
as<00:00:46.320> clear<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.710> possible<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> guys<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.760> i

unders<00:03:00.959> triggered<00:03:01.440> by<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> contact<00:03:02.610> visit<00:03:02.819> and

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
unders triggered by a contact visit and

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.750 
unders triggered by a contact visit and
again<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.470> shoot<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.890> kill<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
again it is shoot to kill so I think it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.330 
again it is shoot to kill so I think it
is<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.090> mission<00:03:06.660> between<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.860> cops<00:03:08.099> to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
is a mission between you and the cops to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.430 
is a mission between you and the cops to
get<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.790> news<00:03:09.090> van<00:03:09.120> maybe<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.780> cops<00:03:09.989> have<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.319> be

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
get a news van maybe the cops have to be

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.380 
get a news van maybe the cops have to be
trying<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.739> be<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> news<00:03:11.220> team<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.970> try<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
trying to be the news team you try and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.940 
trying to be the news team you try and
steal<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.810> correct<00:03:13.140> van<00:03:13.319> if<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> steal<00:03:13.829> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
steal the correct van if you steal the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.530 
steal the correct van if you steal the
wrong<00:03:14.099> one<00:03:14.280> obviously<00:03:14.610> you're<00:03:14.790> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.060> get

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
wrong one obviously you're going to get

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.910 
wrong one obviously you're going to get
into<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> battle<00:03:16.140> with<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.349> cops<00:03:16.590> I'm<00:03:16.769> not

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
into the battle with the cops I'm not

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.440 
into the battle with the cops I'm not
too<00:03:17.069> sure<00:03:17.340> about<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.760> mission<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.209> kind<00:03:18.420> of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
too sure about this mission it's kind of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
too sure about this mission it's kind of
confusing<00:03:18.660> but<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.380> think<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.739> goes<00:03:19.889> somewhere

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
confusing but I think it goes somewhere

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.849 
confusing but I think it goes somewhere
along<00:03:20.700> them<00:03:21.120> lines<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.019> also<00:03:22.170> says<00:03:22.560> steal

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
along them lines and it also says steal

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.410 
along them lines and it also says steal
the<00:03:23.040> cop<00:03:23.250> car<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.700> maybe<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.299> either

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the cop car so maybe you can either

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.150 
the cop car so maybe you can either
choose<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:25.139> straight<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.739> news<00:03:25.950> van

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
choose to go straight for the news van

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.650

hundred<00:03:45.690> percent<00:03:45.989> sure<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.829> true<00:03:47.069> but

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
hundred percent sure that it is true but

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.860 
hundred percent sure that it is true but
