 there does 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 what's happened 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.359
 Last week about the week of leisure safety in the course of this 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.839

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.179
 climbing enthusiastic stood the whole thing seems a focus action 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.369
 be addressed 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.869
 this resulted from a meeting with the old people occupied so the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.199
 the emerged avoids very satisfied quarters of respondents 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 Representatives of the two local organizations then have the sport 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.100
 advised on the one hand he leads me as the glued already percent 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.020
 On the way they are already doing the sport 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.040

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.400
 Spot bodies from here climbing has become a trend in recent years 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.580
 and sometimes even developed for recreational sports 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.550
 hardly surprising influenced by positive health effects 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.330
 harmonious with the fun factor 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.900
 provided, however, one comes back salvation from the mountain and that is exactly what 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.090
 the safety on the mountain was the detector at the climbing garden Boxberg 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.290
 foremost 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.140
 it is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.600
 if it is working properly the networks hard he does not have to turn back on 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 but of course, if you learned it as many Kline 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.320
 He has a company because it is so much more independent 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.470
 Basically everyone's sheep is already its own because of its own 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.210
 Task of hard course percent overlap the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.750
 Responsibilities honors Kötz summer Bad Vilbel we do not have that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.010
 all strive together for this security 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.870
 if so 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.400
 Prevention measures 19 nations in one strand if there are people Christophorus 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.110
 divide 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.020
 Besides that was also that the climbing gardens Schwarzenberg and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.350
 be shouldered 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.170
 which acted for that purpose that day responsible for the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.409
 sales team hopes the team manager of the Alpine Club of CS 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.170
 this 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.630
 is under the direction of chairman Hannes message and that with 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 Help that regularly arose the target has her clapper Schaeffler 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.430
 check reason has to deny that everything is okay director 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.410
 Criticism that makes you aware that you are teaching as well 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.269
 unaffiliated from served 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.989
 Peter Liechti very important the increasing interest in this sport 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.879
 has now called the Alpine organizations on the scene 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.209
 and bent for the first time to organize a focus day on the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.230
 Interested parties are free and, above all, practice-oriented 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.889
 to be able to inform 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.669
 beside the initiative safe communities of the alpine school uphill and downhill 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:39.049

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.510
 Vorarlberg responsible for the organization on this day 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.680
 For all organizations, preventive work is the preventive one 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.709
 Empowering work on safety issues is important 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 so also for the alpine police Christoph Redeker informed next to the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.310
 Preventive work also on the day-to-day work of the alpine police 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:04.549
 the alpine police light important contribution to the prevention of the 1 0 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.529
 by 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.389
 the culmination in the environment she is working up the causes 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.649
 the community is understandable 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.829
 Feelings ways of the Board of Trustees for Alpine Safety 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.110
 that always very much interested and to realize the organizer 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.449
 So some climbers climbed who gave her many clicks and 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.810
 Tricks in dealing with ropes Express lengths before attacks 4 1 and 4 of 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:30.539
 Apple 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:34.100
 because one has not learned poets always interesting 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.800
 Kalixtus safety regulations without gong and the Würzjoch lead 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.420
 the storm and for me to print fresh great five bridges too 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.539
 follow 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.509
 Even the emergency was impressively demonstrated, but if you at one 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.499
 Climbing Climbing Climbing or even located on a rock 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:56.069
 and it really enters the emergency case so an alpine accident then that is 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.779
 proper action is necessary 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.219
 the first on the scene are the women and men of the mountain rescue hunts 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.509
 Dr Hartmut Rufmord 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.699
 not round 44 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.959
 and 50 commander to Feldkirch to rescue the case of the control center 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:16.199
 the respective dispatcher will hire the dt Graf what I have so far from 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.500
 the whole five to ten accidents he had put in front of him 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.400
 4 prompt 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 we act on the whole environment fits in HD 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.029
 and percent the rescue chain 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.339
 Often the entry into a new sport is the decisive factor 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.009
 subsequent safety 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.099
 We already have a lot of euros to go from the alpine school uphill 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.439
 go downhill 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.269
 that means you can either at an alpine last at the old club 

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:47.599
 or report to the Friends of Nature Vorarlberg 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.090
 because the program is wide-ranging 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.539
 for the Friends of Nature Vorarlberg and Vienna 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.749
 nine local groups and the very diverse program of hiking 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.330
 for private teams in Möhringen to run by media 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.120
 on activities for children and adolescents on safety issues 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.860
 hardly would have been attacked 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.669
 Adler had around training 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.150
 The bottom line, however, is safety over and over again 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.770
 that is safety first, before the mountain has to commit an anger 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.889
 properly planned the equipment must be able to cast the weather and vote 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.100
 You should not rely on coincidences should your interest in 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.280
 climbing and having grown or should you have any questions get them all 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.350
 needed information among others on the homepage www compass safe 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.350
 Communities point deductions Esprit 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.949
 it's perfect
