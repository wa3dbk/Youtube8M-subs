00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.429 
recommend a lean kernel and if you go
into<00:01:25.710> general<00:01:26.630> you'll<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.780> able<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.080> overclock

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
into general you'll be able to overclock

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
into general you'll be able to overclock
it<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:29.939> I've<00:01:30.060> got<00:01:30.180> an

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it here and you can see I've got an

overclocked to 2.7 2 gigahertz alright
the<00:01:35.579> minimum<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> different<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> doesn't

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the minimum is different but it doesn't

the minimum is different but it doesn't
really<00:01:36.930> matter<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.470> set<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> little

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
really matter I can set this a little

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
really matter I can set this a little
bit<00:01:38.189> higher<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.689> sure<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> hit<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
bit higher and make sure you hit this

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
bit higher and make sure you hit this
button<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.040> after<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.909> set<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> alright

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
button up here after you set it alright

button up here after you set it alright
and<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> set<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.909> boot

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and also if you want to set it on boot

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.630 
and also if you want to set it on boot
make<00:01:45.540> sure<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.110> set<00:01:46.409> kernel<00:01:47.009> settings<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
make sure you set kernel settings that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
make sure you set kernel settings that
way<00:01:47.790> after<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.270> boots<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.350> automatically

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
way after it boots it will automatically

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
way after it boots it will automatically
set<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> back<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:51.000> overclockable

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
set it back to the your overclockable

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.840 
set it back to the your overclockable
speeds<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.799> here's<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.280> thing<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.549> did

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
speeds now here's one thing I did

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.450 
speeds now here's one thing I did
different<00:01:54.360> um<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.860> overclock<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
different um if you just overclock it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.819 
different um if you just overclock it
the<00:01:56.880> thing<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.439> when<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> run<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the thing is that when you run the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.980 
the thing is that when you run the
benchmark<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.460> won't<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.450> won't<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.719> won't

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
benchmark it won't you won't you won't

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.300 
benchmark it won't you won't you won't
do<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.290> well<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.979> phone<00:02:02.130> gets

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
do as well just because the phone gets

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609 
do as well just because the phone gets
super<00:02:02.579> hot<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.509> trick<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.380> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
super hot one little trick you can do is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
super hot one little trick you can do is
going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.500> specific<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> go

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
going to specific here and if you go

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.890 
going to specific here and if you go
down<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:10.770> voltage<00:02:11.220> I'll<00:02:11.580> tone<00:02:12.480> down<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
down to the voltage I'll tone down the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850 
down to the voltage I'll tone down the
voltage<00:02:13.319> from

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
voltage from

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.280 
voltage from
eleven<00:02:14.340> seventy<00:02:14.910> what's<00:02:15.330> defaults<00:02:15.900> out<00:02:16.050> to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
eleven seventy what's defaults out to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.980 
eleven seventy what's defaults out to
11:45<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.550> hit<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.540> should<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.960> that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
11:45 just hit so it should be like that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.260 
11:45 just hit so it should be like that
just<00:02:19.230> hit<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.830> button<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.460> set<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
just hit that button right there set and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.120 
just hit that button right there set and
hit<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.690> button<00:02:21.870> what<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:22.860> do<00:02:23.100> is

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
hit that button what that will do is

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.400 
hit that button what that will do is
allow<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.480> full<00:02:24.810> two<00:02:25.170> point

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
allow you to get that full two point

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.730 
allow you to get that full two point
seven<00:02:25.800> two<00:02:26.040> six<00:02:26.340> gigahertz<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.690> allows<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
seven two six gigahertz and allows it to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.220 
seven two six gigahertz and allows it to
not<00:02:29.400> overheat<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.030> also<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.960> best

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
not overheat and also get you the best

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170 
not overheat and also get you the best
performance<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.950> did<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.460> bunch<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.790> tests<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
performance I did a bunch of tests and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.390 
performance I did a bunch of tests and
that<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> perfect<00:02:33.900> voltage<00:02:34.650> setting<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that was the perfect voltage setting so

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.190 
that was the perfect voltage setting so
it's<00:02:35.550> sort<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.850> under<00:02:36.180> voting<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.990> also

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it's sort of under voting and that also

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.440 
it's sort of under voting and that also
save<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:37.830> battery<00:02:38.100> life<00:02:38.250> um<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.210> let's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
save you some battery life um so let's

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.510 
save you some battery life um so let's
go<00:02:39.630> ahead<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.080> do<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> test<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
go ahead and do a test with that and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.920 
go ahead and do a test with that and
I've<00:02:42.090> also<00:02:42.330> got<00:02:42.720> lollipop<00:02:43.500> running<00:02:44.600> 5.0.1<00:02:45.600> on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
I've also got lollipop running 5.0.1 on

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.750 
I've also got lollipop running 5.0.1 on
my<00:02:46.080> note<00:02:46.380> 4<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.890> we're<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:47.670> ahead

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
my note 4 and we're going to go ahead

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.100 
my note 4 and we're going to go ahead
head<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.960> head<00:02:49.280> note<00:02:50.280> 3<00:02:50.520> vs<00:02:50.940> note<00:02:51.120> 4<00:02:51.420> all<00:02:51.959> right

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.510 
head to head note 3 vs note 4 all right
here<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.440> moment<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.950> truth<00:02:53.010> we're<00:02:53.400> going

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
here is the moment of truth we're going

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.960 
here is the moment of truth we're going
to<00:02:53.580> go<00:02:53.670> ahead<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.090> run<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.570> 2<00:02:54.810> 2<00:02:55.700> for<00:02:56.700> all<00:02:56.850> of

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
to go ahead and run and 2 2 for all of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.010 
to go ahead and run and 2 2 for all of
them<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:58.500> how<00:02:58.590> they<00:02:58.770> end<00:02:58.800> up<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.430> oh

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
them and see how they end up here oh

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.360 
them and see how they end up here oh
those<00:03:01.020> are<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> scores<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.680> let<00:03:02.040> me<00:03:02.100> run<00:03:02.280> it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
those are the scores but let me run it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.250 
those are the scores but let me run it
again<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:05.150> see<00:03:06.150> how<00:03:06.270> they<00:03:06.450> well<00:03:06.690> they<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.400> yeah

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
again and see how they well they do yeah

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.410 
again and see how they well they do yeah
all<00:03:10.260> right<00:03:10.380> there<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.709> I'm<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:11.850> fast<00:03:12.180> for

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
all right there we go I'm so fast for

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.630 
all right there we go I'm so fast for
this<00:03:12.600> now<00:03:13.050> one<00:03:13.230> thing<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.470> note<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.459> note

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
this now one thing to note that the note

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.750 
this now one thing to note that the note
4<00:03:14.940> does<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.690> disadvantage<00:03:16.500> because<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.550> does

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
4 does have disadvantage because it does

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.420 
4 does have disadvantage because it does
have<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.290> 1440p<00:03:19.290> screen<00:03:19.680> instead<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:19.980> 1080p

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
have a 1440p screen instead of 1080p

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.550 
have a 1440p screen instead of 1080p
screen<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.480> benchmarks<00:03:21.930> are<00:03:22.050> will<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.350> a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
screen so the benchmarks are will be a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.540 
screen so the benchmarks are will be a
little<00:03:22.890> bit<00:03:22.980> off

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
little bit off

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.430 
little bit off
not<00:03:24.000> off<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.690> going<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.989> little<00:03:25.290> bit

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
not off it's going to be a little bit

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.140 
not off it's going to be a little bit
slower<00:03:25.769> then<00:03:26.370> obviously<00:03:26.550> there's<00:03:26.940> more

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
slower then obviously there's more

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.630 
slower then obviously there's more
pixels<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.690> picks<00:03:27.900> even<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.920> i<00:03:28.950> mean<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.489> can

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
pixels to picks even then i mean you can

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.420 
pixels to picks even then i mean you can
get<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.940> note<00:03:30.120> 3<00:03:30.420> performance<00:03:31.100> almost<00:03:32.100> near

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
get the note 3 performance almost near

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.270 
get the note 3 performance almost near
of<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.730> note<00:03:32.940> 4<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.950> know<00:03:35.040> they're<00:03:35.190> all

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
of a note 4 and you know they're all

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.460 
of a note 4 and you know they're all
running<00:03:35.519> lollipop<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.420> it's<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.750> fair<00:03:37.019> contest

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
running lollipop so it's a fair contest

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.490 
running lollipop so it's a fair contest
and<00:03:38.220> also<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.910> know<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.570> scores<00:03:40.080> you'll<00:03:40.230> get

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
and also you know the scores you'll get

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.890 
and also you know the scores you'll get
the<00:03:41.130> performance<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.120> get<00:03:42.239> with<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> note<00:03:42.660> 3

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
the performance you get with the note 3

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.710 
the performance you get with the note 3
will<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.830> actually<00:03:44.340> pretty<00:03:45.000> much<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.420> par<00:03:45.690> with

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
will be actually pretty much on par with

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.110 
will be actually pretty much on par with
KitKat<00:03:46.350> running<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.800> node<00:03:46.950> 4<00:03:47.280> which<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.880> really

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
KitKat running on node 4 which is really

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.210 
KitKat running on node 4 which is really
nice<00:03:48.239> anyway<00:03:48.900> let's<00:03:49.440> go<00:03:49.560> ahead<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.800> fast<00:03:50.010> for

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.179 

alright<00:03:59.730> guys<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.060> results<00:04:00.510> are<00:04:00.629> in<00:04:01.189> 47,000

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189

alright guys the results are in 47,000
753<00:04:02.939> I<00:04:03.120> was<00:04:03.450> able<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.780> get<00:04:03.959> almost<00:04:04.110> like<00:04:04.340> 48,000

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
753 I was able to get almost like 48,000

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.110 
753 I was able to get almost like 48,000
tons<00:04:05.370> sometimes<00:04:06.000> almost<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:06.769> 49,000<00:04:07.769> no<00:04:08.760> force

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
tons sometimes almost so 49,000 no force

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.630 
tons sometimes almost so 49,000 no force
still<00:04:09.360> beat<00:04:09.599> out<00:04:09.780> at<00:04:10.189> 51,000<00:04:11.189> that's<00:04:11.310> actually

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
still beat out at 51,000 that's actually

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.360 
still beat out at 51,000 that's actually
one<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.790> my<00:04:11.879> best<00:04:12.150> results<00:04:12.689> so<00:04:12.780> far<00:04:13.099> but<00:04:14.099> as<00:04:14.220> you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
one of my best results so far but as you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.909 
one of my best results so far but as you
can<00:04:14.549> see<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.390> get<00:04:15.569> these<00:04:15.870> nice<00:04:16.410> really

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
can see you can get these nice really

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.860 
can see you can get these nice really
nice<00:04:17.070> scores<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.820> actual<00:04:18.120> test<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.750> can

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
nice scores but the actual test you can

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.479 
nice scores but the actual test you can
see<00:04:19.049> they<00:04:19.169> all<00:04:19.320> finish<00:04:19.680> about<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.100> same<00:04:20.280> time

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
see they all finish about the same time

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.610 
see they all finish about the same time
I<00:04:20.519> started<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.120> one<00:04:21.329> first<00:04:21.600> now<00:04:22.350> I'm<00:04:22.470> not

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
I started this one first now I'm not

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.409 
I started this one first now I'm not
sure<00:04:22.650> which<00:04:22.949> one<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.160> actually<00:04:23.699> started<00:04:24.210> but

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
sure which one I actually started but

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.689 
sure which one I actually started but
the<00:04:24.570> note<00:04:24.840> Note<00:04:25.710> 3<00:04:26.009> is<00:04:26.130> actually<00:04:26.250> finished

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
the note Note 3 is actually finished

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.999 
the note Note 3 is actually finished
first<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:27.720> as<00:04:27.870> far<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.289> speed<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.949> your

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
first so as far as the speed of your

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.300 
first so as far as the speed of your

note for overclock to 2.7 to 6 gigahertz

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.580 
note for overclock to 2.7 to 6 gigahertz
it's<00:04:33.270> going<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.510> be<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.780> par<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.410> note

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
it's going to be on par with the note

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.180 
it's going to be on par with the note
400

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
400

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.939 
400
almost<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.510> course<00:04:36.780> if<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.289> do<00:04:37.590> have<00:04:37.919> a

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
almost and of course if you do have a

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.279 
almost and of course if you do have a
note<00:04:38.250> 3<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.639> do<00:04:38.910> highly<00:04:39.389> recommend<00:04:39.419> see<00:04:40.110> if<00:04:40.169> you

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
note 3 I do highly recommend see if you

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.409 
note 3 I do highly recommend see if you
can<00:04:40.440> get<00:04:40.560> higher<00:04:40.800> score<00:04:41.250> than<00:04:41.280> these<00:04:41.760> but

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
can get higher score than these but

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.659 
can get higher score than these but
48-thousand<00:04:43.320> was<00:04:43.440> pretty<00:04:43.770> much<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.130> maximum

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
48-thousand was pretty much the maximum

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.029 
48-thousand was pretty much the maximum
limit<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.210> could<00:04:45.419> do<00:04:45.600> with<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.960> best<00:04:46.199> lollipop

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
limit I could do with the best lollipop

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.610 
limit I could do with the best lollipop
with<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> best<00:04:48.330> kernel<00:04:48.810> lean<00:04:49.080> kernel<00:04:49.440> and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
with the best kernel lean kernel and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.409 
with the best kernel lean kernel and
also<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.220> can<00:04:50.400> see<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.789> scores<00:04:51.120> are<00:04:51.240> nearly

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
also you can see the scores are nearly

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.010 
also you can see the scores are nearly
identical<00:04:51.570> for<00:04:52.410> CM<00:04:52.770> 12<00:04:53.190> or<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.180> TouchWiz<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.990> I

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
identical for CM 12 or the TouchWiz so I

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.450 
identical for CM 12 or the TouchWiz so I
feel<00:04:55.169> like<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.380> does<00:04:55.530> really<00:04:55.770> not<00:04:56.039> matter

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
feel like it does really not matter

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.580 
feel like it does really not matter
whether<00:04:56.729> you<00:04:56.849> run<00:04:57.120> TouchWiz<00:04:57.630> or<00:04:57.780> cm<00:04:58.080> 12<00:04:58.349> with

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
whether you run TouchWiz or cm 12 with

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.050 
whether you run TouchWiz or cm 12 with
overclocking<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.250> can<00:04:59.400> get<00:04:59.520> some<00:04:59.669> really

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
overclocking you can get some really

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.529 
overclocking you can get some really
nice<00:05:00.919> performance<00:05:01.919> boost<00:05:02.250> now<00:05:02.880> these<00:05:03.120> scores

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
nice performance boost now these scores

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.350 
nice performance boost now these scores
are<00:05:03.990> actually<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:05.010> on<00:05:05.190> par<00:05:05.550> with<00:05:05.580> KitKat

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
are actually just on par with KitKat

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.600 
are actually just on par with KitKat
running<00:05:06.660> on<00:05:06.780> Note<00:05:06.990> 4<00:05:07.289> so<00:05:07.919> there<00:05:08.099> you<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.280> it

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
running on Note 4 so there you have it

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.760 
running on Note 4 so there you have it
you<00:05:08.760> can<00:05:08.940> run<00:05:09.090> your<00:05:09.270> Note<00:05:09.510> 3<00:05:09.870> just<00:05:10.110> as<00:05:10.260> fast<00:05:10.530> as

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
you can run your Note 3 just as fast as

you can run your Note 3 just as fast as
the<00:05:11.340> note<00:05:11.550> 4<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.300> with<00:05:12.570> this<00:05:12.720> much

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
the note 4 and with this much

the note 4 and with this much
overclocking<00:05:13.800> your<00:05:14.370> battery<00:05:14.729> will<00:05:14.940> not<00:05:15.150> be<00:05:15.300> as

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
overclocking your battery will not be as

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.170 
overclocking your battery will not be as
good<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:17.039> will<00:05:17.220> still<00:05:17.520> be<00:05:17.550> better<00:05:17.909> than
