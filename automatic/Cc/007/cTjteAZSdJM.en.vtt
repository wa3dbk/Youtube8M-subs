okay here's 2007 Malibu has a display

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.230 
okay here's 2007 Malibu has a display
problem<00:00:07.620> during<00:00:07.859> bright<00:00:08.280> sunlight<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.000> can't

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
problem during bright sunlight you can't

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.100 
problem during bright sunlight you can't
see<00:00:09.510> anything<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.429> took<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> little<00:00:11.730> black<00:00:12.110> not

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
see anything I took the little black not

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.970 
see anything I took the little black not
black<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.710> smoky<00:00:14.250> glass<00:00:14.549> off<00:00:15.410> it<00:00:16.410> just<00:00:16.740> pops

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
black but smoky glass off it just pops

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.130 
black but smoky glass off it just pops
right<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:18.810> adhesive

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
right out of here see little adhesive

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.290 
right out of here see little adhesive
remains<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:22.310> took<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> razor<00:00:23.609> blade<00:00:23.910> actually

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
remains the took a razor blade actually

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.029 
remains the took a razor blade actually
I<00:00:24.539> took<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.960> whole<00:00:25.170> thing<00:00:25.350> apart<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.830> pushed

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
I took this whole thing apart and pushed

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.750 
I took this whole thing apart and pushed
it<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> back<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:28.010> razor<00:00:29.010> blade<00:00:29.369> can

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
it out from the back but razor blade can

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.200 
it out from the back but razor blade can
be<00:00:29.789> used<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.420> pry<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.470> right<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.759> rid<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
be used to pry it up right get rid of it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.940 
be used to pry it up right get rid of it
maybe<00:00:33.840> replace<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:34.920> some<00:00:35.190> black<00:00:36.950> covers

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
maybe replace it with some black covers

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.290 
maybe replace it with some black covers
this<00:00:38.250> area<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.079> clear<00:00:41.300> for

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this area up to here and then clear for

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.130 
this area up to here and then clear for
the<00:00:42.390> display<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> might<00:00:45.360> bring<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the display and that might bring out the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.549 
the display and that might bring out the
light<00:00:46.350> during<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> Sun<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.420> mean<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.629> display

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
light during the Sun I mean the display

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
light during the Sun I mean the display
during<00:00:50.010> bright<00:00:50.460> sunshine<00:00:51.000> enough<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.449> took

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
during bright sunshine enough I took

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
during bright sunshine enough I took
everything<00:00:52.710> apart<00:00:52.980> try<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> find<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
everything apart try to find a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
everything apart try to find a
photodiode<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.860> looks<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
photodiode and it looks like there is a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.650 
photodiode and it looks like there is a
photodiode<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:58.879> that<00:00:59.879> isn't<00:01:00.090> working

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
photodiode right here that isn't working

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.189 
photodiode right here that isn't working
now<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> photodiode<00:01:01.680> doesn't<00:01:02.160> work

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
now when the photodiode doesn't work

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.460 
now when the photodiode doesn't work
it's<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:05.159> thinks<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.790> night<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
it's it thinks that it's night and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.160 
it's it thinks that it's night and
therefore<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.830> keeps<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> display<00:01:08.760> dim<00:01:09.170> you

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
therefore it keeps the display dim you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.719 
therefore it keeps the display dim you
can't<00:01:10.409> sort<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.250> bright<00:01:11.460> daylight<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
can't sort see it in bright daylight and

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.210 
can't sort see it in bright daylight and
it<00:01:14.729> looks<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.540> could<00:01:16.290> replace<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:18.110> high

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
it looks like I could replace this high

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.340 
it looks like I could replace this high
voltage<00:01:20.220> display<00:01:22.070> by<00:01:23.070> desoldering<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.350> thing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
voltage display by desoldering the thing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.700 
voltage display by desoldering the thing
there's<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.860> 40<00:01:26.280> pins<00:01:26.549> back<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.289 

putting<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> new<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:32.939> cost<00:01:33.150> about

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
putting in a new one probably cost about

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.740 
putting in a new one probably cost about
50<00:01:33.780> bucks<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:35.119> don't<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.390> sure

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
50 bucks but I don't I'm not sure

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
50 bucks but I don't I'm not sure
there's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> photo<00:01:37.259> detector<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.070> there

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
there's a photo detector in there there

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
there's a photo detector in there there
has<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.020> working<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
has to be and it's not working and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.609 
has to be and it's not working and
that's<00:01:40.799> why<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.040> thinks<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.490> always<00:01:41.790> night

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
that's why it thinks it's always night

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's why it thinks it's always night
as<00:01:43.619> you've<00:01:43.950> probably<00:01:44.369> found<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.630> does<00:01:45.899> dim

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
as you've probably found out it does dim

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.630 
as you've probably found out it does dim
and<00:01:46.670> darken<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.000> master<00:01:48.479> dimmer<00:01:49.640> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and darken with the master dimmer so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.370 
and darken with the master dimmer so
there's<00:01:51.299> nothing<00:01:51.630> wrong<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.700> Chevys

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
there's nothing wrong with the Chevys

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
there's nothing wrong with the Chevys
master<00:01:55.380> dimming<00:01:56.130> system<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.350> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
master dimming system on this it just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.450 
master dimming system on this it just
has<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> photo<00:01:59.670> dot<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.479> doesn't<00:02:00.930> see

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
has a photo dot in there doesn't see

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.179 
has a photo dot in there doesn't see
that<00:02:02.460> there's<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.350> bright<00:02:04.350> sunlight<00:02:04.890> during

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that there's a bright sunlight during

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.999 
that there's a bright sunlight during
the<00:02:05.310> day<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.090> doesn't<00:02:06.799> give<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the day so it doesn't give you the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.679 
the day so it doesn't give you the
brighter<00:02:08.310> option

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.629 

you<00:02:13.689> don't<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.200> take<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.560> radio<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:14.980> to

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:15.639 
you don't have to take the radio out to

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.039 
you don't have to take the radio out to
do<00:02:15.819> what<00:02:16.030> I'm<00:02:16.150> suggesting<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.480> did<00:02:19.870> anyway

if you want to know how to do that

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.259 
if you want to know how to do that

has<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> clip<00:02:41.680> up<00:02:41.859> there<00:02:42.129> as<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:43.950> it's

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
has a clip up there as you can see it's

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.229 
has a clip up there as you can see it's
a<00:02:45.099> bitch<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.669> out<00:02:47.129> but<00:02:48.129> yeah<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:49.060> don't

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
a bitch to get out but yeah I don't

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.539 
a bitch to get out but yeah I don't
think<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.719> don't<00:02:50.560> think<00:02:50.859> you<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.099> fix<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.489> that

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
think I don't think you can fix it that

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.559 
think I don't think you can fix it that
easy<00:02:51.909> that's<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.730> there's<00:02:54.969> a<00:02:55.030> problem

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
easy that's it if there's a problem

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.349 
easy that's it if there's a problem
wrong<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.409> problems<00:02:56.919> in<00:02:57.219> this<00:02:57.430> circuit<00:02:58.120> board

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
wrong the problems in this circuit board

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.309 
wrong the problems in this circuit board
inside<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.319> display<00:02:59.620> circuit<00:03:00.099> board<00:03:00.400> and

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
inside the display circuit board and

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.800 
inside the display circuit board and
that<00:03:02.319> has<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.799> replaced<00:03:03.449> maybe<00:03:04.449> somebody

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
that has to be replaced maybe somebody

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.909 
that has to be replaced maybe somebody
can<00:03:04.930> add<00:03:05.169> information<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:06.069> this<00:03:06.310> video<00:03:06.669> and

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
can add information to this video and

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.900 
can add information to this video and
instruct<00:03:09.150> how<00:03:10.150> they<00:03:10.389> fixed<00:03:10.840> it
