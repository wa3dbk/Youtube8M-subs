00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello today we're going to learn this dish so 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.740
 original and fun for our 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.279
 smaller ones can have dinner 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.380
 in a more beautiful way as you see 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.050
 it's just a fried egg with 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.869
 sausages that form a flower I hope 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.210
 that you like to make our flower 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.369
 this dinner so fun for our 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.910
 smaller everything we're going to 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.309
 need is an egg a sausage that 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.949
 As you can see, we have broken into pieces of 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.920
 this way a little fat not 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.199
 too thin and then to decorate 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.370
 just a little bit of ketchup that 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.590
 with which we are going to make the forms 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.239
 First let's put some 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.540
 oil to heat in the pan to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.080
 to be able to make our egg 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.620
 on high heat and a splash of oil 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.690
 enough 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.460
 the oil is hot let's take 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.590
 our egg we have to try that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.760
 be clear around the yolk 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.260
 all sides 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 if that is a bit difficult you can 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 help you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 a house with a time 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 they put us sausage extras 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 we will make the egg as normally with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.060
 Be careful not to fall so that you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.060
 are well attached to the yolk to the white 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 Well, we have taken our egg in 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.210
 the pan carefully the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.710
 sausages having made them 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.380
 jointly they have remained adhered 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.820
 to the egg and the edges we have 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.619
 trimmed very carefully with a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.670
 knife to give it this shape a bit 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.740
 more rounded flush with the sausages 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.810
 now the last step is to decorate it for 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.759
 serve it and make it more fun to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.229
 the smallest ones and for it like os 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.620
 we said at the beginning we're going to 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.570
 help from ketchup 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.570
 we can draw for example 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.030
 the twig of the flower 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.010
 and make a little leaf 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.190
 also if you want we can draw 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.190
 inside the egg 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.630
