them as far as the writing is concerned

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
them as far as the writing is concerned
I<00:01:50.220> would<00:01:50.399> say<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.060> has<00:01:51.090> its<00:01:51.630> moments<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I would say it has its moments the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499 
I would say it has its moments the
dialogue<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.070> reminds<00:01:53.520> me<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.700> adventure

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
dialogue really reminds me of adventure

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.359 
dialogue really reminds me of adventure
time<00:01:54.720> made<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.110> laugh<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
time made me laugh here and there and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.920 
time made me laugh here and there and
there's<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.579> pretty<00:01:56.820> good<00:01:56.969> one-liners<00:01:57.750> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
there's some pretty good one-liners I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.749 
there's some pretty good one-liners I
would<00:01:58.110> say<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> most<00:01:58.680> part<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.340> stories

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
would say for the most part the stories

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300 
would say for the most part the stories
go<00:01:59.969> by<00:02:00.119> quite<00:02:00.540> quickly<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.950> guess<00:02:02.130> this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
go by quite quickly and I guess this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
go by quite quickly and I guess this
would<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> good<00:02:02.880> time<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> segue<00:02:03.659> into<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
would be a good time to segue into the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.569 
would be a good time to segue into the
artwork<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.159> relates<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
artwork because I think it relates to

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.459 
artwork because I think it relates to
that<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.360> lumberjanes<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.079> panel's

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
that because in lumberjanes the panel's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.199 
that because in lumberjanes the panel's
are<00:02:07.680> quite<00:02:07.890> large<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.459> there's<00:02:08.640> only<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.090> much

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
are quite large so there's only so much

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
are quite large so there's only so much
you<00:02:09.390> could<00:02:09.569> fit<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.989> each<00:02:10.259> panel<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.979> compare

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you could fit in each panel to compare

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.610 
you could fit in each panel to compare
to<00:02:11.400> other

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
to other

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.740 
to other
titles<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.099> feel<00:02:12.340> I'm<00:02:12.580> reading<00:02:13.269> lumberjanes

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
titles I feel I'm reading lumberjanes

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.780 
titles I feel I'm reading lumberjanes
quite<00:02:14.140> quickly<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.890> what<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.099> love<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
quite quickly but what I love about the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.789 
quite quickly but what I love about the
artwork<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.390> vibrant<00:02:16.900> colors<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.560> think

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
artwork is the vibrant colors I think

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.160 
artwork is the vibrant colors I think
that's<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.280> great<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.299> really<00:02:19.780> like

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
that's really great and I really like

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.199 
that's really great and I really like
the<00:02:20.319> bold<00:02:20.590> sketchy<00:02:21.040> style<00:02:21.549> as<00:02:21.819> well<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.060> think

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
the bold sketchy style as well I think

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.050 
the bold sketchy style as well I think
it<00:02:22.510> really<00:02:22.720> lends<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.980> theme<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
it really lends to the theme and the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.750 
it really lends to the theme and the
environment<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.290> where<00:02:26.680> lumberjanes<00:02:27.370> takes

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
environment of where lumberjanes takes

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.610 
environment of where lumberjanes takes
place<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.390> think<00:02:28.629> that's<00:02:28.780> really<00:02:29.049> great<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.560> I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
place I think that's really great and I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.199
