00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.480
 hello guys today we are here with a 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.090
 new video would say pokemon and that you 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.869
 I bring the latest leaks today 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.880
 Tuesday , October 8, 2013 and well I want 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.070
 tell you that this is a spoiler so 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.689
 so for those people who do not 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.060
 want to see any new information 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.830
 so do not watch this video and for all 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.830
 the others then let's start 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.700
 the first image that we find is d 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.550
 of sexting 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.410
 how good I think it could be could be 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 false since this time shows at level 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 12 and attacks are not very much framed 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.800
 that they have since if we start from above 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 has tackings bites whips 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.790
 rolling turfs and we see that these 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.940
 they are very powerful attacks and 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.320
 also has four offensive attacks and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.720
 at level 12 I think it's pretty 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 impossible for what I think it can be 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.400
 fake because for example I found another 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.730
 another picture of sexting 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.300
 at level 6 and has 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.090
 he has the box and growl and whip stops 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.460
 and I do not think that in six levels of learning 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.820
 to bite and also unroll I see 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.290
 very unlikely but good if it's like that 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.660
 would have no problem really because it is the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.970
 that I'm going to fuck and well the more 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.970
 strong better not but hey told me 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.300
 in the description what do you think about this 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.680
 and good enough that I have found 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.740
 been the pokemon center for you to see 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.220
 that as is now how it is designed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.080
 I can see that here in the center is the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.000
 where the pokemons are cured 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.000
 because the evans seal 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.280
 also do not know if this it can be if 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 it can be like an elevator or something here 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 is the store I guess it will be that it is 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.500
 as in black and white 2 where 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.860
 we had a store and another pokemon inside 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.110
 same establishment and good up to here 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 couple of books and nothing and good what more 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.350
 brought me I was attracted the attention was this 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.610
 new design 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.670
 once cool how to be here the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.680
 pokemon and good the truth that is 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.130
 pretty cool and good we passed the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.890
 next picture that is of a lamps and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.570
 of the coach doing surfing and human 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 alliance with some photos I do not know if drama the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.810
 photographer 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.180
 but well look how cool it is 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.730
 surf in this game the truth that is 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.380
 pretty awesome I do not know what you think 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.980
 You, I think, was the truth 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.280
 that a chulada the truth look and the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.250
 graphics and everything 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.810
 and good that you have found another photo 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.360
 that I found was nothing you're with 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.040
 your four friends and they are wondering 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.890
 how do you want yourself to call you here today 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.790
 the option to choose your name your account 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.239
 like all the games but good we see 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.190
 which is a little bit different from the one 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.450
 we the teacher the teacher that you 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.930
 I asked what your name is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.170
 then it is not something different 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.630
 anecdote and good news is new 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.190
 that now ranz has become before 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.840
 it was 5 because now it's also psychic and 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.090
 Fairy as a new a new warrant 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.730
 not that I found 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 which is quite interesting for 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.720
 those who want to catch him and have 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.269
 a guy pokémon give his team since 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.840
 performs a good pokemon postman kalach 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.010
 are the good ones because good the next 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.629
 photo meeting between the deal 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.390
 experience I think many of you will already know 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.090
 but that's what I'm going to say but good 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.760
 for those who do not know in this 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.980
 game when sharing experience is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.819
 different since not only do they rise 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.640
 the points to a specific Pokémon but 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.810
 that only goes up to the whole team as 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.970
 put here this device that will leave you 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.620
 things to work with all pokémon 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.720
 of your team and receiving and these 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.920
 will receive experience points from the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.500
 screen canada therefore not all 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.750
 we would all have points of 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.930
 experience and not just one 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.889
 and well another photo that I found here is 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.520
 the one of bibi long 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.949
 and it's a new way because I admire how 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.979
 I was urging the green does not seem to be 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.180
 you do the truth so good this 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.240
 we can have seen it already in different 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.009
 colors I've seen it in blue and in others 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.169
 I do not remember very well in pink can be 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.169
 and good now we have it now in green 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.400
 well nothing was that and then later for 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.750
 end up against the two photos that 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.580
 from which we can deduce that they speak of 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.479
 broken here says the girl 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.110
 the girl is not there and I know I've heard that 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.260
 there is one that there is a TV and a 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.960
 a washing machine 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.480
 I'm going to put another photo because it's still 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.930
 the conversation here that are needed 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.570
 for the search for a new Pokémon of 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.550
 a specific Pokémon and that will refer 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.220
 to broken the only the only thing different 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.110
 is that I the arm did not know that the broken 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.020
 could have a television form not be 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.020
 of television I did not know the truth 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.900
 and good is one here and here it ends 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.100
 this video have been some small ones 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.670
 small leaks that I found 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.190
 that I found today the truth is a ratillo 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.290
 a few hours and good don tell me what 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.260

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.110
 step by step guide that I will do

 practically this week when 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.340
 contain the game and my hands and a 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.340
 greeting and see you 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.730
