00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.660
 Move to minced meat 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.039
 Is it like this 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.039
 And with the head 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.370
 What 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.039
 Change to Tochigi prefecture early 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.999
 I saw the heart of tuning 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.849
 Somehow I find it a little difficult 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.579
 Is it bad? 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.300
 Overwhelmed 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.860
 This part of the pet is 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.590
 When it happens 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.760
 I wonder if there is something wrong that is caught somewhere 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 I do not actually have a security party 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.190
 If you think that the image quality improvement 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.080
 It is a place called 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.210
 This will be a gap with the other side 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 Starting from the head 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.280
 Play example 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 The result spread 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 blitz guards 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.740
 And the spark 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.100
 What makes sense 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160
 Elevated form 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.890
 Do more teaching 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.480
 World map 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 I do not see the migrator 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.140
 The same goes for Fukuoka 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.150
 I would like to shoot by cross border 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 Around here 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 It is a map 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.830
 And now open lectures I'm not sure 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.330
 There are many 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 Masuya 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630
 This billion 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.750
 If you look at what is exhibited 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 This neighborhood has been raised Kuratatani 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 While there is a cutie 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.210
 This is relatively 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.210
 Can you say that it is a proportional candidate? 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 Other reading points 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.989
 Do you feel like 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.919
 Media denuclearization by using plain and macro lens 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.369
 It feels like this 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 The pitch is like this 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.799
 It was the location 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.139
 And 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.339
 Miyata pickup's 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:08.149
 It may be difficult to manage, but the management screen seen from the side 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:10.239
 I felt 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.239
 It is part of the root of icc 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.149
 It is ton control and volume 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.319
 As long as you have a chronic disease 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.209
 As there is no appearance of so much screw thread 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.559
 It is used that greatly remodeled management 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.019
 Without courage 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.609
 Yeah none 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.450
 Original high sky 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.439
 I wonder if it is a race 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.439
 I'll do military service but this is a bit 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.230
 The important thing is 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.919
 Is it a swollen place 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.919
 There is 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.589
 For the part going from the circuit 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.620
 How is it going to 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.119
 Let's consider 89 years 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:59.950
 I'm winning 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.439
 I 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.439
 Note 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.749
 Other 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180
 1 place 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.849
 The other 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.180
 I want to be my husband 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.809
 No bogey 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:49.169
 that 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.169
 End 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.219
 Fi 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.020
 under 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.409
 Great Britain? 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.539
 Ogawahara draft found out 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.539
 Horse worse 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.779
 I do not know the destination 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.879
 There was a discourse but the country announced 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.180
 Rebound 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.969
 Encryption 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.159
 Lotte is Ono 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.159
 Early 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.580
 Like that
