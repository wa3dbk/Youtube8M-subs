hair and then egg is known for its

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.120 
hair and then egg is known for its
protein<00:02:31.230> quantity<00:02:31.860> quality<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.790> are

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
protein quantity quality so are

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.680 
protein quantity quality so are
basically<00:02:35.130> hair<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.550> made<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.880> protein<00:02:36.360> so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
basically hair is made of protein so

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.710 
basically hair is made of protein so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
again this is a very messy process but

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.650 
again this is a very messy process but
there<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:04.100> gain<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.790> no<00:03:05.820> pain<00:03:06.300> so

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
there is no gain a there is no pain so

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.970 
there is no gain a there is no pain so
I'm<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:08.060> apply<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.209> mask<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.260> the
