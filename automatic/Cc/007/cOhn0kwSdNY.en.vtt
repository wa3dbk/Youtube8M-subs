00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
isn't going to work at this stage it's

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560 
isn't going to work at this stage it's
just<00:00:41.740> a<00:00:41.830> mock-up<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.400> show<00:00:42.610> what<00:00:43.330> it<00:00:43.420> might

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
just a mock-up to show what it might

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.750 
just a mock-up to show what it might
look<00:00:43.600> like<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.800> sort<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.070> size<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.550> it<00:00:45.670> and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
look like and the sort of size of it and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.720 
look like and the sort of size of it and
the<00:00:45.820> scale<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.090> it<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.370> just<00:00:48.400> shows<00:00:48.700> what

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
the scale of it but it just shows what

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.460 
the scale of it but it just shows what
you<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.210> do<00:00:49.450> so<00:00:49.630> quickly<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:50.050> came<00:00:50.350> up<00:00:50.440> with

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
you can do so quickly I came up with

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.350 
you can do so quickly I came up with
this<00:00:50.650> idea<00:00:50.800> two<00:00:51.160> days<00:00:51.370> ago<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.240> already

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
this idea two days ago and I already

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.440 
this idea two days ago and I already
already<00:00:52.750> have<00:00:53.020> it<00:00:53.940> looking<00:00:54.940> something<00:00:55.420> like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
already have it looking something like

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.470 
already have it looking something like
what<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.870> would<00:00:56.050> if<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.650> was<00:00:56.740> finished<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
what it would if it was finished and the

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
what it would if it was finished and the
reason<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.810> decided<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.350> do<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.740> is<00:01:00.150> because

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.390 

prosthetic<00:01:04.449> hands<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:05.619> children<00:01:06.070> they<00:01:06.220> cost

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
prosthetic hands for children they cost

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.950 
prosthetic hands for children they cost
just<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.759> same<00:01:06.969> amount<00:01:07.240> as<00:01:07.359> they<00:01:07.509> do<00:01:07.570> for<00:01:07.840> an

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
just the same amount as they do for an

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.660 
just the same amount as they do for an
adult<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:10.829> because<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:11.950> child<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.310> growing

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
adult but because the child is growing

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.940 
adult but because the child is growing
all<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.909> time<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.960> have<00:01:14.109> to<00:01:14.259> buy<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.439> new<00:01:14.770> one

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
all the time you have to buy a new one

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.219 
all the time you have to buy a new one
every<00:01:15.189> couple<00:01:15.369> of<00:01:15.700> years<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:16.630> even<00:01:17.079> more

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
every couple of years so it's even more

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.349 
every couple of years so it's even more
expensive<00:01:17.770> than<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:18.009> would<00:01:18.159> be<00:01:18.189> for<00:01:18.369> now<00:01:18.700> you

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
expensive than it would be for now you

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.109 
expensive than it would be for now you
have<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.630> spend<00:01:19.929> this<00:01:20.249> 50,000<00:01:21.249> pounds<00:01:21.609> every

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.139 
couple of years each time costing around
80,000<00:02:04.509> pounds<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.310> there's<00:02:06.670> no<00:02:06.819> way<00:02:06.999> that

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
80,000 pounds and so there's no way that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.580 
80,000 pounds and so there's no way that
they<00:02:07.270> could<00:02:07.329> possibly<00:02:07.569> afford<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.319> give<00:02:08.470> in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
they could possibly afford to give in

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.820 
they could possibly afford to give in
hands<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:09.130> well<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:10.080> I'm<00:02:11.080> hoping<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.560> with

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
hands as well and I'm hoping that with

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.039 
hands as well and I'm hoping that with
the<00:02:11.980> open<00:02:12.189> hand<00:02:12.340> project<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.569> might<00:02:13.780> change

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
the open hand project that might change

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.960 
the open hand project that might change
and<00:02:14.409> there's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.310> very<00:02:15.459> real

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and there's a very real

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.760 
and there's a very real
ability<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.900> he<00:02:17.050> could<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.320> able<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.620> have

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
ability that he could be able to have

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.020 
ability that he could be able to have
something<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:19.000> each<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.140> his<00:02:20.200> hands

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
something like this on each of his hands

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.720 
something like this on each of his hands
instead<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.300> nothing<00:02:22.960> at<00:02:23.200> all<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.520> reason

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
instead of nothing at all and the reason

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.750 
instead of nothing at all and the reason
its<00:02:24.970> stylized<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> superhero<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:27.280> because

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
its stylized like a superhero is because

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.260 
its stylized like a superhero is because
a<00:02:28.120> child<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.960> really<00:02:29.200> relate<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:30.270> kids
