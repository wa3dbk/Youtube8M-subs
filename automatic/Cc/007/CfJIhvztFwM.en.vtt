00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it's also very very remote so the only

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.879 
it's also very very remote so the only
way<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:08.789> float<00:01:09.240> plane<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.509> by<00:01:09.569> boat<00:01:09.889> in

the problem of camera shake whilst I'm
in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.209> kayak<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.319> I<00:01:34.380> can't<00:01:34.619> determine<00:01:34.859> this

in the kayak but I can't determine this

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.160 
in the kayak but I can't determine this
until<00:01:35.279> I<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.459> into<00:01:35.579> position<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.810> it's

until I get into position so it's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.510 
until I get into position so it's
anywhere<00:01:37.439> between<00:01:37.529> a<00:01:37.679> thousand<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.249> sixteen
