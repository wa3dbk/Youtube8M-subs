00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.599
 hello, I'm fede pintos and 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.599
 I dedicate my life to filming 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.380
 can be considered in a documentalist 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.710
 but exceptionally exceptional 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.300
 because they are some circumstances 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.470
 quite particular ones that make 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.970
 is 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.970
 that this may have a format 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.010
 of documentary 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.520
 It's a movie that I've been filming 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.570
 10 years and about a group of people who 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 he 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.430
 they called themselves videos ok shawn michaels 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.260
 I do not know if the word is tortuous but yes 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.320
 difficult the truth that happened of 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.449
 good in 10 years many things happen 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.770
 is looking for an algorithm a sequence 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.200
 that has a precise effect on the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 reality of the mind somehow what 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 I'm looking to hack the brain 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 ah 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 there are friends who ask me if this is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.650
 a work of art and the truth is that no 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.960
 I know 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.960
 I do not know maybe I do not know what I know
