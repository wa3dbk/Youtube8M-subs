00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.350 

this<00:00:04.390> is<00:00:04.600> week<00:00:05.340> 7<00:00:06.340> an<00:00:06.700> 8<00:00:06.940> update<00:00:08.999> and<00:00:09.999> we<00:00:10.179> do

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
this is week 7 an 8 update and we do

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.009 
this is week 7 an 8 update and we do
share<00:00:10.599> a<00:00:10.660> few<00:00:10.959> things<00:00:11.200> with<00:00:11.349> you<00:00:11.759> about

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
share a few things with you about

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.269 
share a few things with you about
maintaining<00:00:14.019> the<00:00:14.499> pH<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.920> water

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
maintaining the pH of the water

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.730 
maintaining the pH of the water
I<00:00:20.849> suffered<00:00:21.849> quite<00:00:22.720> a<00:00:22.839> few<00:00:23.109> loss<00:00:23.410> of<00:00:24.099> fish<00:00:24.490> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I suffered quite a few loss of fish and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.050 
I suffered quite a few loss of fish and
I<00:00:26.740> found<00:00:27.099> out<00:00:27.279> that<00:00:28.679> there<00:00:29.679> are<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:30.060> combination

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
I found out that there are a combination

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.910 
I found out that there are a combination
of<00:00:31.539> reasons<00:00:31.810> for<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.890> dance<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.490> fish<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:35.620> is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
of reasons for the dance of fish one is

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.330 
of reasons for the dance of fish one is
the<00:00:36.190> high<00:00:36.400> temperature<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.380> I<00:00:38.410> cannot<00:00:39.010> help

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
the high temperature so I cannot help

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.150 
the high temperature so I cannot help
too<00:00:40.060> much<00:00:40.240> about<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.840> another<00:00:41.710> thing<00:00:41.980> is

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
too much about this another thing is

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.100 
too much about this another thing is
that<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.350> water<00:00:44.530> is<00:00:44.710> too<00:00:45.100> acidic<00:00:45.720> it's<00:00:46.720> about

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
that the water is too acidic it's about

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.810 
that the water is too acidic it's about
6<00:00:47.860> in<00:00:48.730> pH<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:50.140> is<00:00:50.170> not<00:00:50.710> very<00:00:51.010> good<00:00:51.220> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
6 in pH which is not very good the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.580 
6 in pH which is not very good the
combination<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.660> heat<00:00:52.840> and<00:00:53.310> acidic<00:00:54.310> water

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
combination of the heat and acidic water

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.490 
combination of the heat and acidic water
will<00:00:56.590> cause<00:00:56.980> some<00:00:57.400> trouble<00:00:58.210> for<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.720> fish<00:00:58.930> in

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
will cause some trouble for the fish in

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.550 
will cause some trouble for the fish in
my<00:00:59.560> experience<00:01:00.340> so<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.570> is<00:01:01.720> always<00:01:02.200> wise<00:01:02.530> to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
my experience so it is always wise to

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.460 
my experience so it is always wise to
maintain<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.820> proper<00:01:04.890> pH<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.610> water

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
maintain a proper pH of the water

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340 
maintain a proper pH of the water
technology<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:09.160> my<00:01:09.370> experience<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.570> there<00:01:10.960> Sun

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
technology in my experience is there Sun

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.750 
technology in my experience is there Sun
and<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:12.490> can't<00:01:13.090> work<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:14.500> food<00:01:14.860> crops<00:01:15.460> and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
and you can't work there food crops and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.430 
and you can't work there food crops and
with<00:01:16.060> good<00:01:16.390> yield<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:18.070> this<00:01:18.340> system<00:01:19.440> but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
with good yield in this system but

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.290 
with good yield in this system but
however<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:22.170> technology<00:01:23.170> alone<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.909> not

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
however the technology alone will not

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.240 
however the technology alone will not
guarantee<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:27.100> commercial<00:01:27.820> success<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
guarantee your commercial success the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.730 
guarantee your commercial success the
commercial<00:01:30.790> success<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.540> entirely<00:01:32.409> different

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
commercial success is entirely different

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.380 
commercial success is entirely different
story<00:01:33.250> I'm<00:01:34.030> going<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:35.080> give<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.470> example<00:01:36.390> if

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
story I'm going to give you example if

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.460 
story I'm going to give you example if
you<00:01:37.630> want<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.220> continuous<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.290> a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
you want to have a continuous for the a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.140 
you want to have a continuous for the a
protein<00:01:46.020> yield<00:01:47.020> from<00:01:47.409> this<00:01:47.650> system<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:49.090> you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
protein yield from this system and you

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.990 
protein yield from this system and you
need<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:51.340> how<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:51.820> manage<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:53.170> crop

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
need to know how to manage the crop

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.420 
need to know how to manage the crop
problem<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.500> my<00:01:56.710> experience<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.590> can<00:01:59.860> divide

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
problem in my experience you can divide

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.240 
problem in my experience you can divide
all<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.210> crops<00:02:01.570> due<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.470> three<00:02:03.060> categories

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
all the crops due to three categories

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.680 
all the crops due to three categories
category<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.840> eats<00:02:07.840> those<00:02:09.179> crops<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.479> can

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
category one eats those crops you can

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.100 
category one eats those crops you can
harvest<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.380> year<00:02:11.440> round<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:12.550> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
harvest all year round like this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
harvest all year round like this
watercress<00:02:14.970> category<00:02:15.970> 2<00:02:16.270> our<00:02:17.110> plows<00:02:17.410> like

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
watercress category 2 our plows like

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.360 
watercress category 2 our plows like
Chili's<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.800> be<00:02:20.890> careful<00:02:21.340> of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
Chili's but you have to be careful of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.780 
Chili's but you have to be careful of
the<00:02:22.060> variety<00:02:22.810> all<00:02:22.990> over<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> Chili's<00:02:23.890> some<00:02:24.640> of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
the variety all over the Chili's some of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the variety all over the Chili's some of
the<00:02:25.060> variety<00:02:25.630> tend<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.440> grow<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.790> very<00:02:27.820> short

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the variety tend to grow in a very short

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.220 
the variety tend to grow in a very short
season<00:02:29.110> summer<00:02:30.070> can't<00:02:30.430> last<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:31.030> bit<00:02:31.060> longer<00:02:31.239> so

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
season summer can't last a bit longer so

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.070 
season summer can't last a bit longer so
you<00:02:32.290> need<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:33.239> figure<00:02:34.239> out<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.690> which<00:02:34.840> one<00:02:35.050> you

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
you need to figure out to which one you

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.770 
you need to figure out to which one you
select<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:36.370> have<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.730> figure<00:02:36.970> out<00:02:37.120> who<00:02:37.420> when

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
select you have to figure out who when

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.890 
select you have to figure out who when
to<00:02:38.020> replace<00:02:38.320> them<00:02:39.270> otherwise<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.570> leave<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
to replace them otherwise you leave a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.660 
to replace them otherwise you leave a
huge<00:02:41.500> gap<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:42.370> as<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.940> did<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.739> take<00:02:45.489> out

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
huge gap just as I did for I take out

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.710 
huge gap just as I did for I take out
all<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.269> beings<00:02:47.200> because<00:02:47.620> they<00:02:47.650> become<00:02:48.310> tough

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
all the beings because they become tough

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.979 
all the beings because they become tough
but<00:02:49.720> by<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.440> time<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.860> plant<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.760> take<00:02:52.510> them<00:02:52.810> out

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
but by the time I plant I take them out

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.460 
but by the time I plant I take them out
there<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.190> new<00:02:54.459> seedlings<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:56.680> too<00:02:57.430> small<00:02:57.700> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
there the new seedlings are too small to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.050 
there the new seedlings are too small to
you<00:02:59.470> know<00:02:59.590> make<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> continuous<00:03:01.650> growth<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:04.000> you

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you know make a continuous growth so you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.870 
you know make a continuous growth so you
need<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.690> figure<00:03:04.870> out<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.620> timing<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.580> very

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
need to figure out the timing it's very

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.100 
need to figure out the timing it's very
important<00:03:07.420> when<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.470> planting<00:03:09.840> season<00:03:10.840> newly

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
important when you planting season newly

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.270 
important when you planting season newly
harvested<00:03:12.540> crops<00:03:15.120> category<00:03:16.120> 3<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.650> plants
