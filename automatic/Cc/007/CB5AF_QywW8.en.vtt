hi I'm Todd ale and today we're gonna
talk<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.090> intonation<00:00:03.990> hopefully<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.920> can

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
talk about intonation hopefully I can

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.369 
talk about intonation hopefully I can
give<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> few<00:00:05.700> exercises<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.960> help<00:00:07.230> you

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
give you a few exercises that help you

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.190 
give you a few exercises that help you
play<00:00:07.589> more<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:07.919> tune<00:00:08.900> intonation<00:00:09.900> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
play more in tune intonation is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810 
play more in tune intonation is
certainly<00:00:10.469> tricky<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.340> something<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:11.790> all

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
certainly tricky it's something we all

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is string players strive to perfect just

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
is string players strive to perfect just
so<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:16.070> there<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.190> no<00:00:17.340> such<00:00:17.490> thing<00:00:17.670> as

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
first I believe to write about it so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
maybe you can take some small comfort in

maybe you can take some small comfort in

I<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:40.579> often<00:00:41.579> teachers<00:00:41.790> will<00:00:42.120> give

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
I think often teachers will give

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
I think often teachers will give
students<00:00:43.469> tapes<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.040> put<00:00:44.190> their<00:00:44.340> fingers<00:00:44.640> on

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
students tapes to put their fingers on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
students tapes to put their fingers on
and<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> fine<00:00:45.690> method<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.230> start<00:00:46.500> with

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and this is a fine method to start with

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
and this is a fine method to start with
our<00:00:47.190> goal<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> course<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> train<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> ears

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
our goal of course is to train the ears

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
our goal of course is to train the ears
to<00:00:48.960> hear<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> pitches<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.440> understand

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to hear the pitches so if you understand

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.639 
to hear the pitches so if you understand
the<00:00:53.219> way<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> string<00:00:53.760> works<00:00:54.199> if<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.410> play<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the way the string works if I play a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.750 
the way the string works if I play a
third<00:00:56.070> finger<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.760> any<00:00:57.449> string<00:00:58.460> other<00:00:59.460> than

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
third finger on any string other than

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
third finger on any string other than
the<00:00:59.940> lowest<00:01:00.449> string<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.079> book<00:01:01.260> one

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the lowest string which in book one

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
the lowest string which in book one
until<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> end<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> haven't<00:01:03.059> been

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
until the end of it you haven't been

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.250 
until the end of it you haven't been
introduced<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> any<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> third

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
introduced to any way it the third

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.880 
introduced to any way it the third
finger<00:01:07.500> matches<00:01:08.220> pitch<00:01:09.090> wise<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.619> string

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
finger matches pitch wise the string

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.100 
finger matches pitch wise the string
below<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
below it

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
below it
it's<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.260> octave<00:01:13.619> higher<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.610> two<00:01:14.939> three

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it's an octave higher so one two three

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.289 
it's an octave higher so one two three
four<00:01:15.570> five<00:01:15.840> six<00:01:16.140> seven<00:01:16.439> eight<00:01:17.060> notes<00:01:18.060> higher

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
four five six seven eight notes higher

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.320 
four five six seven eight notes higher
but<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> same<00:01:19.740> pitch<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:20.850> three

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
but it is the same pitch so if I'm three

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.440 
but it is the same pitch so if I'm three
on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> string<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.320> playing<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> D<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on the a string I'm playing a D and so I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.490 
on the a string I'm playing a D and so I
play<00:01:24.659> open<00:01:24.960> D<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.930> tell<00:01:28.080> us<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> same

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
play open D you can tell us the same

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.120 
play open D you can tell us the same
note<00:01:28.850> if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.900> capable<00:01:31.229> yet<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> flank

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
note if you are not capable yet a flank

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.230 
note if you are not capable yet a flank
two<00:01:32.310> notes<00:01:32.640> two<00:01:33.119> strings<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.930> once<00:01:34.189> like<00:01:35.240> like

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
two notes two strings at once like like

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.620 
two notes two strings at once like like
this<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> play

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
this then you can play

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.440 
this then you can play
one<00:01:41.630> at<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> time<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.729> should<00:01:43.909> work<00:01:44.119> towards

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
one at a time you should work towards

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.249 
one at a time you should work towards
two<00:01:44.780> strings<00:01:45.049> at<00:01:45.200> once<00:01:46.840> because<00:01:47.840> eventually

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
two strings at once because eventually

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.809 
two strings at once because eventually
that's<00:01:48.469> how<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.649> will<00:01:48.890> turn<00:01:49.039> your<00:01:49.130> violin<00:01:49.609> by

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
that's how you will turn your violin by

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.300 
that's how you will turn your violin by
playing<00:01:50.060> open<00:01:50.359> strings<00:01:50.740> fourth<00:01:51.740> finger<00:01:52.130> if

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
playing open strings fourth finger if

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.859 
playing open strings fourth finger if
you've<00:01:52.640> started<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.450> finger<00:01:55.299> is<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.600> same

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
you've started that finger is the same

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.520 
you've started that finger is the same
note<00:01:57.140> exactly<00:01:57.969> it's<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.179> boat<00:01:59.390> as<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.259> open

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
note exactly it's the boat as the open

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.620 
note exactly it's the boat as the open
string<00:02:00.740> above<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.849> four<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:03.700> b<00:02:04.700> c<00:02:04.969> d

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
string above it so four on the a a b c d

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.719 
string above it so four on the a a b c d
e<00:02:06.909> is<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.209> same<00:02:08.420> note<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.799> can<00:02:10.099> check<00:02:10.519> your

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
e is the same note so you can check your

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.300 
e is the same note so you can check your
force<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> i<00:02:12.410> recommend<00:02:12.860> checking<00:02:13.010> like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
force and i recommend checking like
