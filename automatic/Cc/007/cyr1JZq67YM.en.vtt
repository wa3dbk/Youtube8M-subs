fourteenth<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> moon<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.070> cancer

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
fourteenth we have the moon in cancer

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.240 
fourteenth we have the moon in cancer
today<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.510> moon<00:00:30.689> likes<00:00:31.080> being<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.560> cancer<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
today the moon likes being in cancer I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
today the moon likes being in cancer I
don't<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.700> other<00:00:33.000> people<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.840> when

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
don't think other people like it when

don't think other people like it when
when<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:35.370> our<00:00:35.910> Moon's<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.230> now

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
when when our Moon's how can that be now

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.380 
when when our Moon's how can that be now
we<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.309> moon<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> moon<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.239> in

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
we all have the moon and the moon is in

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
we all have the moon and the moon is in
cancer<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> moon<00:00:40.230> likes<00:00:40.500> being<00:00:40.860> there

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
cancer and the moon likes being there

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
cancer and the moon likes being there
but<00:00:41.430> sometimes<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.090> difficult<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.989> what

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
but sometimes it's difficult that's what

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.540 
but sometimes it's difficult that's what
I<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> say<00:00:43.620> sometimes<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.460> difficult

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I want to say sometimes it's difficult

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
I want to say sometimes it's difficult
when<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> moon<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.840> cancer<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.710> we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
when the moon is in cancer because we

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.010 
when the moon is in cancer because we
feel<00:00:47.250> things<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.969> strongly<00:00:48.420> we're<00:00:48.780> very

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
feel things very strongly we're very

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.889 
feel things very strongly we're very
sensitive<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.770> sometimes<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.789> difficult

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
sensitive and sometimes it's difficult

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
sensitive and sometimes it's difficult
to<00:00:51.899> express<00:00:52.320> those<00:00:52.620> feelings<00:00:52.680> outwardly<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to express those feelings outwardly and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
to express those feelings outwardly and
that's<00:00:54.449> underscored<00:00:55.170> today<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> several<00:00:56.100> ways

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that's underscored today in several ways

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
that's underscored today in several ways
that<00:00:56.670> moon<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.180> security<00:00:57.629> seeking<00:00:58.050> cancer

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that moon and security seeking cancer

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.849 
that moon and security seeking cancer
runs<00:00:59.340> into<00:00:59.760> tens<00:01:00.120> aspects<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.109> Uranus<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
runs into tens aspects with Uranus and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
runs into tens aspects with Uranus and
Pluto<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.489> transformational<00:01:03.480> planets

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
Pluto these transformational planets

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
Pluto these transformational planets
that<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.860> disturbing<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.850> although

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that can be disturbing all although

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
that can be disturbing all although
occasionally<00:01:06.950> exciting<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
occasionally exciting but the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
occasionally exciting but the
communication<00:01:08.939> piece<00:01:09.659> comes<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.560> verbal

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
communication piece comes from verbal

communication piece comes from verbal
mercury<00:01:11.520> square<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.990> tense<00:01:13.470> angles<00:01:14.159> with

mercury square it's tense angles with

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
mercury square it's tense angles with
the<00:01:15.060> lunar<00:01:15.450> nodes<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.049> notes<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.650> moon

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the lunar nodes the notes of the moon

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.350 
the lunar nodes the notes of the moon
have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> great<00:01:17.460> deal<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.299> we

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
have a great deal to do with how we

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
have a great deal to do with how we
connect<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.770> Mercury's<00:01:20.280> right

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
connect and I think Mercury's right

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.609 
connect and I think Mercury's right
angle<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> node<00:01:21.540> makes<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> more

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
angle to the node makes it more

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.830 
angle to the node makes it more
difficult<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.340> us<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> take<00:01:24.240> what's<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.689> our

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
difficult for us to take what's in our

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
difficult for us to take what's in our
head<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.430> mouths<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
head get it out of our mouths and have

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
head get it out of our mouths and have
it<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.390> received<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.409> sensible<00:01:28.860> form<00:01:29.280> by

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it be received in a sensible form by

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.300 
it be received in a sensible form by
someone<00:01:29.880> else<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> upshot

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
someone else so I think that the upshot

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.039 
someone else so I think that the upshot
of<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.509> feel<00:01:33.780> very

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
of this is that we can feel very

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.620 
of this is that we can feel very
strongly<00:01:34.470> our<00:01:34.920> emotions<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.909> being<00:01:35.939> rattled

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
strongly our emotions are being rattled

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
strongly our emotions are being rattled
in<00:01:36.810> many<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.320> ways<00:01:37.560> by<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
in many which ways by all the the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.539 
in many which ways by all the the
currents<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.590> relationships<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.860> social

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
currents of our relationships the social

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
currents of our relationships the social
conditions<00:01:42.090> everything<00:01:42.509> that's<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:43.020> on

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
conditions everything that's going on

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
conditions everything that's going on
but<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> connect<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.420> might<00:01:45.630> feel

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but when we go to connect we might feel

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
but when we go to connect we might feel
alienated<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.799> might<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.310> difficult<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
alienated we might it's difficult to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.179 
alienated we might it's difficult to
make<00:01:48.360> tolerance<00:01:49.049> talk<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> hand<00:01:52.189> that's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
make tolerance talk to the hand that's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.249 
make tolerance talk to the hand that's
it<00:01:53.460> though<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.000> difficult<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.869> feel<00:01:55.049> like

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it though it's difficult to feel like

it though it's difficult to feel like
