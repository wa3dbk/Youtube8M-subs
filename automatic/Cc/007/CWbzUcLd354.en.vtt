00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
my studio all the time and I'd walk

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.390 
my studio all the time and I'd walk
through<00:01:05.080> New<00:01:05.409> York<00:01:05.590> where<00:01:05.830> I<00:01:05.890> grew<00:01:06.130> up<00:01:06.159> and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
through New York where I grew up and

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
where I was living and I'd see all these

amazing<00:01:08.110> things<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.890> street<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.820> I'd

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
amazing things on the street and I'd

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.520 
amazing things on the street and I'd
opened<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.240> big<00:01:10.420> door<00:01:10.659> with<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> padlock<00:01:11.110> and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
had absolutely nothing to do with what I

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.280 
had absolutely nothing to do with what I
was<00:01:18.610> walking<00:01:18.850> through<00:01:19.060> but<00:01:19.630> was<00:01:19.810> what<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.020> did

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
was walking through but was what I did

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.109 
was walking through but was what I did
in<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.530> studio<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.399> I<00:01:21.550> realized<00:01:21.880> at<00:01:22.030> a

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
in the studio and I realized at a

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.200 
in the studio and I realized at a
certain<00:01:22.420> point<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:23.470> had<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.250> studio<00:01:24.970> life

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
certain point that I had a studio life

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.790 
certain point that I had a studio life
that<00:01:25.420> was<00:01:25.509> completely<00:01:25.990> separate<00:01:26.470> from<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
that was completely separate from the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.010 
that was completely separate from the
life<00:01:26.979> around<00:01:27.490> me<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.940> was<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.660> parts<00:01:28.929> that

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
life around me that was the parts that

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.290 
life around me that was the parts that
were<00:01:29.170> engaged<00:01:29.470> by<00:01:29.820> walking<00:01:30.820> through<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> city

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
were engaged by walking through the city

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.150 
were engaged by walking through the city
and<00:01:31.539> wandering<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.289> getting<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.979> know<00:01:33.130> people

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
and wandering and getting to know people

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.790 
and wandering and getting to know people
and<00:01:33.820> getting<00:01:34.030> lost<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.289> gave<00:01:35.470> up<00:01:35.500> my

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
and getting lost and so I gave up my

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.040 
and getting lost and so I gave up my
studio<00:01:36.070> which<00:01:36.429> I<00:01:36.580> was<00:01:36.729> think<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.119> was<00:01:37.899> either

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
studio which I was think of was either

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.930 
studio which I was think of was either
the<00:01:38.259> bravest<00:01:38.470> thing<00:01:38.920> or<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.220> stupidest<00:01:39.700> thing

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
the bravest thing or the stupidest thing

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.820 
the bravest thing or the stupidest thing
and<00:01:40.179> I<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:40.270> started<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.929> work<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> street

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
and I just started to work on the street

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.520 
and I just started to work on the street
being<00:01:42.190> responsive<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.990> whatever<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.050> came<00:01:44.380> up

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
being responsive to whatever I came up

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.109 
being responsive to whatever I came up
against<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.429> first<00:01:45.789> thing<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.060> remember

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
against and the first thing I remember

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.809 
against and the first thing I remember
doing<00:01:46.600> was<00:01:47.100> finding<00:01:48.100> myself<00:01:48.250> train<00:01:48.610> across

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
doing was finding myself train across

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.940 
doing was finding myself train across
the<00:01:48.940> street<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.869> snows<00:01:50.200> had<00:01:50.470> melted<00:01:50.830> and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
the street and the snows had melted and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.380 
the street and the snows had melted and
there<00:01:51.069> was<00:01:51.159> this<00:01:51.250> enormous<00:01:51.520> puddle<00:01:52.060> but<00:01:52.300> it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
there was this enormous puddle but it

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.969 
there was this enormous puddle but it
actually<00:01:52.509> becomes<00:01:52.869> sort<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.229> lake<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.890> I

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
actually becomes sort of a lake and I

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.469 
actually becomes sort of a lake and I
watched<00:01:54.190> people<00:01:54.429> walk<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.090> middle<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
watched people walk to the middle of the

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.330 
watched people walk to the middle of the
block<00:01:55.720> said<00:01:56.440> that<00:01:56.590> they<00:01:56.710> could<00:01:56.920> get<00:01:57.100> around

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
block said that they could get around

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.840 
block said that they could get around
the<00:01:57.490> puddle

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
the puddle

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.669

that were utilitarian they seemed to
have<00:02:06.399> an<00:02:06.640> urgency<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.420> purpose<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.830> I

have an urgency and a purpose that is I
could<00:02:09.670> make<00:02:10.030> something<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:11.500> would<00:02:11.590> affect

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
could make something that would affect

could make something that would affect
someone's<00:02:12.340> day<00:02:12.610> but<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.209> also<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:13.629> things<00:02:13.870> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
someone's day but I also do things that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.500 
someone's day but I also do things that
are<00:02:14.560> services<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.430> different<00:02:15.790> sorts<00:02:16.180> things

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
are services of different sorts things

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.059 
are services of different sorts things
that<00:02:16.750> are<00:02:16.870> more<00:02:17.410> celebratory<00:02:17.980> we<00:02:18.790> think<00:02:19.030> that

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
that are more celebratory we think that

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.199 
that are more celebratory we think that
celebration<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.220> something<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.879> we<00:02:22.030> have

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
celebration is something that we have

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.690 
celebration is something that we have
less<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.660> less<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.260> everyday<00:02:23.560> life<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:24.459> I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
less and less of in everyday life if I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.309 
less and less of in everyday life if I
can<00:02:24.879> bring<00:02:25.060> something<00:02:25.569> into<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.959> public

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319

realm<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:26.890> celebratory<00:02:27.849> then<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.510> does

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
realm that is celebratory then that does

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.890 
realm that is celebratory then that does
become<00:02:29.140> part<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.500> everyday<00:02:29.770> life<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.370> think
