00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
seems that the Arkham community has

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.660 
seems that the Arkham community has
already<00:00:54.059> cracked<00:00:54.629> those<00:00:54.840> codes<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.579> one<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
already cracked those codes and one of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.740 
already cracked those codes and one of
the<00:00:56.730> characters<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.270> got<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> see

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the characters that we got to see

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
the characters that we got to see
through<00:00:58.020> those<00:00:58.140> descriptions<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:59.309> Azrael

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
through those descriptions was Azrael

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
through those descriptions was Azrael
not<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> unlock<00:01:00.690> Azrael<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.890> entirely

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
not to unlock Azrael I'm not entirely

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
not to unlock Azrael I'm not entirely
sure<00:01:02.340> which<00:01:02.699> slot<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> code

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
sure which slot you have to put the code

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.240 
sure which slot you have to put the code
in<00:01:04.080> however<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.369> code<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.970> suit<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:07.250> Sorrows

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
in however the code is suit of Sorrows

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
in however the code is suit of Sorrows
so<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> put<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:08.970> suit<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.330> sorrows<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.720> one

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so if you put in suit of sorrows in one

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
so if you put in suit of sorrows in one
of<00:01:10.140> those<00:01:10.320> slots<00:01:10.680> inevitably<00:01:11.310> you're<00:01:11.850> gonna
