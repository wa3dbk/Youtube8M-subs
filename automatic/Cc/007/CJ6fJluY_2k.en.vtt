00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.569
 hi girls once again a star 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.360
 tutorial to understand our letter 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.390
 staff today we're going to look for the signs 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.790
 of success in your astral chart once 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.260
 you enter astro dotcom what's important 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.930
 is that once you have the letter 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.119
 opposite you understand that it is a circle of 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.029
 12 houses each house governs an area of 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.550
 our life to seek success or 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.800
 our professional vocation the most 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.890
 important is of course to know where 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.260
 is the sun the sun depends on its centuries 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.719
 and the house where it's indicated where we're going 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.190
 to shine and let's shine despite 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.829
 what we are looking for what we are 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.659
 waiting because the sun shows our 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.670
 qualities like who says mouth 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.899
 for outside like this perceives us the people thus 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.960
 we do not want 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.789
 this girl with the sun in air is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.370
 perceived as an initiator to as a 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.199
 fire star as has the sun in the house 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.239
 number 11 which is the house of the groups 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.670
 it is also the home of the hearings by 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.979
 so she can be the leader of a 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.679
 group or talk in front of big 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.830
 hearings and incite those people to 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.960
 to start a job in your life 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.180
 then we see what the ascendant is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.400
 because although the sun is the goal the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.990
 ascending is the way to get to 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.540
 that goal if there is no outside initiator 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.760
 like all the others to ibex like that with the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.920
 ascending in gemini this person is going 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.870
 to do through communication and not 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.550
 you fall into the error of thinking that the 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.650
 communication is only talk about how 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.890
 is listening to me there are many ways to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.890
 communicate the gemini signs that govern 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.230
 Mercury is everything that helps us 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.900
 take what we have inside out 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.000
 can be through photos can be to 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.070
 through the language of hands can be to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.710
 through sculpture painting any 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.300
 type of expression to know what kind of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.950
 expression is going to use this girl yo 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.440
 I have to look for who governs the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.330
 rising that is mercury and mercury 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.360
 is also engaged in house number 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.090
 11 therefore this girl can be a 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.130
 initiator to someone who inspires or who 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 Advise the group of people or the group 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.680
 of business for example to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.860
 your finances to be an ending already 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.500
 coaching these people could also 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.230
 be a women's psychologist who 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.870
 helps boost your self-esteem and could 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.250
 give workshops that is the most important thing 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.770
 after analyzing these parts 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.300
 analyze the half sky the most part 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.130
 high of the letter or when you 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.200
 listen or read in a horoscope that I say 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.350
 the top of your letter I mean this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.050
 zone that is here lbs the middle heaven is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.020
 our public part our area of 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.030
 success or clear personal improvement 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.520
 success depends on what it means for 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.770
 you maybe for maybe for my success it's 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.140
 get married and maybe for you success is to be 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.420
 manager of a successful company in a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.560
 too personal term especially in 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.620
 these times 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.380
 then lbs will tell me what is your 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.810
 idea of â€‹â€‹success and how are you going to do 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.480
 finally perceived apart from your alone 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.660
 how to make that climb to the top 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.730
 this girl as she has in the mc to the sign 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.050
 Pisces tells me that she will use 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.900
 subtle methods of inspiration for 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.140
 with other people also with pisces in 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.810
 the ascending with the ms is very possible 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.850
 that she is not seen clearly 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.430
 people who have pisces in the middle 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.310
 sky may have situations of fraud 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.380
 or in which they are blamed for copying to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.690
 someone else because phishing dissolves the 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.280
 ego and this kind of people believe that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.260
 that idea is yours but maybe you were inspired 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.790
 on the other hand and do not remember remember 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.980
 that pisces is the sign one of the signs 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.470
 more dispersed and it is not so much 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660
 thinking how in the competition that is 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.810
 another thing that as piscis lacks ego 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.930
 this person can lose the drive to 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.220
 grow to compete already in that case 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.870
 we would have to observe where it is at 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.970
 Mars but we will not extend until 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.340
 there something else that we should take in 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.320
 account is that in the middle heaven the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.410
 planet that is taller than him is a 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.030
 planet a satellite is the moon indicates me 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.790
 again that she's going to be seen as 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.400
 a mother and especially as we are 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.740
 talking about having mercury regent 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.450
 of the ascendant in Taurus in the house 11 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.130
 that was when I told them about women's 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.010
 empowerment to reinforce self-esteem 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.720
 it would be an excellent therapist 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.940
 start attending to people from one to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.950
 one and then start giving workshops that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.450
 they cover larger audiences because the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.700
 sun ends at house number 11 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.710
 so I hope you can use me a little 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.120
 guide the steps are easy if you do not 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.430
 they want to roll up a lot they use 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.410
 only the sun of the sun pass in the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.630
 ascendant in my astral have drawings 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.460
 that explain what each house means 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 and they also have a section that 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.350
 call star 101 where you will understand that 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.780
 means the sun in every century 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.400
 if you like this explanation write 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.590
 the so back urban and I can do 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.960
 a weekly session of this video of this 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.050
 type of videos to advise them to look for 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.600
 your vocation your profession and your purpose 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.780
 in the natal chart they have excellent 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.780
 day
