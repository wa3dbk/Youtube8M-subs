00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.420 
I thought would probably get a low grade
but<00:04:52.900> actually<00:04:53.229> pulled<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.530> nine<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.070> there's

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
but actually pulled a nine and there's

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.100 
but actually pulled a nine and there's
actually<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.820> refraction<00:04:55.360> line<00:04:55.750> straight

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
actually a refraction line straight

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.140 
actually a refraction line straight
across<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.250> had<00:04:57.400> talked<00:04:57.610> about<00:04:57.729> where<00:04:58.060> the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
across that I had talked about where the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.750 
across that I had talked about where the
fracture<00:04:58.479> lines<00:04:58.840> didn't<00:04:59.200> line<00:04:59.500> up<00:04:59.580> well<00:05:00.580> they

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
fracture lines didn't line up well they

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.980 
fracture lines didn't line up well they
must<00:05:00.970> have<00:05:01.090> looked<00:05:01.270> close<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.780> saw<00:05:01.930> it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
must have looked close and saw it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.750 
must have looked close and saw it
because<00:05:02.200> they<00:05:02.440> still<00:05:02.710> gave<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.070> nine<00:05:03.280> so

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
because they still gave it a nine so

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.950 
because they still gave it a nine so
this<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:04.030> pretty<00:05:04.180> sweet-looking<00:05:04.540> card

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
this is a pretty sweet-looking card

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.770 
this is a pretty sweet-looking card
number<00:05:05.260> 2<00:05:05.350> 199<00:05:06.240> definitely<00:05:07.240> look<00:05:07.510> good<00:05:07.660> with

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
number 2 199 definitely look good with

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.770 
number 2 199 definitely look good with
the<00:05:07.870> other<00:05:07.960> cards<00:05:08.289> I<00:05:08.350> have<00:05:08.500> then<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.130> final
