00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.120 

in<00:00:12.540> order<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.080> forks<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.559> accommodate

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
in order for the forks to accommodate

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.330 
in order for the forks to accommodate
the<00:00:14.580> width<00:00:15.090> of<00:00:15.300> the<00:00:15.389> wheel<00:00:16.070> they're<00:00:17.070> going<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the width of the wheel they're going to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.310 
the width of the wheel they're going to
need<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.700> four<00:00:18.000> inches<00:00:18.210> apart<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.200> we'll

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
need to be four inches apart so we'll

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.769 
need to be four inches apart so we'll
make<00:00:19.470> sure<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> forks<00:00:20.310> are<00:00:20.570> four<00:00:21.570> inches

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
make sure that the forks are four inches

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:45.780 
make sure that the forks are four inches
apart<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> inside

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.010 

so<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.910> fork<00:00:47.150> assembly<00:00:47.630> will<00:00:47.750> go<00:00:47.870> together

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
so the fork assembly will go together

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
so the fork assembly will go together
something<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.680> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.720 

go<00:00:58.300> ahead<00:00:58.540> and<00:00:58.690> drill<00:00:59.020> holes<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.740> the<00:01:00.100> places

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
go ahead and drill holes in the places

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.110 
go ahead and drill holes in the places
where<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.870> forks<00:01:02.500> are<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.800> hinge<00:01:03.160> it'll<00:01:04.000> be<00:01:04.090> a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
where the forks are to hinge it'll be a

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.030 
where the forks are to hinge it'll be a
lot<00:01:04.270> easier<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.629> do<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.900> now<00:01:05.140> than<00:01:05.410> later<00:01:05.470> once

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
lot easier to do it now than later once

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:41.740 
lot easier to do it now than later once
the<00:01:06.220> pieces<00:01:06.400> were<00:01:06.640> welded<00:01:06.970> together

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.999 

now<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.930> we've<00:01:43.080> got<00:01:43.320> most<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> major

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now that we've got most of the major

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
now that we've got most of the major
components<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:44.820> together<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.479> front

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
components put together for the front

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.870 
components put together for the front
fork<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.799> holes<00:01:47.009> drilled<00:01:47.280> we'll<00:01:47.729> go

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
fork and the holes drilled we'll go

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.770 
fork and the holes drilled we'll go
ahead<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> weld<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:50.240> you've<00:01:51.240> almost<00:01:51.420> got

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
ahead and weld it up you've almost got

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.930 
ahead and weld it up you've almost got
the<00:01:51.930> front<00:01:52.140> forks<00:01:54.380> holes<00:01:55.380> drilled<00:01:56.220> for<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the front forks holes drilled for the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.609 
the front forks holes drilled for the
wheels<00:01:57.710> holes<00:01:58.710> drilled<00:01:59.149> for<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.210> tourney<00:02:00.619> all

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
wheels holes drilled for the tourney all

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.529 
wheels holes drilled for the tourney all
the<00:02:01.799> well<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.220> pretty<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.580> done<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
the well it's pretty much done and

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.889 
the well it's pretty much done and
cleaned<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.670> now<00:02:05.670> we'll<00:02:05.970> do<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.119> handlebars

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
cleaned up now we'll do the handlebars

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.290 
cleaned up now we'll do the handlebars
with<00:02:07.080> this<00:02:07.289> half<00:02:07.560> inch<00:02:07.799> black<00:02:08.640> pipe<00:02:11.120> okay<00:02:12.120> I'll

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
with this half inch black pipe okay I'll

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.590 
with this half inch black pipe okay I'll
cut<00:02:12.569> my<00:02:12.720> 36<00:02:13.290> inch<00:02:13.530> long<00:02:13.800> black<00:02:14.550> pipe<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.269> half

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
cut my 36 inch long black pipe in half

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.410 
cut my 36 inch long black pipe in half
now<00:02:16.410> I'll<00:02:17.069> put<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> bend<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> pipe

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
now I'll put a bend in it with the pipe

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.350 
now I'll put a bend in it with the pipe
bender<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.440> get<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> right<00:02:20.340> curve<00:02:20.700> for

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
bender to get it to the right curve for

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.509 
bender to get it to the right curve for
the<00:02:21.420> handlebars<00:02:24.530> put<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> mark<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:25.950> both<00:02:26.190> pipes

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
the handlebars put a mark on both pipes

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.759 
the handlebars put a mark on both pipes
so<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.810> put<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> bin<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> same

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
so that I can put the bin in the same

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.449 
so that I can put the bin in the same
place

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
place

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.600 
place
put<00:02:30.150> them<00:02:30.269> are<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:31.049> my<00:02:31.500> diet<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.459> can

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
put them are on my diet so that I can

00:02:32.610 --> 00:03:31.430 
put them are on my diet so that I can
line<00:02:32.819> them<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.720> will<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:33.989> our<00:02:34.019> begin

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.140 

got<00:03:32.440> both<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.830> handlebars<00:03:33.340> bent<00:03:33.700> and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
got both of the handlebars bent and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.819 
got both of the handlebars bent and
check<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.930> make<00:03:35.049> sure<00:03:35.110> that<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.470> bends<00:03:35.709> are

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
check to make sure that the bends are

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.270 
check to make sure that the bends are
the<00:03:35.950> same<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:38.230> we're<00:03:38.440> ready<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.769> clean<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.160> the

the same now we're ready to clean up the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:04:39.090 
the same now we're ready to clean up the
ends<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.120> weld<00:03:40.329> them<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.810> forks

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.630 

I<00:04:43.110> will<00:04:44.110> take<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.440> grinder<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.040> clean<00:04:45.250> up<00:04:45.460> the
