certainly<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.830> tease<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.940> if

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
certainly a tease like we don't know if

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
certainly a tease like we don't know if
this<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.930> bad<00:00:34.410> guy<00:00:34.649> group

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this is going to be a bad guy group

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.380

although<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.399> certainly<00:00:35.520> seems<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
although it certainly seems like it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
although it certainly seems like it
based<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:36.989> he<00:00:37.050> spoke<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.550> only<00:00:38.820> real

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
based on how he spoke so the only real

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
based on how he spoke so the only real
thing<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> ask<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:39.960> immediate

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
why not these guys are doing nothing

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.830 
why not these guys are doing nothing
might<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.820> well<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.180> them<00:00:54.270> together<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
might as well put them together and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.799 
might as well put them together and
hopefully<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.800> momentum<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.210> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
hopefully they get momentum so we so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.160 
hopefully they get momentum so we so
assuming<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.829> Big<00:00:59.280> E<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> Kofi<00:00:59.960> who<00:01:00.960> else

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
assuming we have Big E and Kofi who else

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
assuming we have Big E and Kofi who else
do<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.980> gonna<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> nation

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
do you think is gonna be in the nation

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.539 
do you think is gonna be in the nation
that<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.930> question<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.739> some

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that is a good question I think some

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
that is a good question I think some
other<00:01:05.729> potentials<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.260> we

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
other potentials because what I think we

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
other potentials because what I think we
saw<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:08.010> Raw<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.640> sort<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.630> planting<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
saw on Raw was sort of planting the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
saw on Raw was sort of planting the
seeds<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.760> gonna

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
seeds and I don't think it's just gonna

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.200 
seeds and I don't think it's just gonna
be<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> three-man<00:01:12.659> group<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:14.850> looks

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
be a three-man group so right now looks

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
be a three-man group so right now looks
like<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.509> Xavier<00:01:16.049> woods<00:01:16.290> Kofi<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.040> Big<00:01:17.070> E

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
like it's Xavier woods Kofi and Big E

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
like it's Xavier woods Kofi and Big E
but<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.750> other<00:01:18.930> potentials<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but I think some other potentials are

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
but I think some other potentials are
definitely<00:01:20.100> titus<00:01:20.580> o'neil<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
definitely titus o'neil not is the one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.490 
definitely titus o'neil not is the one
maybe<00:01:22.409> maybe<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.400> diva<00:01:23.759> maybe<00:01:24.170> Cameron<00:01:25.170> Alicia

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
maybe maybe a diva maybe Cameron Alicia

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.420 
maybe maybe a diva maybe Cameron Alicia
Fox<00:01:26.150> Naomi<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.810> potential<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.280> also

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Fox Naomi have potential and I also

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.620 
Fox Naomi have potential and I also
don't<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.790> don't<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.150> they're<00:01:30.240> gonna<00:01:30.360> call

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
don't I don't know if they're gonna call

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.969 
don't I don't know if they're gonna call
it<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> nation<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> hope<00:01:31.829> they

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it the nation and I kind of hope they

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.390 
it the nation and I kind of hope they
don't<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:33.380> what<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.950> Xavier

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
don't but what do you think of Xavier

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.740 
don't but what do you think of Xavier
woods<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> role<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.990> being<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
woods in this role and not being so

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
woods in this role and not being so
unless<00:01:39.750> he's<00:01:39.990> taking<00:01:40.320> less<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.590> his<00:01:40.710> fun<00:01:40.979> side

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
unless he's taking less of his fun side

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
unless he's taking less of his fun side
and<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:42.390> maybe<00:01:42.780> ramping<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.439> his

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and and actually maybe ramping up his

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.480 
and and actually maybe ramping up his
education<00:01:44.610> side<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:45.960> serious<00:01:46.500> side<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
education side and more serious side I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.340 
education side and more serious side I
think<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.149> interesting<00:01:48.390> however<00:01:48.990> I

you<00:02:28.709> know<00:02:28.829> into<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.220> top<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.700> don't<00:02:29.879> think<00:02:30.180> so

and I think that this gives us a really
good<00:02:32.970> opportunity<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.689> sort<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.439> see

was<00:03:29.340> involved<00:03:29.699> in<00:03:29.909> nation<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.389> Mark<00:03:30.690> Henry<00:03:31.139> but

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
was involved in nation is Mark Henry but

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.759 
was involved in nation is Mark Henry but
I<00:03:31.889> feel<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:32.519> Henry<00:03:33.269> would<00:03:34.169> just<00:03:34.470> kind<00:03:34.680> of

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
I feel like Henry would just kind of

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.640 
I feel like Henry would just kind of
outshine<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.730> group<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.440> much<00:03:37.590> better

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
outshine the group I like it much better

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.599 
outshine the group I like it much better
if<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.489> young<00:03:38.699> new<00:03:39.000> talent<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.680> I

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
if it's a lot of young new talent and I

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.039 
if it's a lot of young new talent and I
feel<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.359> Henry<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.579> he's<00:03:44.579> too

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
feel like Henry is just he's too

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.539 
feel like Henry is just he's too
high-profile<00:03:46.049> for<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.190> way<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.519> I

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
high-profile for this and the way that I

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.039 
high-profile for this and the way that I
feel<00:03:47.729> like<00:03:47.849> he<00:03:47.970> would<00:03:48.150> kind<00:03:48.329> of<00:03:48.449> take<00:03:48.659> away<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
feel like he would kind of take away the

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.319 
feel like he would kind of take away the
spotlight<00:03:49.859> but<00:03:50.250> maybe<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.729> would<00:03:50.849> be<00:03:50.909> good<00:03:51.060> to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
spotlight but maybe it would be good to

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.869 
spotlight but maybe it would be good to
have<00:03:51.449> a<00:03:51.510> veteran<00:03:52.169> in<00:03:52.409> there<00:03:53.069> so<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> don't<00:03:53.760> know

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
have a veteran in there so I don't know

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.520 
have a veteran in there so I don't know
how<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.060> guys<00:03:54.209> feel<00:03:54.269> about<00:03:54.479> that<00:03:54.690> actually<00:03:55.440> do

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
how you guys feel about that actually do

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.080 
how you guys feel about that actually do
you<00:03:55.590> think<00:03:55.650> having<00:03:56.069> Mark<00:03:56.459> Henry<00:03:56.819> would<00:03:56.970> be

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
you think having Mark Henry would be

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.879 
you think having Mark Henry would be
interesting<00:03:57.810> maybe<00:03:57.959> at<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.290> beginning<00:03:58.379> and

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
interesting maybe at the beginning and

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.009 
interesting maybe at the beginning and
they<00:03:59.040> even<00:03:59.159> maybe<00:03:59.430> turn<00:03:59.819> on<00:04:00.000> him<00:04:00.209> because<00:04:00.989> I

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
they even maybe turn on him because I

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.349 
they even maybe turn on him because I
think<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.739> bully<00:04:02.310> ray<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.579> always<00:04:02.940> bring<00:04:03.180> up

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
think that a bully ray I always bring up

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.509 
think that a bully ray I always bring up
this<00:04:03.510> shoot<00:04:03.959> interview<00:04:04.379> he<00:04:04.889> says<00:04:05.159> to<00:04:05.340> put

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
this shoot interview he says to put

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.640 
this shoot interview he says to put
talent<00:04:05.970> over<00:04:06.299> they<00:04:06.690> got<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.930> go<00:04:07.109> over<00:04:07.290> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
talent over they got to go over the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.830 
talent over they got to go over the
veterans<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.299> maybe<00:04:09.510> they

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
veterans so I think that maybe they

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.080 
veterans so I think that maybe they
should<00:04:10.049> actually<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.739> completely<00:04:11.579> make

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
should actually like completely make

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.939 
should actually like completely make
reference<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.659> the<00:04:12.870> old<00:04:13.260> nation<00:04:13.829> of

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
reference to the old nation of

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.129 
reference to the old nation of
domination<00:04:14.209> even<00:04:15.209> talking<00:04:15.569> about<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> fact

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
domination even talking about the fact

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.469 
domination even talking about the fact
that<00:04:16.229> you<00:04:16.470> know<00:04:16.590> after<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.430> nation<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.299> rock

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
that you know after the nation the rock

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.149 
that you know after the nation the rock
became<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.900> success<00:04:19.409> so<00:04:19.560> they<00:04:19.680> want<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.979> follow

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
became a success so they want to follow

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.279 
became a success so they want to follow
that<00:04:20.370> same<00:04:20.579> path<00:04:20.849> they<00:04:21.060> could<00:04:21.209> go<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:22.109> many

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
that same path they could go so many

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.659 
that same path they could go so many
routes<00:04:22.590> with<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.219> nation<00:04:23.550> of

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
routes with what the nation of

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.390 
routes with what the nation of
domination<00:04:23.789> did<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:24.960> that's<00:04:25.169> why<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.409> recruit

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
domination did so that's why the recruit

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.230 
domination did so that's why the recruit
Henry<00:04:26.940> who<00:04:27.479> can<00:04:28.229> be<00:04:28.680> hated<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.669> loved<00:04:30.030> in

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
Henry who can be hated and then loved in

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.030 
Henry who can be hated and then loved in
the<00:04:30.360> same<00:04:30.600> segment<00:04:30.900> as<00:04:31.259> we've<00:04:31.590> seen<00:04:31.800> in<00:04:31.979> the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
the same segment as we've seen in the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.460 
the same segment as we've seen in the
past<00:04:32.250> because<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.000> what<00:04:33.210> he<00:04:33.300> does<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.110> imagine

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
past because of what he does so imagine

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.740 
past because of what he does so imagine
they<00:04:34.560> recruit<00:04:35.009> him<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.580> instead<00:04:36.389> of<00:04:36.509> him<00:04:36.630> and

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
they recruit him and instead of him and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.810 
they recruit him and instead of him and
he's<00:04:37.169> sort<00:04:37.440> of<00:04:37.500> like<00:04:37.620> an<00:04:37.770> advisor<00:04:38.100> but<00:04:38.669> then

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
he's sort of like an advisor but then

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.090 
he's sort of like an advisor but then
they<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.150> turn<00:04:39.449> on<00:04:39.600> him<00:04:39.810> getting<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.770> heat

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
they just turn on him getting that heat

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.340 
they just turn on him getting that heat
and<00:04:41.280> then<00:04:41.580> maybe<00:04:41.759> we<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.210> have<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:43.320> a

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
and then maybe we can have like a like a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.350 
and then maybe we can have like a like a
new<00:04:43.620> breed<00:04:44.009> type<00:04:44.310> thing<00:04:44.580> like<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:45.210> know

scenario<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.849> mean<00:05:17.849> I<00:05:17.880> do<00:05:18.000> like<00:05:18.360> what<00:05:18.570> one

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
scenario I mean I do like what one

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.930 
scenario I mean I do like what one
pointed<00:05:19.169> out<00:05:19.289> but<00:05:19.440> maybe<00:05:19.710> teasing<00:05:20.699> that<00:05:20.729> he's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
pointed out but maybe teasing that he's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.909 
pointed out but maybe teasing that he's
going<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.210> join<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.810> then<00:05:21.870> using<00:05:22.500> him<00:05:22.710> to

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
going to join and then using him to

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.210 
going to join and then using him to
actually<00:05:23.099> get<00:05:23.520> heat<00:05:24.199> but<00:05:25.199> I<00:05:25.229> think<00:05:25.770> we<00:05:25.919> can<00:05:26.070> all

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
actually get heat but I think we can all

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.219 
actually get heat but I think we can all
agree<00:05:26.370> either<00:05:26.789> way<00:05:27.030> if<00:05:27.300> they<00:05:27.509> are<00:05:27.720> going<00:05:28.110> to

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
agree either way if they are going to

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.290 
agree either way if they are going to
call<00:05:28.440> this<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.680> nation<00:05:29.099> of<00:05:29.220> domination<00:05:29.370> then

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
call this a nation of domination then

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.529 
call this a nation of domination then

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.629 
totally what this new group could be and
that's<00:07:04.449> what<00:07:04.810> I<00:07:04.870> see<00:07:05.139> it<00:07:05.259> as<00:07:05.439> yeah<00:07:06.219> so<00:07:06.430> maybe

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
that's what I see it as yeah so maybe

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.670 
that's what I see it as yeah so maybe
we'll<00:07:06.879> see<00:07:07.090> new<00:07:07.509> people<00:07:07.689> be<00:07:07.960> recruited<00:07:08.469> but<00:07:08.650> I

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 
we'll see new people be recruited but I

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.709 
we'll see new people be recruited but I
think<00:07:08.979> that<00:07:09.129> these<00:07:09.340> are<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.639> three<00:07:10.360> primary

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:10.719 
think that these are the three primary

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:12.570 
think that these are the three primary
guys<00:07:11.199> and<00:07:11.530> I<00:07:11.889> think<00:07:12.069> it's<00:07:12.190> a<00:07:12.250> very<00:07:12.400> nice

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
guys and I think it's a very nice

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.520 
guys and I think it's a very nice
balance<00:07:12.849> because<00:07:13.389> with<00:07:13.539> Kofi<00:07:13.719> you<00:07:14.349> know<00:07:14.469> you

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
balance because with Kofi you know you

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.709 
balance because with Kofi you know you
get<00:07:14.830> a<00:07:14.860> guy<00:07:15.099> that's<00:07:15.129> been<00:07:15.460> in<00:07:15.639> w/e<00:07:16.210> for<00:07:16.449> years

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:16.719 
get a guy that's been in w/e for years

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.020 
get a guy that's been in w/e for years
has<00:07:17.259> almost<00:07:17.830> been<00:07:18.129> up<00:07:18.310> there<00:07:18.520> you<00:07:18.759> know<00:07:18.789> when

he took on guys like Randy Orton and

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.279 
he took on guys like Randy Orton and
Bakey<00:07:21.520> who<00:07:21.819> spend<00:07:22.180> both<00:07:22.389> good<00:07:22.750> guy<00:07:22.960> and<00:07:23.080> bad

guy nothing's really worked and then you

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.839 
guy nothing's really worked and then you
have<00:07:25.539> the<00:07:25.930> the<00:07:26.349> new<00:07:26.560> up-and-comer<00:07:27.159> that<00:07:27.669> maybe

he's<00:07:28.060> like<00:07:28.180> the<00:07:28.300> know-it-all<00:07:28.479> like<00:07:28.990> he<00:07:29.199> has

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
he's like the know-it-all like he has

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.680 
he's like the know-it-all like he has
the<00:07:29.530> solution<00:07:29.710> and<00:07:30.219> he<00:07:30.550> has<00:07:30.669> the<00:07:30.879> PhD<00:07:31.360> to<00:07:31.539> back

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
the solution and he has the PhD to back

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.230 
the solution and he has the PhD to back
it<00:07:31.870> up<00:07:31.990> yeah<00:07:32.919> I<00:07:32.949> mean<00:07:33.129> interestingly<00:07:33.729> enough

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 
it up yeah I mean interestingly enough

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.119 
it up yeah I mean interestingly enough
if<00:07:34.539> it<00:07:34.870> is<00:07:34.990> just<00:07:35.229> the<00:07:35.319> three<00:07:35.529> of<00:07:35.650> them<00:07:35.770> I<00:07:35.949> mean

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:36.129 
if it is just the three of them I mean

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:38.640 
if it is just the three of them I mean
it<00:07:36.250> does<00:07:36.460> work<00:07:36.669> because<00:07:36.879> Kofi<00:07:37.509> is<00:07:37.750> actually

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650 
it does work because Kofi is actually

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.950 
it does work because Kofi is actually
the<00:07:38.770> veteran<00:07:39.159> here<00:07:39.490> Xavier<00:07:40.150> woods<00:07:40.599> is<00:07:40.810> the

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 
the veteran here Xavier woods is the

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.320 
the veteran here Xavier woods is the
good<00:07:41.139> mouthpiece<00:07:41.800> and<00:07:42.099> then<00:07:42.610> you<00:07:42.729> got<00:07:42.909> biggie

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330 
good mouthpiece and then you got biggie

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.119 
good mouthpiece and then you got biggie
as<00:07:43.479> the<00:07:43.659> muscle<00:07:44.080> so<00:07:44.259> you<00:07:44.319> do<00:07:44.560> have<00:07:44.740> a<00:07:44.800> really

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:45.129 
as the muscle so you do have a really

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:47.939 
as the muscle so you do have a really
good<00:07:45.779> trifecta<00:07:46.779> so<00:07:47.050> even<00:07:47.349> if<00:07:47.469> it<00:07:47.560> is<00:07:47.680> just

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:47.949 
good trifecta so even if it is just

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.619 
good trifecta so even if it is just
these<00:07:48.099> three<00:07:48.460> I<00:07:48.669> like<00:07:48.940> it

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:49.629 
these three I like it

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.170 
these three I like it
exactly<00:07:50.440> so<00:07:50.650> slowly<00:07:51.009> but<00:07:51.250> surely<00:07:51.279> I<00:07:51.699> just

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.180 
exactly so slowly but surely I just

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.360 
exactly so slowly but surely I just
really<00:07:52.509> hope<00:07:52.690> that<00:07:52.719> whatever<00:07:53.620> it<00:07:53.889> is<00:07:54.009> they<00:07:54.159> do

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.370 
really hope that whatever it is they do

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.969 
really hope that whatever it is they do
please<00:07:55.000> don't<00:07:55.360> three<00:07:55.690> and<00:07:55.839> be<00:07:55.960> it<00:07:56.080> up<00:07:56.259> I<00:07:56.409> beg
