hole<00:02:12.870> drove<00:02:13.860> through<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.360> could<00:02:15.420> put

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
hole drove through it so I could put

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.170 
hole drove through it so I could put
some<00:02:15.780> cordage<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.950> strap<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.000> my

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
hand you see though the blade very

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.220 
hand you see though the blade very
effective<00:02:25.400> very<00:02:26.400> effective<00:02:26.880> blade<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.990> no

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
doubt that if i needed to i could

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.570 
doubt that if i needed to i could
probably<00:02:38.130> chop<00:02:38.520> right<00:02:38.910> through<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:40.580> let's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
probably chop right through that let's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.790 
probably chop right through that let's
get<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> look<00:02:42.000> at<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.300> cross-section<00:02:43.290> how

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
get a look at this cross-section how

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.840 
get a look at this cross-section how
deep<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.190> bad<00:02:44.610> boys<00:02:44.880> been<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.610> few

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
deep that bad boys been just a few

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.890 
deep that bad boys been just a few
strokes<00:02:49.220> look<00:02:50.220> at<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:51.830> this<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.010> dried

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
strokes look at that this is dried

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:14.839 
strokes look at that this is dried
hardened<00:02:54.900> would<00:02:55.310> not<00:02:56.310> soft

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:24.809 

that<00:03:17.459> that's<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.610> knife<00:03:23.459> another<00:03:24.459> question

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
that that's a knife another question

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.490 
that that's a knife another question
probably<00:03:25.000> having<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.480> why<00:03:25.630> aren't<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.110> wearing

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.430 
probably having is why aren't I wearing
gloves<00:03:27.660> reason<00:03:28.660> being<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.959> because<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.380> is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
gloves reason being this because this is

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.250 
gloves reason being this because this is
so<00:03:29.739> smooth<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.489> want<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.209> feel<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.600> if<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.959> slips

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
it a little bit tighter sometimes when

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.360
