00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.690
 aal-ole to a new video 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.690
 Today I always show their light weight 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.089
 the ard-film «Stilles 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.239
 that I'm not always the honored Milans boss of a foot 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.560
 but just quite chilled clock can run 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.960
 and is she then her everything looks like you can assume that he has a high 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.909
 Ball run 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.839
 However, I just talked Bayern Munich 1 2 TSI pigs 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.800
 Dogs are running 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.410
 yes this is a much simpler way to go as it was 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.810
 admonitory 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.450
 under that he had to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.040
 - should 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 Bashir 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.550
 around here we hold this then 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.040
 whole looks shows now 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.390
 That's why we put sea in me we're looking for 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 a goal that happens to be here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.580
 now it mostly hails +1 civilians 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.630
 we do it twice each 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 it's quite important to be okay by the barely one 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 and then we just make him two deep 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.000
 which of course already wild and is the EM prepared 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.580
 snower 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.490
 looks like this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.090
 then we can actually our earth 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.140
 Research on the 7 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.970
 Walsum he always 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.650
 Of course that does not mean that 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 of nice day 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.410
 Zurich Maag Bocholt Co 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 Rare 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 where and 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.870
 the camouflage is named for it 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.600
 as if the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.650
 he falls 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.329
 Of course we will come here one more way 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.029
 does not do that snipes' 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.259
 Langner pesterly means that 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.999
 she wants more now 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.219
 Soost Ulrich 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.519
 you can of course still here 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.519
 Ulrike Merten 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.299
 and 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.209
 then a finished must 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.629
 CITES 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.449
 About like this 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.469
 Of course there should be a bit more numbers 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.989
 what percent 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.309
 Rollo Michels 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.789
 and me 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.789
 Jerez Braun we just everything here 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.189
 so to speak 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.189
 Of course, then too 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.459
 the water again 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.729
 Hilmar Leah Delos 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:02.540
 Peter 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.149
 Stenzel 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:06.389
 3 likes 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.539
 do 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.539
 yes TuS Wagenfeld 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.269

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.979
 sda 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 which one of course is still in the middle 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.929
 Tenant TuS also not so hard 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.929
 which comes to mind Schulz I'm only slightly into the stuff 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.919
 okay one comes then it was hard the Tanner 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.919
 Do not be surprised 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 the sixth 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.769
 then as normal 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.509
 which is logical 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.289
 we are already 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.239
 do not quote 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 so use Mücke Rausch as well 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.279
 elsewhere 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.389
 Of course you have to go to Danzer and Cooper 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.389
 min 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:08.099
 Prince Comedy Animal Worlds pro make a new ban on lying in Poland 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.439
 exactly 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.439
 make some cool sound 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.430
 Be a point 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.870
 that is different now 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 probably not 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.759
 Of course you are your little one 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.759
 Cereal Peltner 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.319
 I also say Isfort again 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.289
 I have nothing more to say 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.610
 Perthes citizens quickly tangible Dessau 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.129
 End quote to Sun Borst 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.129
 we should go ahead and do it 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.960
 sometimes that's not unbelievable 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.400
 therefore 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.639
 time 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.199
 was worried 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.199
 Hermann Scherchen, for example, in Kosovo want 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.040
 what am I saying now? 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.449
 Schulz and 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.050
