00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.370
 at the same time that it renewed soninha 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.410
 vehicle world 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 chevrolet decided to re-bet on 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.509
 in the SUVs 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 large companies in 2013 presented to the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.789
 to the glaser 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.920
 today I'm going to test the 2014 version of this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.160
 great sporting event this great 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 chevrolet car that in this case has a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 new turbocharged 2.8 turbo was recalibrated 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.779
 is to improve technical actions that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.719
 especially improved performance 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.250
 between the changes a new collector of 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.600
 admission to the piston injection system 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.780
 have redesigned that the new 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
 gas recirculation everything like I said 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.430
 to make the trail blazers 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.039
 perform even better and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.440
 even greater fuel economy 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.420
 talking with andré spolidoro grande 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.410
 friend andré jardine vehicles the leader of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 workshop 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.210
 he explained to me about these changes and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 said that the intake manifold in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 this new collector has 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 smooth surfaces that cause less 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.990
 adhesion and more efficiency 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.020
 this same collector also had the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.350
 improved modified geometry 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.350
 and the airflow has been optimized more 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.350
 power more performance and less consumption 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 in a brief comparison you can say that 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.790
 the two main competitors of the trail 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.790
 blazers have between 20 and 30 horses a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.470
 less power and a touch stress is 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.340
 That's why when we take a deep breath 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.280
 on the accelerator it is only she responds a lot 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.149
 strong responds right on time and at the same time 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.040
 time 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.380
 All this time I have cars. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.979
 They will do six days now I have 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.890
 delivery tomorrow for all this time 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.940
 average consumption is between nine and a half 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 and 13 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.670
 I went to the pavement on the road she did 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.630
 12.9 per liter a portion of 120 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.119
 kilometers 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 then it is an extremely economical and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.370
 with this diesel engine with a lot of 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:17.010
 power too hard and too much 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.690
 reliability as a river for those who do not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.790
 know the high injection system 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.489
 pressure for turbo engines now 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.739
 works with 2 bar pressure with 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.350
 improved combustion of pollutants 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.370
 which was already very low now 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.560
 smaller 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.320
 moreover the power of the law which 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.320
 increased to 200 horses with 51 pounds 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.769
 of torque and worth noting that with 1700 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.730
 90% of that touch power 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.730
 3d action 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.800
 another novelty that the chevrolet brings 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.709
 The 2014 Trail Blazers line is the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.450
 link with the green and the media which is a 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.330
 system allows the driver to work 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.830
 everything you have on your cell phone into the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.810
 car making the two 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.019
 interacted completely or 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.569
 songs photos videos everything can watch 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.970
 through the sea ​​link we have a critic of 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.069
 a link in prism and unix where the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.319
 My watch system is very low doing 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.920
 with which the driver takes his or her eyes from the 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.590
 and turn your eyes down on the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.430
 trail blazer the position on a link is 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.950
 perfect 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.860
 at the time of the hand then the driver 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.730
 does a slight deviation of the eyes and 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.650
 can sail in the clean sea and he has 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.079
 everything the driver needs in this 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.840
 version of trail blazers for travel 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.870
 such as the dvb or the city 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.970
 such as gps and mobile phone connection via 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.170
 bluetooth that is increasingly important 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.170
 has a vehicle 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.260
 as the idea is to show different 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.880
 4 situations blazer 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.310
 We come to the rural area of ​​the city. 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.000
 of sapucaia to get erosions and a 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.000
 little clay 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.180
 here is the baguette that has to pass the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.180
 ball 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.460
 on good without major problems 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.820
 this test I'm recording here in the zone 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.400
 rural of sapucaia and now we hope 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.200
 a second road to gps the road 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.500
 municipal 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.580
 julian cristina that connects the city of 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.580
 Sapucaia and mainstay 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.780
 the width of the three blazer allows 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.330
 put the car 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.430
 between the problems the tires between the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.830
 problems but this tire 245 70 16 lake 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.870
 enough to stare at a little hole 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.670
 heavier as is the case here and in the afternoon 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.700
 It's going down and time to go back to port. 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.700
 joyful 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.990
 the internal space for the laser is also 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.090
 very good 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.460
 all information is clear the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.700
 trip computer is easy to see to 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.800
 to navigate, just move this lever 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.090
 left side of the steering wheel can 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.040
 car computer info on board 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.170
 saving information also 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.930
 performance on a road during a 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.720
 trip has here also the mylink system 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.580
 that we already spoke and the commands in the 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.850
 steering wheel also easy 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.460
 the cruise control is very practical to push 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.930
 A finger-down button is activated. 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.690
 system 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.800
 Then you ask me more than the trail blazers. 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.770
 It is huge 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.840
 yes it is huge too large but the 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.110
 At the same time, it is very practical. 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.980
 good maneuverability is easy to drive 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.660
 easy to understand with the poet 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.190
 then this is a car that 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.160
 leaves us super at ease in the city 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.170
 and it is also ideal for travel 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.850
 divert this path here to a 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.370
 trip with the family especially this 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.870
 was the text brings the trail blazers 2014 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.300
 I tried to speak a little 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.790
 changes from that car to the 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.860
 latest version of the new features 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.710
 I was interested. 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.930
 dealer knows about this product is a 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.640
 sports utility vehicle that no doubt goes 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.400
 please many Brazilians who like 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.400
 of this type of car until the next end
