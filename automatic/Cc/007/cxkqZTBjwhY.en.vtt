00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
or any relics that have melee damage if

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.990 
or any relics that have melee damage if
you<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.079> law<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.949> order<00:00:56.190> specifically<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you have the law in order specifically I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.729

think<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.660> really<00:00:57.840> makes<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.710> breaks

rhyme<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.189> reason<00:01:29.280> yet<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.850> you'll<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
rhyme or reason yet but you'll have it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
rhyme or reason yet but you'll have it
all<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.570> built<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.920> go

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
all the way built up and you can go

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460 
all the way built up and you can go
ahead<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> again<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
ahead and just do it again so you just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
ahead and just do it again so you just
run<00:01:34.650> through<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> use<00:01:35.220> melee<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> crap<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
run through and use melee the crap and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
run through and use melee the crap and
everybody<00:01:36.659> now<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> downside<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> take

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
everybody now the downside is you take

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
everybody now the downside is you take
damage<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.909> mailing<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
damage when your mailing so if you're in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.929 
damage when your mailing so if you're in
an<00:01:40.170> area<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:40.920> lots<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> enemies

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
an area where there's lots of enemies

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
an area where there's lots of enemies
really<00:01:42.570> far<00:01:42.750> apart<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.530> really

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
really far apart it's going to be really

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
really far apart it's going to be really
really<00:01:44.130> tough<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> guys<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.299> run<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.659> to

damage and you can see right there that

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.470 
damage and you can see right there that
I'll<00:02:34.219> get<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.609> one<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.239> second

I'll get to that one in just a second

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.580 
I'll get to that one in just a second
what<00:02:35.569> just<00:02:35.719> happened<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.079> ended<00:02:36.469> up

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
what just happened there I ended up

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.720 
what just happened there I ended up
injuring<00:02:36.859> myself<00:02:37.069> which<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.549> another

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
injuring myself which is another

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.959 
injuring myself which is another
downside<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.269> this<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.829> log<00:02:40.040> gives<00:02:40.879> you<00:02:40.939> a

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
downside of this but the log gives you a

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.179 
downside of this but the log gives you a
hundred<00:02:41.120> percent<00:02:41.560> melee<00:02:42.560> damage<00:02:42.709> when<00:02:43.129> you

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
hundred percent melee damage when you

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.190 
hundred percent melee damage when you
have<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.639> combined<00:02:43.969> with<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> order<00:02:44.599> which<00:02:45.169> is

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
have it combined with the order which is

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.129 
have it combined with the order which is
a<00:02:45.680> shield<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.549> actually<00:02:47.000> replenishes<00:02:47.930> your

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
a shield it actually replenishes your

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.830 
a shield it actually replenishes your
life<00:02:48.590> every<00:02:48.980> time<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.250> melee<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:49.609> you<00:02:49.849> you'll

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
life every time you melee so you you'll

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.929 
life every time you melee so you you'll
see<00:02:51.079> that<00:02:51.109> I'll<00:02:51.439> basically<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.459> low

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
see that I'll basically have like low

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.610 
see that I'll basically have like low
life<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:53.959> all<00:02:54.049> of<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.169> sudden<00:02:54.199> I'll<00:02:54.469> nail

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
life and then all of a sudden I'll nail

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.869 
life and then all of a sudden I'll nail
and<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:54.889> can<00:02:55.010> see<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.189> refilling<00:02:55.579> right<00:02:55.699> there

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
and you can see it refilling right there

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.270 
and you can see it refilling right there
because<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.019> late<00:02:57.199> and<00:02:57.590> hit<00:02:57.799> somebody<00:02:58.069> so

tip is to go ahead and have a rocket in

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:32.979 
tip is to go ahead and have a rocket in
your<00:03:31.639> in<00:03:32.000> your<00:03:32.030> inventory<00:03:32.389> as<00:03:32.629> well<00:03:32.659> like<00:03:32.959> a

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
your in your inventory as well like a

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.080 
your in your inventory as well like a
good<00:03:33.109> one<00:03:33.409> and<00:03:33.560> make<00:03:34.099> sure<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:34.400> reloaded

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
good one and make sure it's reloaded

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.909 
good one and make sure it's reloaded
because<00:03:35.329> it<00:03:35.449> does<00:03:35.629> help<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.959> get<00:03:36.139> up<00:03:36.319> when<00:03:36.829> you

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
because it does help you get up when you

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.039 
because it does help you get up when you
get<00:03:37.069> down<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.430> will<00:03:37.579> get<00:03:37.759> down<00:03:37.909> pretty<00:03:38.750> easily

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
even with the law-and-order equipped and

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.259 
even with the law-and-order equipped and
because<00:03:43.099> your<00:03:43.250> shield<00:03:43.489> isn't<00:03:43.790> super<00:03:44.030> crazy

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
because your shield isn't super crazy

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.059 
because your shield isn't super crazy
because<00:03:44.419> you<00:03:44.569> have<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.870> order<00:03:45.349> but<00:03:45.799> anyway

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
because you have the order but anyway

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.159 
because you have the order but anyway
you<00:03:46.879> can<00:03:47.030> see<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.269> havoc<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.019> thing

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
you can see the havoc that this thing

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:48.580 
you can see the havoc that this thing
wrecks

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
wrecks

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.110 
wrecks
now<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:48.889> downside<00:03:49.129> is<00:03:49.519> when<00:03:49.879> you're<00:03:50.030> doing

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
now the downside is when you're doing

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.300 
now the downside is when you're doing
this<00:03:50.329> melee<00:03:50.599> rampage<00:03:51.139> he<00:03:51.799> has<00:03:51.919> a<00:03:51.949> twelve

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
this melee rampage he has a twelve

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.679 
this melee rampage he has a twelve
percent<00:03:52.609> chance<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.060> he<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.209> actually<00:03:53.540> hit

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
percent chance that he can actually hit

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.390 
percent chance that he can actually hit
himself<00:03:53.870> right<00:03:54.500> there<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.739> think<00:03:54.889> he<00:03:55.040> just<00:03:55.250> did

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
himself right there I think he just did

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.949 
himself right there I think he just did
it<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.639> if<00:03:56.060> he<00:03:56.150> hits<00:03:56.299> himself<00:03:56.479> he<00:03:56.750> takes

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
it and if he hits himself he takes

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.050 
it and if he hits himself he takes
damage<00:03:57.169> so<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:58.099> kind<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:58.579> a<00:03:58.609> ridiculous

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
damage so it's kind of like a ridiculous

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.699 
damage so it's kind of like a ridiculous
thing<00:03:59.419> but<00:03:59.689> it's<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.169> makes<00:04:00.319> it<00:04:00.500> kind<00:04:00.680> of

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
thing but it's it makes it kind of

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.159 
thing but it's it makes it kind of
really<00:04:00.949> crappy<00:04:01.189> but<00:04:01.969> at<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.150> same<00:04:02.299> time<00:04:02.540> I

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
really crappy but at the same time I

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.809 
really crappy but at the same time I
mean<00:04:03.530> 12<00:04:03.889> percent<00:04:04.219> chance<00:04:04.430> that's<00:04:04.639> like

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
mean 12 percent chance that's like

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.670 
mean 12 percent chance that's like
basically<00:04:05.540> 1<00:04:05.689> out<00:04:05.780> of<00:04:05.810> every<00:04:05.989> 10<00:04:06.259> strikes

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
basically 1 out of every 10 strikes

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.559 
basically 1 out of every 10 strikes
potentially<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.180> end<00:04:08.329> up<00:04:08.419> hitting

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
potentially you can end up hitting

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.270 
potentially you can end up hitting
yourself<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.139> if<00:04:09.199> you<00:04:09.290> hit<00:04:09.409> yourself<00:04:09.769> when

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
yourself and if you hit yourself when

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.729 
yourself and if you hit yourself when
you're<00:04:10.959> when<00:04:11.959> your<00:04:12.049> life<00:04:12.169> is<00:04:12.349> already<00:04:12.469> down

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
you're when your life is already down

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:13.839 
you're when your life is already down
you're<00:04:13.039> you're<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.519> going<00:04:13.669> to<00:04:13.699> end<00:04:13.789> up

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
you're you're just going to end up

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.339 
you're you're just going to end up
killing<00:04:14.090> yourself<00:04:14.449> so<00:04:14.629> I've<00:04:14.870> done<00:04:15.049> that<00:04:15.199> many

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
killing yourself so I've done that many

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.349 
killing yourself so I've done that many
times<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.919> I'm<00:04:16.280> killing<00:04:16.489> myself<00:04:16.759> and<00:04:17.120> then

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
times and I'm killing myself and then

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.420 
times and I'm killing myself and then
downing<00:04:17.690> myself<00:04:18.019> in<00:04:18.409> front<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.859> large<00:04:19.039> boss

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
downing myself in front of a large boss

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.029 
downing myself in front of a large boss
and<00:04:19.820> then<00:04:20.030> ended<00:04:20.570> up<00:04:20.719> just<00:04:21.229> dying<00:04:21.650> because<00:04:21.919> I

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
and then ended up just dying because I

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.610 
and then ended up just dying because I
couldn't<00:04:22.400> get<00:04:22.849> up<00:04:23.029> because<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.750> had<00:04:24.080> no<00:04:24.320> way<00:04:24.590> of

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
with a rocket so if you're fighting a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.290 
with a rocket so if you're fighting a
big<00:04:36.199> boss<00:04:36.610> chances<00:04:37.610> are<00:04:37.760> you're<00:04:37.910> not<00:04:37.940> going<00:04:38.240> to

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
big boss chances are you're not going to

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.640 
big boss chances are you're not going to
be<00:04:38.360> able<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.540> even<00:04:38.690> get<00:04:38.840> back<00:04:38.990> up<00:04:39.199> with<00:04:39.620> a

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
be able to even get back up with a

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.560 
be able to even get back up with a
rocket<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:40.160> there<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.610> pluses<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.150> minuses<00:04:41.510> to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
rocket so there is pluses and minuses to

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.629 
rocket so there is pluses and minuses to
this<00:04:41.780> setup<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.590> pluses<00:04:42.979> are<00:04:43.100> definitely<00:04:43.490> for

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
this setup the pluses are definitely for

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.850 
this setup the pluses are definitely for
in<00:04:43.820> close<00:04:44.030> quarter<00:04:44.600> combat<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.229> you<00:04:45.560> can<00:04:45.710> just

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
in close quarter combat and you can just

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.650 
in close quarter combat and you can just
hack<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.580> slash<00:04:46.729> away<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.060> victory

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
hack and slash away to victory

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.379 
hack and slash away to victory
the<00:04:48.020> downside<00:04:48.470> is<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.889> if<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.610> go<00:04:49.850> ahead<00:04:49.970> and

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
the downside is is if you go ahead and

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.920 
the downside is is if you go ahead and
you<00:04:50.570> try<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.780> do<00:04:50.990> this<00:04:51.280> with<00:04:52.280> with<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.270> big<00:04:53.720> boss

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
you try to do this with with a big boss

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.060 
you try to do this with with a big boss
or<00:04:54.199> something<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.740> if<00:04:54.860> they're<00:04:54.979> just

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
or something like that if they're just

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.860 
or something like that if they're just
like<00:04:55.250> two<00:04:55.370> bosses<00:04:55.520> on<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:55.940> screen<00:04:56.210> like<00:04:56.690> we
