 faster beer and beer to 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 making this recipe is very easy for people 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 will use only two ingredients to 500 ml 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 of tea and a gelatine envelope without 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.199
 flavor in place of xavi can also use 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.300
 guaraná an apple juice is of those of powder 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.369
 so they also have this color unintentionally 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 a beer agents or chamomile tea 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 recipe just get five women said 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 charles and stop there we will dissolve 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 the gelatine envelope in this tea and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 let it rest there for 15 minutes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 then I'll put this mixture for 15 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.159
 seconds in microwave for melting 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 then you will then mix this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 gelatin melted charlie in the rest 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 the tea in another another container is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.350
 It's important that I 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 any liquid that will be used to make 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 this beer had in temperature 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.640
 because it has frozen and dry 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 in the area and put your routine will goes 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240
 going to the cheese business will get a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 another vaccine zinc a little water with 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 ice to put on top of this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.850
 mix to cool down faster 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 will continue to stir while the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.320
 low temperature to test with the finger 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 the cooler university and when 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 It's already starting to get cold 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.570
 we start beating fast to the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.640
 mixing is important. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.710
 lowering your limeira gelatin temperature 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.520
 to make 6 the criciúma will keep 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.610
 so he is 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.620
 exists and will not disappear in there will stay 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.450
 with that face of foam on beer 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.250
 then just put this mixture in the glass and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.410

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.730
