nice<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.250> feature<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:31.040> jumping<00:01:32.040> into

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
nice little feature to have jumping into

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
nice little feature to have jumping into
the<00:01:32.430> skeleton<00:01:33.000> cases<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.840> use<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the skeleton cases here I use the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140 
the skeleton cases here I use the
skeleton<00:01:34.710> cases<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:35.850> for

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
skeleton cases just just about for

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.179 
skeleton cases just just about for
everything<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.990> reason<00:01:37.259> being<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.799> have

I<00:02:46.290> personally<00:02:46.590> film<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.220> protune<00:02:47.610> because<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
I personally film in protune because it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.550 
I personally film in protune because it
makes<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.540> much<00:02:48.600> easier<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.440> me<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
makes it that much easier for me to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.110 
makes it that much easier for me to

back<00:03:22.770> in<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.010> day<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:24.300> was<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.780> huge

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
back in the day and that was a huge

one of the best 3d editing software's
out<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.850> mean<00:03:30.060> we've<00:03:30.480> used<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.170> many

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
out there I mean we've used so many

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.540 
out there I mean we've used so many
different<00:03:31.620> things<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:31.980> I've<00:03:32.100> found<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.430> it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
different things and I've found that it

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.510 
different things and I've found that it
makes<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.330> simple<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.260> easy<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.860> recognizes

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
makes it so simple so easy it recognizes

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.010 
makes it so simple so easy it recognizes
both<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.940> files<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.300> can<00:03:36.480> take<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.810> set

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
both of the files you can take and set

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.660 
both of the files you can take and set
your<00:03:37.410> convergence<00:03:37.980> points<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.459> everything

your convergence points and everything

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.120 
your convergence points and everything
I'll<00:03:39.540> do<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> video<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.170> little<00:03:40.290> more<00:03:40.620> depth<00:03:40.920> in

the 3d stuff later on I feel like a lot

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.530 
the 3d stuff later on I feel like a lot
of<00:03:43.739> people<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.130> bastardized<00:03:44.910> 3d<00:03:45.360> because

slide in your GoPro camera and you're
good<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.400> go<00:04:11.519> I<00:04:11.910> use<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.660> lot<00:04:13.019> now<00:04:13.290> used<00:04:13.650> to

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
good to go I use this a lot now used to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.350 
good to go I use this a lot now used to
use<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> roll<00:04:14.160> bar<00:04:14.370> mount<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.760> lot<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:15.209> now

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
use the roll bar mount a lot but now

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.940 
use the roll bar mount a lot but now
that<00:04:15.540> they<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:15.930> jaws<00:04:16.320> clamp<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that they have this jaws clamp and the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.979 
that they have this jaws clamp and the
gooseneck<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.669> find<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.299> use<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.630> that

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
gooseneck I find that I use this that

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.960 
gooseneck I find that I use this that
much<00:04:19.260> more<00:04:19.560> often<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.220> past<00:04:20.609> you'd<00:04:20.790> have

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
much more often in the past you'd have

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.390 
much more often in the past you'd have
to<00:04:21.150> tighten<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.810> loosen<00:04:22.020> different<00:04:22.680> points

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
to tighten and loosen different points

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.250 
to tighten and loosen different points
of<00:04:23.520> contact<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.450> able<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.720> move

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
of contact to be able to move

camera<00:04:25.590> angle<00:04:26.040> now<00:04:26.310> with<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.520> gooseneck<00:04:26.940> all

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
camera angle now with this gooseneck all

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.310 
camera angle now with this gooseneck all
you<00:04:27.210> have<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.450> do<00:04:27.540> is<00:04:27.660> take<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.110> bend

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
you have to do is take and just bend
