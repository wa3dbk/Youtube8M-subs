remote desktop on the computer that we

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.300 
remote desktop on the computer that we
want<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.640> eventually<00:02:59.879> control<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.099> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
want to eventually control so we do that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.670 
want to eventually control so we do that
by<00:03:02.519> going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.299> start<00:03:03.630> right<00:03:04.080> clicking<00:03:04.380> my

by going to start right clicking my
computer<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:06.470> properties<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.739> then

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
computer going properties there and then

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.610 
computer going properties there and then
go<00:03:08.370> into<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.700> remote<00:03:08.849> tab<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:10.200> clicking

on here that allows this computer to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.839 
on here that allows this computer to
later<00:03:13.140> be<00:03:13.230> remotely<00:03:13.950> controlled<00:03:14.099> if<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
later be remotely controlled if you

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.550 
later be remotely controlled if you
don't<00:03:15.000> do<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.329> then<00:03:15.599> you're<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.349> going<00:03:16.470> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
don't do that then you're not going to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.960 
don't do that then you're not going to
be<00:03:16.620> able<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.799> do<00:03:16.860> anything<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.459> next<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.849> want

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
be able to do anything so next we want

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.270 
be able to do anything so next we want
to<00:03:21.060> find<00:03:21.329> out<00:03:21.480> our<00:03:21.510> local<00:03:22.140> IP<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.920> same

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
to find out our local IP for the same

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.819 
to find out our local IP for the same
machine<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:23.849> we<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.150> configured<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:25.680> want

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
machine that we just configured we want

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.729 
machine that we just configured we want
to<00:03:25.890> find<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:27.500> IP<00:03:28.500> locally<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:31.049> we<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> a

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
to find out the IP locally so we go to a

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.789 
to find out the IP locally so we go to a
command<00:03:32.130> prompt<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.610> type<00:03:32.700> ipconfig<00:03:33.799> and

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
command prompt and type ipconfig and

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.819 
command prompt and type ipconfig and
that's<00:03:35.760> going<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> tell<00:03:36.900> us<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:37.530> this

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
that's going to tell us all this

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.009 
that's going to tell us all this
information<00:03:38.130> about<00:03:38.670> IP<00:03:39.180> addresses<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
information about IP addresses and

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.940 
information about IP addresses and
things<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.010> right<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.450> have<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.950> IP

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
things so right here we have the IP

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.759 
things so right here we have the IP
address<00:03:44.220> locally<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.299> machine<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.019> we

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
address locally of this machine and we

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.090 
address locally of this machine and we
also<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.639> default<00:03:47.819> gateway<00:03:48.450> IP<00:03:48.630> or<00:03:49.139> the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
also have the default gateway IP or the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.509 
also have the default gateway IP or the
IP<00:03:50.280> address<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.940> local<00:03:51.480> router<00:03:52.069> so<00:03:53.069> we<00:03:53.250> but

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
IP address of the local router so we but

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:03.460 
IP address of the local router so we but
we<00:03:53.670> need<00:03:53.850> both<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.239> those<00:03:54.359> things

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.010 

so<00:04:04.040> next<00:04:04.460> we<00:04:04.640> need<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.910> configure<00:04:05.360> port

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
so next we need to configure port

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.500 
so next we need to configure port
forwarding<00:04:06.530> on<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.860> router<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.180> we<00:04:08.330> do

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
forwarding on the router the way we do

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.420 
forwarding on the router the way we do
this<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.750> we<00:04:08.990> open<00:04:09.200> up<00:04:09.440> an<00:04:09.620> internet<00:04:10.070> browser

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
this is we open up an internet browser

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.370 
this is we open up an internet browser
we<00:04:11.330> connect<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:13.840> we<00:04:14.840> connect<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.260> the

connection<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:08.000> i'm<00:05:08.060> going<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.270> say<00:05:08.450> that

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
connection so i'm going to say that

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.630 
connection so i'm going to say that
anything<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.080> comes<00:05:09.290> into<00:05:09.530> 3389<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.460> going

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
anything that comes into 3389 is going

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.950 
anything that comes into 3389 is going
to<00:05:10.700> be<00:05:10.790> sent<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.740> 210<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.890> 288<00:05:13.790> that<00:05:14.090> 8888<00:05:14.810> or

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
to be sent to 210 to 288 that 8888 or

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.390 
to be sent to 210 to 288 that 8888 or
one<00:05:15.080> or<00:05:15.110> two<00:05:15.290> which<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.680> IP<00:05:15.860> address<00:05:16.040> that

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
one or two which is the IP address that

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.969 
one or two which is the IP address that
i<00:05:16.430> want<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.910> connect<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.720> remotely<00:05:18.080> later<00:05:18.380> so

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
i want to connect to remotely later so

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.340 
i want to connect to remotely later so
we<00:05:19.070> do<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.310> same<00:05:19.520> thing<00:05:19.729> for<00:05:19.850> VNC<00:05:20.570> which<00:05:20.990> uses

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
we do the same thing for VNC which uses

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.550 
we do the same thing for VNC which uses
this<00:05:21.590> port<00:05:21.979> number<00:05:22.850> instead<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.990> we<00:05:24.169> send<00:05:24.410> it

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
this port number instead and we send it

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.250 
this port number instead and we send it
to<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.800> same<00:05:25.210> IP<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.660> machine<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.110> we

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
to the same IP of the machine that we

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.870 
to the same IP of the machine that we
eventually<00:05:27.560> want<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.950> connect<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.610> that's

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
eventually want to connect it and that's

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.870 
eventually want to connect it and that's
the<00:05:28.970> local<00:05:29.450> IP<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:30.169> other<00:05:30.320> machine<00:05:30.880> so

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
the local IP of that other machine so

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.170 
the local IP of that other machine so
we're<00:05:32.030> done<00:05:32.210> that<00:05:32.540> we<00:05:33.669> configured<00:05:34.669> that<00:05:34.910> and

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
we're done that we configured that and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.030 
we're done that we configured that and
now<00:05:35.240> we're<00:05:35.419> done<00:05:35.630> that<00:05:35.840> part

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.210 

so

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.760 

see<00:05:43.850> here<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:44.390> now<00:05:44.630> we<00:05:45.140> want<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.410> find<00:05:45.590> the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
see here so now we want to find the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.310 
see here so now we want to find the
outside<00:05:46.310> IP<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.030> is<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.690> IP<00:05:48.080> address

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
outside IP and this is the IP address

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.250 
outside IP and this is the IP address
that<00:05:48.740> your<00:05:48.920> router<00:05:49.190> has<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:50.450> world<00:05:50.750> to<00:05:51.140> the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
that your router has to the world to the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.490 
that your router has to the world to the
Internet<00:05:51.950> to<00:05:52.130> your<00:05:52.610> outside<00:05:53.360> IP<00:05:53.540> so<00:05:54.290> the<00:05:54.380> way

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
Internet to your outside IP so the way

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.310 
Internet to your outside IP so the way
we<00:05:54.650> can<00:05:54.800> find<00:05:54.830> that<00:05:55.160> out<00:05:55.460> is<00:05:55.490> we<00:05:55.970> again<00:05:56.540> open<00:05:57.140> up

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
we can find that out is we again open up

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.740 
we can find that out is we again open up
an<00:05:57.530> internet<00:05:58.070> browser<00:05:58.450> and<00:06:00.700> we<00:06:01.700> just<00:06:02.360> tons<00:06:02.630> of

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
an internet browser and we just tons of

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.850 
an internet browser and we just tons of
websites<00:06:02.900> out<00:06:03.200> there<00:06:03.260> that<00:06:03.410> will<00:06:03.560> give<00:06:03.740> you

websites out there that will give you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.430 
websites out there that will give you
outside<00:06:04.310> IP<00:06:04.490> so<00:06:05.330> you<00:06:05.780> can<00:06:05.900> just<00:06:06.080> type<00:06:06.230> in

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
outside IP so you can just type in

that's their just so nobody can actually
connect<00:06:29.600> to<00:06:29.720> my<00:06:29.840> machine<00:06:30.410> so<00:06:31.250> now<00:06:31.370> how<00:06:31.490> do<00:06:31.550> we

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
connect to my machine so now how do we

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.270 
connect to my machine so now how do we
connect<00:06:31.970> via<00:06:32.150> rdp<00:06:32.390> well<00:06:33.200> we<00:06:33.440> open<00:06:33.710> up<00:06:33.770> our<00:06:33.950> DP

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
connect via rdp well we open up our DP

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.270 
connect via rdp well we open up our DP
on<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.850> Windows<00:06:35.540> machine<00:06:35.570> if<00:06:36.440> you<00:06:36.620> can<00:06:36.770> find<00:06:37.040> it

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
on a Windows machine if you can find it

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.520 
on a Windows machine if you can find it
on<00:06:37.460> this<00:06:38.000> case<00:06:38.210> is<00:06:38.330> already<00:06:38.540> open<00:06:38.660> for<00:06:39.020> us<00:06:39.140> we

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
on this case is already open for us we

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.150 
on this case is already open for us we
type<00:06:39.770> in<00:06:39.950> that<00:06:40.390> outside<00:06:41.390> IP<00:06:42.290> that<00:06:42.860> we<00:06:42.980> got

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
type in that outside IP that we got

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.570 
type in that outside IP that we got
earlier<00:06:43.520> which<00:06:44.000> is<00:06:44.030> displayed<00:06:44.660> below<00:06:45.580> and

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
earlier which is displayed below and

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.270 
earlier which is displayed below and
then<00:06:47.210> we<00:06:47.330> just<00:06:47.450> say<00:06:47.570> connect<00:06:47.960> and<00:06:48.169> now<00:06:48.320> once<00:06:49.070> we

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
then we just say connect and now once we

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.030 
then we just say connect and now once we
we<00:06:50.060> connect<00:06:50.480> to<00:06:50.630> it<00:06:50.810> we<00:06:51.020> can<00:06:51.050> remotely<00:06:51.590> connect

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
we connect to it we can remotely connect

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.890 
we connect to it we can remotely connect
that<00:06:52.220> to<00:06:52.460> that<00:06:52.700> computer<00:06:52.910> we<00:06:53.180> can<00:06:53.270> control<00:06:53.690> it

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
that to that computer we can control it

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.409 
that to that computer we can control it
remotely<00:06:54.370> which<00:06:55.370> it's<00:06:55.490> pretty<00:06:55.730> pretty<00:06:56.180> cool

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
remotely which it's pretty pretty cool

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.600 
remotely which it's pretty pretty cool
so<00:06:57.050> there<00:06:57.260> it<00:06:57.350> is<00:06:57.380> I'm<00:06:57.830> not<00:06:58.070> going<00:06:58.220> to<00:06:58.310> go<00:06:58.400> any

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
so there it is I'm not going to go any

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.750 
so there it is I'm not going to go any
further<00:06:58.790> but<00:06:59.240> you<00:06:59.540> can<00:06:59.720> log<00:07:00.470> in<00:07:00.710> there<00:07:00.950> and<00:07:01.160> do

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
further but you can log in there and do

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.180 
further but you can log in there and do
whatever<00:07:01.940> you<00:07:02.090> want<00:07:02.270> so<00:07:02.840> if<00:07:03.710> you<00:07:03.890> want<00:07:04.040> to<00:07:04.100> use

whatever you want so if you want to use

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.190 
whatever you want so if you want to use
VNC<00:07:04.430> instead<00:07:05.240> of<00:07:05.360> using<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:06.710> supplied<00:07:08.200> remote

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.760 
VNC instead of using the supplied remote
desktop<00:07:09.650> you<00:07:09.830> look<00:07:10.310> for<00:07:10.520> VNC<00:07:10.790> here

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
desktop you look for VNC here

so as to be in CS be installed on both
machines<00:07:21.770> so<00:07:22.770> we<00:07:22.950> type<00:07:23.100> in<00:07:23.280> that<00:07:23.490> same<00:07:24.320> IP

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
will connect to the router and then the

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.050 
will connect to the router and then the
router<00:07:29.400> will<00:07:29.720> forward<00:07:30.720> that<00:07:31.530> request<00:07:32.190> to<00:07:32.670> the

router will forward that request to the
local<00:07:33.930> machine<00:07:34.290> that<00:07:34.470> we<00:07:34.530> want<00:07:34.740> it<00:07:34.830> to<00:07:34.860> connect

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 
local machine that we want it to connect

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.400 
local machine that we want it to connect
to<00:07:35.370> and<00:07:35.700> that's<00:07:35.910> it<00:07:36.090> then<00:07:36.630> we<00:07:36.750> can<00:07:36.930> type<00:07:37.110> in<00:07:37.290> the

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.410 
to and that's it then we can type in the

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.500 
to and that's it then we can type in the
password<00:07:37.440> here<00:07:38.070> and<00:07:38.250> then<00:07:38.730> we<00:07:38.850> can<00:07:38.880> connect<00:07:39.390> to

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:39.510 
password here and then we can connect to

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.180 
password here and then we can connect to
it<00:07:39.660> via<00:07:40.140> VNC<00:07:40.560> and<00:07:41.010> remotely<00:07:41.520> control<00:07:42.000> it
