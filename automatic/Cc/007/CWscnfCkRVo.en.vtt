00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.760 
but who was it when you were growing up
I<00:01:27.149> think<00:01:28.149> when<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.450> was<00:01:28.479> growing<00:01:28.659> up<00:01:29.109> in<00:01:29.409> South

I think when I was growing up in South

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.819 
I think when I was growing up in South
Carolina<00:01:30.429> I<00:01:31.240> wasn't<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.899> real<00:01:32.049> big<00:01:32.200> Braves<00:01:32.530> fan

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
Carolina I wasn't a real big Braves fan

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.440 
Carolina I wasn't a real big Braves fan
like<00:01:33.219> everybody<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.820> air<00:01:33.939> was<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.119> Braves

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
like everybody in the air was a Braves

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.800 
like everybody in the air was a Braves
fan<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.799> would<00:01:36.609> probably<00:01:36.820> have<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.149> say<00:01:37.359> I<00:01:37.390> was

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
fan I would probably have to say I was

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.399 
fan I would probably have to say I was
probably<00:01:38.079> more<00:01:39.570> probably<00:01:40.570> more<00:01:40.719> of<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.899> Rangers

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
probably more probably more of a Rangers

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.109 
probably more probably more of a Rangers

really<00:02:37.410> well<00:02:37.650> together<00:02:38.090> though<00:02:39.090> they're

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
really well together though they're

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.630

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
rookies they function well as a unit so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
rookies they function well as a unit so
I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.990> best<00:02:43.170> thing<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:43.770> is

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
I think the best thing that we can do is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.550 
I think the best thing that we can do is
divide<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.370> conquer<00:02:44.760> separate<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.560> take

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
divide and conquer separate and take

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.870 
divide and conquer separate and take
those<00:02:46.740> boys<00:02:46.980> under<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.310> learning<00:02:47.580> tree
