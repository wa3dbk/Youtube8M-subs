Vegas<00:00:04.380> preview<00:00:05.009> window<00:00:05.660> so<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:06.870> gonna<00:00:07.049> import

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
Vegas preview window so I'm gonna import

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:21.740 
Vegas preview window so I'm gonna import
our<00:00:07.649> file<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:17.300> as<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.869> when<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.770> move<00:00:20.750> my

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
our file and as you see when I move my

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.310 
our file and as you see when I move my
cursor<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.740> timeline<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> frame<00:00:25.019> rates

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
cursor or the timeline the frame rates

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.080 
cursor or the timeline the frame rates
over<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.699> buffering<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:29.490> playback

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
over here are buffering and the playback

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.920 
over here are buffering and the playback
was<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.720> smooth<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.690> kind

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
was not smooth so if you have this kind

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
was not smooth so if you have this kind
of<00:00:37.110> lag<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.129> can't<00:00:38.399> able<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.000> edit<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> video

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of lag you can't able to edit the video

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
of lag you can't able to edit the video
in<00:00:40.110> real<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.809> this<00:00:42.809> make<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.739> very<00:00:44.100> hard

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in real time and this make you very hard

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.049 
in real time and this make you very hard
to<00:00:44.969> find<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.960> exact<00:00:46.410> let's<00:00:47.219> make<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> really

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to find the exact let's make you really

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.299 
to find the exact let's make you really
hard<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.809> find<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> exact<00:00:49.800> frame<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.520> edit

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
hard to find the exact frame for edit

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.080 
hard to find the exact frame for edit
just<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.809> lag<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.789> many

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
just see so much lag so on many

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.740 
just see so much lag so on many
tutorials<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:58.079> said<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:59.210> when<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.359> change

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
tutorials they said like when we change

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
tutorials they said like when we change
the<00:01:00.870> preview<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:02.550> draft<00:01:03.239> half<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.909> reduce

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the preview to draft half it will reduce

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.340 
the preview to draft half it will reduce
the<00:01:06.270> lag<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.500> still<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.760> lagging

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.530 

so<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.540> trick<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.940> have<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.300> download

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
so so the trick is you have to download

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.250 
so so the trick is you have to download
a<00:01:17.870> program<00:01:18.530> known<00:01:18.830> as<00:01:18.860> former<00:01:19.460> factory<00:01:20.260> this

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
a program known as former factory this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.310 
a program known as former factory this
is<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> freeware<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.729> I<00:01:23.210> will<00:01:23.510> put<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> link<00:01:24.140> in

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
is a freeware so I will put a link in

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.650 
is a freeware so I will put a link in
the<00:01:24.350> description<00:01:24.760> so<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.970> can<00:01:26.360> find

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
the description so that you can find

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:34.630 
the description so that you can find
this<00:01:26.840> program<00:01:28.119> easily<00:01:29.800> after<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:33.580> go<00:01:34.580> to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
this program easily after that go to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.290 
this program easily after that go to
your<00:01:34.820> source<00:01:35.330> file

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.380 

and<00:01:40.710> convert<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.920> high<00:01:42.460> resolution<00:01:42.820> file

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
and convert the high resolution file

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.550 
and convert the high resolution file
into<00:01:44.020> low<00:01:44.560> resolution<00:01:45.130> file<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:47.170> for<00:01:47.410> this

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
into low resolution file so for this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.070 
into low resolution file so for this
tutorial<00:01:47.770> I'm<00:01:48.040> gonna<00:01:48.250> convert<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.690> mp4

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
tutorial I'm gonna convert this to mp4

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.570 
tutorial I'm gonna convert this to mp4
and<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:52.240> sitting<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.980> is<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.280> lowest

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
and in sitting so this is the lowest

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.920 
and in sitting so this is the lowest
setting<00:01:54.910> available<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:56.140> format<00:01:57.130> Factory

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
setting available in format Factory

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.710 
setting available in format Factory
so<00:01:59.220> okay<00:02:00.660> okay<00:02:02.070> start

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.620 

so<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.980> will<00:02:08.130> take<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.670> time<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.150> convert

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
so it will take some time to convert

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.449 
so it will take some time to convert
this<00:02:09.810> video

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.750 

once<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.450> conversion<00:02:15.720> has<00:02:16.079> been<00:02:16.319> completed

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
once the conversion has been completed

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.110 
once the conversion has been completed
go<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.030> folder<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.849> this<00:02:23.849> is<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
go to the folder so this is the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.380 
go to the folder so this is the
converted<00:02:24.569> file<00:02:25.310> low<00:02:26.310> resolution<00:02:26.819> file<00:02:27.120> which

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
converted file low resolution file which

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.830 
converted file low resolution file which
is<00:02:27.540> 57<00:02:28.290> MB<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.030> high<00:02:30.239> res<00:02:30.540> file

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
is 57 MB and this is the high res file

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:43.340 
is 57 MB and this is the high res file
which<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.859> 1.3<00:02:32.760> TV<00:02:33.709> now<00:02:34.709> open<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.400> Sony<00:02:35.879> Vegas

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:57.530 

and<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:44.160> import<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.180> low-resolution<00:02:46.080> file

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.800 

so

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.640 

so<00:03:04.810> once<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.409> import<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:06.069> file<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:08.110> can<00:03:08.319> see

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so once you import the file you can see

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.530 
so once you import the file you can see
now<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.489> was<00:03:10.269> lagging<00:03:10.750> less<00:03:11.970> than<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
now it was lagging less than the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.539 
now it was lagging less than the
original<00:03:15.480> even<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.780> go<00:03:17.170> for<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.010> best<00:03:18.189> view

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
original even I go for the best view

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:28.349 
original even I go for the best view
auto<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:20.620> look<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.909> don't<00:03:22.359> plug<00:03:23.040> much<00:03:25.980> now<00:03:27.359> what

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
auto it look it don't plug much now what

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.190 
auto it look it don't plug much now what
the<00:03:28.510> idea<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:29.519> here<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:31.150> low<00:03:31.390> resolution<00:03:31.629> file

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
the idea is here the low resolution file

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.629 
the idea is here the low resolution file
you<00:03:32.590> can<00:03:32.829> start<00:03:33.189> editing<00:03:33.400> your<00:03:34.019> project<00:03:38.639> can

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
you can start editing your project can
