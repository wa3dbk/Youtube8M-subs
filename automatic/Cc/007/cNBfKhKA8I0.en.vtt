 the parties the three parts coast explained 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.839
 that adn 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.839
 and if lopo has an Aztec god 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.490
 the xerez the aztec god of war 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.189
 p the Aztecs for a hundred pit walk they had towards some cookies with the shape 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 of the god 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.170
 those amaranto py and ate them 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.899
 in the belief that that would give them min the powers of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.300
 of the god 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.230
 fact 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.810
 God that gave him the cookies were 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.660
 were the proteins that have in the sea antonio samaranch n 18 percent of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.990
 proteins in the diet of the Aztecs was 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.390
 quite protein deficient 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 food to the Spanish conquistadors and met in this ritual 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.300
 then it seemed that they are those of figurines with the form of gods and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 eating them is too much like communion there is now 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.510
 why not do it in percent in a way 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.370
 n 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.630
 without yunus 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.430
 the whole amaranth crop was directly seen 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.950
 and for this reason the amaranth as I say then c 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 I had a lot of cd proteins and it was a food 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.660
 he was a crop completely forgotten during 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.010
 for many centuries 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.480
 until recently just a few decades ago 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 c recovered 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.970
 this molecule we are here excel he said the glyphosate is the component 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.990
 active of him the most used vih-aids in the world 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.049
 which is called tweet whose trade name is percent to 1 the branch the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.950
 commercializes the company is a multinational in those of the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.980
 biotechnology 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.830
 let it be monsanto 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.180
 that also yields the herbicide 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.980
 sells genetically modified seeds to support greater 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 amounts of it of the herbicide 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.130
 in the year 2007 henne in arizona 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:16.049
 per cent whole harvests d band planned to boost does that already 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.999
 genetically modified to 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.999
 efe after supporting large amounts of this herbicide 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.179
 percent and were lost because of a herbicide-resistant weed 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:31.169
 and it is resistant to all the good ones all the attempts that were made of 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.779
 weed valcarce 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.009
 this weed was none other than him the amaranth 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.849
 and curiously one of the varieties of amaranth that the Aztecs cultivated for 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.849
 for food 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.409
 this the musac and the xerez norman norman borlaug 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 all that he is father of the green revolution 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.249
 are you was a movement during the 60s 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.479
 what by percent developments in denying it technology 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.169
 he managed to make this one many countries were 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.679
 per cent self-sufficient fundersta CDs food 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.089
 - Nobel of peace percent is considered to save about a thousand 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.589
 millions of human lives 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:19.719
 a dom norman population said that his dream his biotechnological dream was 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.979
 pass resistance to the clear 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.439
 of rice 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.150
 to the gob others spend the amount of wheat proteins 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.559
 to rice 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.959
 p neither of the two things have been able to do 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.219
 but even though he was still working for a long time in which 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.009
 Mexico 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.449
 later in the neighborhood front a harvest 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.819
 with more proteins than wheat and better resistance and better agronomic profile 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.629
 that he is 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.009
 that rice 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.009
 which was precisely the amaranth 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.049
 not the amaranth does not stop being an 9 an example 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.669
 percent an interesting example 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.359
 Of how 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.290
 p 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.169
 Many forgotten crops could have a very important role 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.089
 the fao calculates that in Álava history have been cultivated about seven thousand species 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:15.129
 for human consumption currently lacks cultivated only three thousand 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.529
 which only about 150 have economic interest 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.609
 only four 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.870
 wheat, rice, soybeans and corn 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.129
 person of 50 percent of the world's cultivated area 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.569
 and only seven 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.369
 80 of 85% of the calories consumed by humanity 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.960
 no norman borlaug 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.919
 the team deserves min 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.970
 very humbly that the green revolution was only a temporary success 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.139
 we really need a second green revolution we are immersed in 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.669
 the summits plus a green revolution 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:51.919
 i 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.199
 there are many fronts in which we must be in that second revolution 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:55.960
 green 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.240
 but not of them without a doubt 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.330
 today he explained midas of rediscovering crops that have been forgotten in him 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.669
 last 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.949
 and use them to 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.289
 ed in figures for the future 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.289
 Utah 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.819
 the these 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.650
 The three parts coast explained
