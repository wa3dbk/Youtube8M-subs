pretty<00:00:21.630> easy<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.109> make<00:00:22.400> because<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> just

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
pretty easy to make because I just

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.769 
pretty easy to make because I just
modified<00:00:24.650> my<00:00:26.210> other<00:00:27.210> gun<00:00:27.570> platform<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:29.779> just

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
modified my other gun platform I just

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.900 
modified my other gun platform I just
slightly<00:00:31.080> modified<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.520> came<00:00:32.700> out

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
slightly modified it and it came out

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
slightly modified it and it came out
with<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:35.120> that's<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.170> I'd

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
with this so that's really all it is I'd

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.200 
with this so that's really all it is I'd
say<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:37.980> probably<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.489> best<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.059> ever

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
say it's probably the best kind of ever

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.889

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.070 
side to safety fire so see it's on both
sides<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.179> up<00:02:10.360> here<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.810> mainly

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
sides I have this is up here is mainly

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.910 
sides I have this is up here is mainly
for<00:02:11.260> looks<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.459> keep<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.820> slide<00:02:13.120> aligned

for looks and to keep the slide aligned

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.900 
for looks and to keep the slide aligned
because<00:02:14.920> these<00:02:15.459> bars<00:02:16.209> would<00:02:16.600> kind<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:16.959> go<00:02:17.200> out

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
because these bars would kind of go out

see what I was just talking about to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.030 
see what I was just talking about to
keep<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.519> knees<00:02:34.299> aligned<00:02:34.860> because<00:02:35.860> these

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
keep the knees aligned because these

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800 
keep the knees aligned because these
would<00:02:36.280> always<00:02:36.549> go<00:02:36.760> out<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.299> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
would always go out like that and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.039 
would always go out like that and
wriggle<00:02:38.410> around<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.269> aligned<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
wriggle around I have it aligned in the

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.330 
wriggle around I have it aligned in the
center<00:02:41.410> with<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:43.290> it'll<00:02:44.290> go<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.650> against<00:02:45.190> it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
center with this it'll go up against it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.770 
center with this it'll go up against it
like<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.730> would<00:02:48.880> always<00:02:49.060> want<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.570> go

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
like that but it would always want to go

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.210 
like that but it would always want to go
out<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.590> i<00:02:51.390> would<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.630> this<00:02:53.440> there<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:54.040> keep

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
out so i would have this there to keep

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.430 
out so i would have this there to keep
it<00:02:54.430> from<00:02:54.640> sliding<00:02:54.940> out<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.549> that's<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:58.150> normal

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it from sliding out and that's a normal

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.160 
it from sliding out and that's a normal
blowback<00:02:59.440> mechanism<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.660> connect<00:03:01.930> this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
blowback mechanism you just connect this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.289 
blowback mechanism you just connect this
and<00:03:02.950> then<00:03:03.220> whenever<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.549> pull<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.820> back<00:03:04.000> it

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
and then whenever you pull it back it

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.599 
and then whenever you pull it back it
forces<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> slide<00:03:05.140> back<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.530> then<00:03:08.829> the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
forces the slide back that and then the

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.560 
forces the slide back that and then the
hammer<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.950> pretty<00:03:11.950> simple<00:03:12.250> there's<00:03:12.820> no<00:03:13.120> gears

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
hammer is pretty simple there's no gears

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.790 
hammer is pretty simple there's no gears
or<00:03:13.840> gadgets<00:03:14.320> for<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.040> rubber<00:03:15.160> band<00:03:16.800> it's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
or gadgets for just a rubber band it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.750 
or gadgets for just a rubber band it's
pretty<00:03:18.010> simple<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.620> rubber<00:03:20.830> bands<00:03:21.159> for<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
pretty simple the rubber bands for the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.960 
pretty simple the rubber bands for the
slide<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.340> trigger<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.970> because

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
slide I have on the trigger so because

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.759 
slide I have on the trigger so because
if<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.209> put<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.569> stress<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> slide<00:03:29.470> or

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
if you put the stress on the slide or

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.830 
if you put the stress on the slide or
anything<00:03:30.519> away<00:03:30.819> from<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.209> trigger<00:03:31.450> itself

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
anything away from the trigger itself

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.479 
anything away from the trigger itself
what<00:03:32.830> you're<00:03:33.190> pulling<00:03:33.700> with<00:03:33.849> your<00:03:34.060> finger

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
what you're pulling with your finger

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.070 
what you're pulling with your finger
then<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.819> lug<00:03:37.030> your<00:03:37.269> LEGO<00:03:37.510> pieces<00:03:37.629> will<00:03:38.110> break

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
then the lug your LEGO pieces will break

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.559 
then the lug your LEGO pieces will break
I've<00:03:41.080> never<00:03:41.470> well<00:03:42.129> I<00:03:42.159> have<00:03:42.430> attempted<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.299> do

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
I've never well I have attempted to do

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.479 
I've never well I have attempted to do
it<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:43.989> it's<00:03:44.200> never<00:03:44.530> worked<00:03:44.769> out<00:03:44.950> for<00:03:45.190> me<00:03:45.250> it's

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
it but it's never worked out for me it's

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.890 
it but it's never worked out for me it's
put<00:03:45.670> way<00:03:45.849> too<00:03:45.879> much<00:03:46.030> stress<00:03:46.390> on<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.629> LEGO

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
put way too much stress on the LEGO

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.759 
put way too much stress on the LEGO
pieces<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.340> what<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:49.090> put<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
pieces so what I do is I put all the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.100 
pieces so what I do is I put all the
stress<00:03:50.769> on<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.370> trigger<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.120> does<00:03:52.659> if<00:03:53.080> you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
stress on the trigger and it does if you

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.170 
stress on the trigger and it does if you
can<00:03:53.290> see<00:03:53.379> that<00:03:53.409> there's<00:03:53.709> your<00:03:53.860> own<00:03:53.920> brand<00:03:54.220> it's

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
can see that there's your own brand it's

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.869 
can see that there's your own brand it's
not<00:03:55.269> really<00:03:55.450> stressed<00:03:55.930> it's<00:03:56.140> just<00:03:56.849> how<00:03:57.849> you

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
not really stressed it's just how you

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.449 
not really stressed it's just how you
make<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> really<00:03:58.510> good<00:03:58.680> book<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.830> got<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.159> doesn't

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
make a really good book I got it doesn't

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.059 
make a really good book I got it doesn't
take<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.670> lot<00:04:00.909> to<00:04:01.470> pull<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.650> trigger<00:04:02.680> back

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
take a lot to pull the trigger back

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.070 
take a lot to pull the trigger back
probably<00:04:03.610> like<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.790> one<00:04:04.090> pound<00:04:04.330> trigger<00:04:04.750> pull

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
probably like a one pound trigger pull

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.830 
probably like a one pound trigger pull
maybe<00:04:05.379> two<00:04:05.709> if<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.569> don't<00:04:08.200> know<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:09.340> yeah

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
maybe two if that I don't know but yeah

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.949 
maybe two if that I don't know but yeah
well<00:04:10.840> here's<00:04:11.290> my<00:04:11.530> internal<00:04:12.489> detail<00:04:12.959> this

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
well here's my internal detail this

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.289 
well here's my internal detail this
right<00:04:14.560> here<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.069> justice<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.790> just<00:04:16.120> said

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
right here and I justice I just said

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.409 
right here and I justice I just said
it's<00:04:16.419> like<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:17.190> chamber<00:04:18.190> was<00:04:18.729> around<00:04:19.030> would<00:04:19.239> go

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
it's like a chamber was around would go

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.390 
it's like a chamber was around would go
I<00:04:19.450> guess<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.580> aligned<00:04:21.940> with<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.390> barrel

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
I guess so it's aligned with the barrel

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.850 
I guess so it's aligned with the barrel
here<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.520> is<00:04:24.610> right<00:04:24.640> there<00:04:25.409> it's<00:04:26.409> a<00:04:26.530> line<00:04:26.710> at

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
here it is right there it's a line at

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.060 
here it is right there it's a line at
the<00:04:26.950> barrel<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:28.289> wasn't<00:04:29.289> that<00:04:29.409> hard<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.680> do<00:04:29.860> at

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
the barrel so wasn't that hard to do at

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.960 
the barrel so wasn't that hard to do at
all<00:04:30.159> I<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:31.690> did<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.610> make<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.640> more

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
all I just did just make it more

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.110 
all I just did just make it more
authentic<00:04:35.070> even<00:04:36.070> though<00:04:36.159> it<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.460> let<00:04:36.849> go<00:04:37.000> is

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
authentic even though it is let go is

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.390 
authentic even though it is let go is
how<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.510> get<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.659> plenty<00:04:38.050> with<00:04:38.229> those<00:04:38.409> but

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
how can you get a plenty with those but

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.540 
how can you get a plenty with those but
yeah<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:41.740> really<00:04:41.890> easy<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.190> put<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.430> back

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
yeah so it's really easy to put it back

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.500 
yeah so it's really easy to put it back
on<00:04:42.700> obviously

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.200 

I've<00:04:46.290> never<00:04:46.590> been<00:04:46.830> able<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.190> do<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.460> full<00:04:47.850> slide

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
I've never been able to do a full slide

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.460 
I've never been able to do a full slide
blow<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.230> gun<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.540> entire<00:04:51.780> slide<00:04:52.170> goes

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
blow that gun like the entire slide goes

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.770 
blow that gun like the entire slide goes
back<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:53.040> did<00:04:53.670> once<00:04:54.030> but<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.510> didn't<00:04:54.720> really

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
back I did once but it didn't really

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.810 
back I did once but it didn't really
work<00:04:54.930> out<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.530> well<00:04:55.710> because<00:04:56.010> I<00:04:56.100> had<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.520> put

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
work out that well because I had to put

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.330 
work out that well because I had to put
a<00:04:56.850> lot<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.090> Iran's<00:04:57.540> on<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.920> would<00:04:59.100> break

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
a lot of Iran's on and it would break

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.230 
a lot of Iran's on and it would break
like<00:04:59.640> after<00:05:00.180> every<00:05:00.510> second<00:05:00.930> shot<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:02.340> that's

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
like after every second shot so that's

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.290 
like after every second shot so that's
why<00:05:03.480> I've<00:05:03.600> always<00:05:03.810> done<00:05:04.580> Desert<00:05:05.580> Eagle<00:05:05.760> style

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
why I've always done Desert Eagle style

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.330 
why I've always done Desert Eagle style
slides<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:07.080> my<00:05:07.260> lego<00:05:07.470> guns<00:05:07.740> because<00:05:08.040> they're

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
slides on my lego guns because they're

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.330 
slides on my lego guns because they're
really<00:05:08.580> easy<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:09.060> do<00:05:09.770> Early's<00:05:10.770> for<00:05:11.070> me<00:05:11.190> they

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
really easy to do Early's for me they

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.100 
really easy to do Early's for me they
are<00:05:13.610> yeah<00:05:14.610> i<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:14.760> added<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.510> magazine<00:05:18.110> it's

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
slide lock for this but i didn't i

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.630 
slide lock for this but i didn't i
didn't<00:05:39.900> like<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:40.260> because<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.650> wasn't<00:05:41.040> or<00:05:41.490> not

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
didn't like it because it wasn't or not

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.280 
didn't like it because it wasn't or not
a<00:05:41.670> fake<00:05:41.970> slide<00:05:42.210> like<00:05:42.390> I<00:05:42.420> made<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:42.750> slide<00:05:43.050> lock

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
a fake slide like I made a slide lock

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.310 
a fake slide like I made a slide lock
for<00:05:43.560> this<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:45.000> didn't<00:05:45.330> like<00:05:45.480> it<00:05:45.690> because<00:05:45.900> it

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
for this but I didn't like it because it

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.910 
for this but I didn't like it because it
didn't<00:05:47.280> look<00:05:47.370> like<00:05:47.430> they<00:05:47.820> were<00:05:47.850> real<00:05:48.120> one<00:05:48.920> and

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
didn't look like they were real one and

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.500 
didn't look like they were real one and
it<00:05:50.490> was<00:05:50.730> just<00:05:51.270> too<00:05:52.080> hard<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.620> control<00:05:53.510> because

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
it was just too hard to control because

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.960 
it was just too hard to control because
what<00:05:54.720> I<00:05:54.750> would<00:05:54.930> have<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.200> do<00:05:55.350> is<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.970> mean

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
what I would have to do is I mean

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.120 
what I would have to do is I mean
something<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.540> connects<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:58.020> this<00:05:58.170> where

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
something that connects to this where

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.670 
something that connects to this where
when<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.370> pulled<00:05:59.670> it<00:05:59.820> back<00:06:00.140> well<00:06:01.140> imma<00:06:01.290> left<00:06:01.560> you

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
when I pulled it back well imma left you

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.950 
when I pulled it back well imma left you
so<00:06:01.890> and<00:06:02.400> I<00:06:02.460> pulled<00:06:02.730> it<00:06:02.850> back<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:03.270> would<00:06:03.300> force<00:06:03.780> it

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
so and I pulled it back I would force it

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.440 
so and I pulled it back I would force it
up<00:06:04.050> with<00:06:04.230> my<00:06:04.350> thumb<00:06:04.650> like<00:06:04.920> that<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:06.330> will

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
up with my thumb like that and it will

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.810 
up with my thumb like that and it will
lock<00:06:06.660> this<00:06:06.960> back<00:06:07.290> and<00:06:07.590> then<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.980> would<00:06:08.670> just

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
lock this back and then I would just

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.310 
lock this back and then I would just
flip<00:06:09.150> my<00:06:09.300> thumb<00:06:09.540> down<00:06:09.720> and<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.080> would<00:06:10.170> go

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
flip my thumb down and it would go

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.880 
flip my thumb down and it would go
forward<00:06:10.970> but<00:06:11.970> that's<00:06:12.600> you<00:06:13.350> can<00:06:13.500> also<00:06:13.650> do<00:06:13.860> it

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
forward but that's you can also do it

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.130 
forward but that's you can also do it
just<00:06:14.130> this<00:06:14.280> way<00:06:14.460> you<00:06:14.520> can<00:06:14.760> go<00:06:14.880> like<00:06:15.140> pretend

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
just this way you can go like pretend

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.360 
just this way you can go like pretend
you<00:06:16.230> got<00:06:16.260> side<00:06:16.710> lock<00:06:16.980> reload<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:19.800> max<00:06:20.070> kind<00:06:20.280> of

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
you got side lock reload the max kind of

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.710 
you got side lock reload the max kind of
hard<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.550> pull<00:06:20.790> in<00:06:20.910> now<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:22.050> then<00:06:22.230> just<00:06:22.440> like

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
hard to pull in now and then just like

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.220 
hard to pull in now and then just like
you<00:06:24.720> don't<00:06:25.260> really<00:06:25.470> need<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:26.010> sign<00:06:26.250> up<00:06:27.080> damn<00:06:28.080> it

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
you don't really need to sign up damn it

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:36.040 
you don't really need to sign up damn it
and<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.980> guess<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.370> handles<00:06:29.760> fragile<00:06:30.240> too

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050
