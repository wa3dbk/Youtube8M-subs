piece<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.840> doesn't<00:01:51.870> make<00:01:52.170> any<00:01:52.560> sound<00:01:52.800> at<00:01:52.950> all

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
piece that doesn't make any sound at all

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.580 
piece that doesn't make any sound at all
and<00:01:53.370> it's<00:01:53.880> worked<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.510> platform<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it's worked for this platform that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.420 
and it's worked for this platform that
Izzy's<00:01:55.950> sea<00:01:56.190> up<00:01:56.760> pieces<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.119> plastic<00:01:57.630> wire<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
Izzy's sea up pieces of plastic wire and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
Izzy's sea up pieces of plastic wire and
they<00:01:59.430> amps<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.150> as<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> basically<00:02:04.290> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
they amps way as it so basically this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
they amps way as it so basically this
one<00:02:04.740> doesn't<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.130> very<00:02:05.369> much<00:02:05.580> machinery<00:02:06.060> at

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
one doesn't have very much machinery at

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.029 
one doesn't have very much machinery at
all<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.080> make<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.290> sound<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
all that's what doesn't make a sound and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.460 
all that's what doesn't make a sound and
you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.240> why<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.539> called<00:02:09.750> grass<00:02:10.050> can't

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you can see why it's called grass can't

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.479 
you can see why it's called grass can't
