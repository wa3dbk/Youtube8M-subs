tutorial<00:00:01.979> for<00:00:02.190> overlapping<00:00:02.730> petals<00:00:03.410> this<00:00:04.410> is

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
tutorial for overlapping petals this is

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.650 
tutorial for overlapping petals this is
stitched<00:00:04.799> by<00:00:05.040> first<00:00:05.310> starting<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:06.180> kind<00:00:06.629> of

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
stitched by first starting with kind of

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.640 
stitched by first starting with kind of
a<00:00:06.810> wobbly<00:00:07.410> Wiggly<00:00:07.890> petal<00:00:08.730> shape<00:00:09.530> almost<00:00:10.530> like

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
a wobbly Wiggly petal shape almost like

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.839 
a wobbly Wiggly petal shape almost like
a<00:00:10.710> really<00:00:11.309> Wiggly<00:00:11.969> flat<00:00:12.240> letter<00:00:12.960> M<00:00:13.639> and<00:00:14.639> then

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
a really Wiggly flat letter M and then

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.599 
a really Wiggly flat letter M and then
you're<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> simply<00:00:15.750> echo<00:00:16.139> this

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
you're just going to simply echo this

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.120 
you're just going to simply echo this
repeatedly<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.940> pick<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> pivot<00:00:19.830> point

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
repeatedly and pick really a pivot point

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.279 
repeatedly and pick really a pivot point
that<00:00:20.670> you're<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.150> pivot<00:00:21.359> off<00:00:21.689> off<00:00:21.960> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that you're going to pivot off off and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.970 
that you're going to pivot off off and
this<00:00:23.010> design<00:00:23.220> works<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.980> swirling

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
this design works a lot like swirling

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.849 
this design works a lot like swirling
bananas<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.570> simply<00:00:27.990> stocking<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
bananas so it's simply stocking the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.640 
bananas so it's simply stocking the
shape<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:30.000> pivoting<00:00:30.810> off<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.320> side

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
shape and then pivoting off on one side

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
shape and then pivoting off on one side
of<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.700> swirl<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.600> around<00:00:34.050> your

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
of it just swirl it all around your

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
of it just swirl it all around your
quilting<00:00:34.980> space<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:36.510> does<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.930> together<00:00:37.079> very

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
quilting space it does go together very

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.540 
quilting space it does go together very
very<00:00:37.770> quickly<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.980> tricky<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
very quickly it is a little tricky to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.110 
very quickly it is a little tricky to
wiggle<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.450> around<00:00:42.870> complicated<00:00:43.620> areas<00:00:44.120> but

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
wiggle in around complicated areas but

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.869 
wiggle in around complicated areas but
if<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.809> careful<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.890> big<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> long

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
if you're careful about how big and long

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.709 
if you're careful about how big and long
your<00:00:48.180> m's<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.800> paddles<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
your m's get your paddles get you can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.170 
your m's get your paddles get you can
pretty<00:00:51.899> much<00:00:52.020> put<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.530> around<00:00:52.739> any<00:00:53.460> quilting

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
pretty much put this around any quilting

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
pretty much put this around any quilting
motif<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> any<00:00:55.050> complicated<00:00:55.710> area<00:00:56.070> ran<00:00:56.520> your

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
motif in any complicated area ran your

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.189 
motif in any complicated area ran your
quilt<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:58.350> really<00:00:58.710> has<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> beautiful

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
quilt and it really has a beautiful

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
quilt and it really has a beautiful
swirling<00:01:01.199> texture<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.430> adds<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.539> lot<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
swirling texture that adds a lot of

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800 
swirling texture that adds a lot of
dimension<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.610> quilt<00:01:05.820> top<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
dimension I think to your quilt top it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570 
dimension I think to your quilt top it
is<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.470> something<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.220> little

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
is going to be something that's a little

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
is going to be something that's a little
challenging<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.689> far<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> getting<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
challenging as far as kind of getting a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.000 
challenging as far as kind of getting a
handle<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.580> how<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> pivots<00:01:12.510> around<00:01:13.010> whenever

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
handle on how it pivots around whenever

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
handle on how it pivots around whenever
you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> change<00:01:14.970> direction<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you want to change direction all you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.380 
you want to change direction all you
really<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.250> simply<00:01:17.759> pick<00:01:18.150> an

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
really have to do is just simply pick an

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.010 
really have to do is just simply pick an
end<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.799> pedal<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.540> here

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
end to your pedal point like right here

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
end to your pedal point like right here
and<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.040> kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> recreate<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.180> petal

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and I just kind of recreate the petal

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.950 
and I just kind of recreate the petal
shape<00:01:24.950> not<00:01:25.950> wiggling<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:27.150> over<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> full

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
shape not wiggling back over the full

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
shape not wiggling back over the full
length<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.640> thing<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
length of it the one thing you want to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.880 
length of it the one thing you want to
watch<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.840> ending<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.439> petal

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
watch out for is ending up with petal

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.120 
watch out for is ending up with petal
shapes<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.430> two<00:01:33.060> or<00:01:33.210> three<00:01:33.390> inches<00:01:33.570> long

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
shapes that are two or three inches long

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
shapes that are two or three inches long
that's<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> avoid<00:01:35.729> because<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that's what you want to avoid because it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
that's what you want to avoid because it
can<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.020> long<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> unwieldy<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
can get really long and unwieldy and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
can get really long and unwieldy and
kind<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> control<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.650> also

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
kind of out of control you can also

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
kind of out of control you can also
build<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.369> thread<00:01:41.610> quite<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.479> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
build up thread quite a bit with this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
build up thread quite a bit with this
design<00:01:42.990> especially<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.189> pivot

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
design especially where your pivot

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
design especially where your pivot
points<00:01:44.820> where<00:01:44.970> you're<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.540> back<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
points where you're going back to the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
points where you're going back to the
same<00:01:46.229> spot<00:01:46.439> over<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.040> over<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> over<00:01:47.490> again

and<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.659> watch<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.890> find

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and just watch out for that if you find

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.190 
and just watch out for that if you find
