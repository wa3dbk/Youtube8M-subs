00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

there's<00:00:00.210> certainly<00:00:00.930> one<00:00:01.199> common<00:00:01.620> theme<00:00:01.860> here

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
there's certainly one common theme here

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.849 
there's certainly one common theme here
which<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.790> kind<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.570> greeny<00:00:03.870> yes

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
which is kind of greeny yes

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.730 
which is kind of greeny yes
but<00:00:05.130> I'm<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.520> let<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.060> elaborate<00:00:06.600> on

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
but I'm going to let you elaborate on

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.980 
but I'm going to let you elaborate on
the<00:00:07.740> more<00:00:07.919> subtle<00:00:08.160> theme<00:00:08.580> please<00:00:09.120> okay<00:00:09.809> well

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the more subtle theme please okay well

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.140 
the more subtle theme please okay well
this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.290> all<00:00:10.469> vaseline<00:00:11.190> glass<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.759> call<00:00:12.030> it

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
this is all vaseline glass and I call it

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.110 
this is all vaseline glass and I call it
uranium<00:00:12.660> glass<00:00:12.920> yes<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.250> think<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> coloring

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
uranium glass yes I think the coloring

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
uranium glass yes I think the coloring
is<00:00:15.210> uranium<00:00:15.599> oxide<00:00:15.990> which<00:00:16.650> gives<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.949> this

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is uranium oxide which gives it this

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.340 
is uranium oxide which gives it this
bright<00:00:17.340> yellow<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.940> green<00:00:18.270> coloring<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
bright yellow or the green coloring and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.529 
bright yellow or the green coloring and
that<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.740> absolutely<00:00:20.010> true<00:00:20.369> every<00:00:21.119> single

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that that's absolutely true every single

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
that that's absolutely true every single
glass<00:00:21.810> color<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.439> ever<00:00:22.619> been<00:00:22.830> by<00:00:23.100> made<00:00:23.340> by

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
glass color that's ever been by made by

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
glass color that's ever been by made by
anybody<00:00:24.000> ever<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> history<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> world

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
anybody ever in the history of the world

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.560 
anybody ever in the history of the world
in<00:00:25.890> history<00:00:26.039> glass<00:00:26.369> making<00:00:26.640> that's<00:00:26.910> 5000

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
in history glass making that's 5000

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.050 
in history glass making that's 5000
years<00:00:27.779> every<00:00:28.380> color<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:28.980> been<00:00:29.220> formed<00:00:29.880> based

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
years every color has been formed based

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
years every color has been formed based
on<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> metallic<00:00:30.570> oxide<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> say<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
on a metallic oxide and as you say in

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.049 
on a metallic oxide and as you say in
this<00:00:32.820> case<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.450> uranium<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.850> for<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> long

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
this case it's uranium and for a long

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.410 
this case it's uranium and for a long
time<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.510> until<00:00:36.630> 1944<00:00:37.590> 45<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.030> commonly

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
time up until 1944 45 it was commonly

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
time up until 1944 45 it was commonly
thought<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.870> only<00:00:40.050> thing<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> uranium

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
thought that the only thing that uranium

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.459 
thought that the only thing that uranium
did<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:42.149> color<00:00:42.450> glassware<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> most<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.090> this

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
did was color glassware and most of this

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
did was color glassware and most of this
predates<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.860> discovery<00:00:47.670> however<00:00:48.539> some<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
predates that discovery however some of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010 
predates that discovery however some of
its<00:00:49.110> 70s<00:00:50.100> yeah<00:00:50.399> well<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
its 70s yeah well see it's it's a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.170 
its 70s yeah well see it's it's a
uranium<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.710> guess<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.610> goes<00:00:53.789> without<00:00:54.000> saying

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
uranium I guess it goes without saying

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.470 
uranium I guess it goes without saying
that<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> actually<00:00:55.530> radioactive<00:00:56.460> yeah<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that this is actually radioactive yeah a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.930 
that this is actually radioactive yeah a
bit<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.800> very<00:00:58.829> much<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> way

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
bit not very much it's actually a way

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
bit not very much it's actually a way
that<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:01.199> store<00:01:01.530> radioactive<00:01:02.039> waste

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that they like store radioactive waste

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
that they like store radioactive waste
starters<00:01:02.609> anyway<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> guy

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
starters anyway but if you do a guy

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
starters anyway but if you do a guy
cancer<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> same<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> cup<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
cancer this about the same as a cup of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.830 
cancer this about the same as a cup of
coffee

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
coffee

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
coffee
well<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.409> life<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.770> radio<00:01:08.130> waye<00:01:08.250> yeah<00:01:08.570> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
well like life is radio waye yeah that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.010 
well like life is radio waye yeah that
explains<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.350> drink<00:01:10.560> coffee<00:01:10.700> maybe<00:01:12.020> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
explains I don't drink coffee maybe you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
explains I don't drink coffee maybe you
have<00:01:14.450> antique<00:01:15.450> yep<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.799> than<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> hundred

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
have antique yep more than a hundred

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.200 
have antique yep more than a hundred
years<00:01:17.549> old

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
years old

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
years old
here<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.680> first<00:01:19.860> place<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
here that was your first place this is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
here that was your first place this is
the<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:20.970> thing<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.180> saw<00:01:21.330> yes<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.080> tell<00:01:22.320> what

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the first thing we saw yes so tell what

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.620 
the first thing we saw yes so tell what
was<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> act<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.189> buying<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.509> were

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
was the act of buying what and we were

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
was the act of buying what and we were
an<00:01:24.780> Antiques<00:01:25.170> Fair<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.950> woman<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.340> saying

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
an Antiques Fair and a woman was saying

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609 
an Antiques Fair and a woman was saying
that<00:01:26.790> someone<00:01:27.630> she<00:01:27.750> knew<00:01:27.869> collected<00:01:28.290> Iranian

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that someone she knew collected Iranian

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
that someone she knew collected Iranian
glass<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.189> he<00:01:29.729> spotted<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.540> around<00:01:30.630> at

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
glass and he spotted it going around at

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
glass and he spotted it going around at
sunset<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.890> close<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.490> possible

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
sunset I was close to as possible

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.640 
sunset I was close to as possible
because<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> starts<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> glow<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
because then it starts to glow it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
because then it starts to glow it
slightly<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.700> I'm<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> chemist<00:01:36.329> teacher<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
slightly and I'm a chemist teacher so I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.440 
slightly and I'm a chemist teacher so I
was<00:01:36.960> completely<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.040> sort<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.329> got

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
was completely in sort of that so we got

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
was completely in sort of that so we got
that<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.780> first<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:41.130> picked<00:01:41.369> up

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that bit first and then just picked up

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.069 
that bit first and then just picked up
the<00:01:41.610> rest<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> how<00:01:42.240> many<00:01:42.390> bids<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> got

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the rest and how many bids have you got

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.310 
the rest and how many bids have you got
this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> most<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> no<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.780> totally

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this is most of it no it's not totally

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.499 
this is most of it no it's not totally
not<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> junk<00:01:46.920> no<00:01:47.189> no<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:48.030> we've<00:01:48.119> moved<00:01:48.329> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
not a junk no no I think we've moved on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
not a junk no no I think we've moved on
to<00:01:48.540> other<00:01:48.659> Galilean<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> different<00:01:50.100> College

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
to other Galilean up a different College

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.560 
to other Galilean up a different College
well<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> were<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.090> play<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.420> this

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
well you were going to play with this

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
well you were going to play with this
because<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.560> apply<00:01:53.040> ultraviolet<00:01:53.880> light

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because if you apply ultraviolet light

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
because if you apply ultraviolet light
to<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.659> starts<00:01:55.049> doing<00:01:55.229> some<00:01:55.409> pretty

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
to this it starts doing some pretty

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950 
to this it starts doing some pretty
weird<00:01:55.799> things<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.630> on

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
weird things it was a little actually on

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.649 
weird things it was a little actually on
this<00:01:58.380> bars<00:01:58.680> by<00:01:59.070> gluing<00:01:59.939> quite<00:02:00.119> nicely<00:02:00.329> anyway

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
this bars by gluing quite nicely anyway

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.860 
this bars by gluing quite nicely anyway

there's not tremendous - here but I
would<00:02:35.480> think<00:02:35.630> Lucilla's<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.950> one<00:02:37.160> nearest

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
would think Lucilla's this one nearest

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.680 
would think Lucilla's this one nearest
you<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.620> hundred<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.640> bit<00:02:40.880> that's
