00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
do that but then what happens is you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.639 
do that but then what happens is you
pull<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.770> pin<00:02:04.039> out<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:05.139> then<00:02:06.139> the<00:02:06.319> link<00:02:06.499> will

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
pull that pin out and then the link will

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.109 
pull that pin out and then the link will
come<00:02:06.859> out<00:02:07.009> now<00:02:07.189> there's<00:02:07.399> actually<00:02:07.729> an<00:02:07.819> inner

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
come out now there's actually an inner

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.509 
come out now there's actually an inner
tube<00:02:08.420> where<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.319> pin<00:02:09.649> goes<00:02:09.920> through<00:02:10.280> so

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
tube where that pin goes through so

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.039 
tube where that pin goes through so
don't<00:02:10.759> fucking<00:02:11.209> lose<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.599> or<00:02:11.720> else<00:02:11.840> you'll<00:02:12.019> be

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
tube inside the link there so there's a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.559 
tube inside the link there so there's a
pin

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
pin

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.289 
pin
there's<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.709> tube<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.310> there's<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.940> actual

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
there's the tube and there's the actual

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.039 
there's the tube and there's the actual
links<00:02:25.629> us<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.049> three<00:02:26.319> main<00:02:26.590> components<00:02:27.340> here

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
links us the three main components here

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.899 
links us the three main components here
now<00:02:29.049> once<00:02:29.860> you've<00:02:30.040> removed<00:02:30.250> it

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
off to sound out the fucking the pins to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.259 
off to sound out the fucking the pins to
realize<00:02:40.360> which<00:02:40.629> ones<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:41.079> easier<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.620> remove

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
realize which ones are easier to remove

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.850 
realize which ones are easier to remove
because<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.599> might<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.989> really<00:02:44.349> easy<00:02:44.379> one

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
I put the pin next to it can be an

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.610 
I put the pin next to it can be an
absolute<00:02:47.799> bitch<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.489> remove<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.379> just

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
absolute bitch to remove so I just just

do<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> bit<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.190> prodding<00:02:51.640> before<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.209> you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
do a bit of prodding before you you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.119

decide<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.019> take<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.500> out<00:02:53.650> completely

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
decide to take one out completely

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.009 
decide to take one out completely
because<00:02:54.790> there<00:02:55.239> might<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.420> another<00:02:55.780> link

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
because there might be another link

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.220 
because there might be another link
that's<00:02:56.349> way<00:02:56.590> easier<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:57.190> remove<00:02:57.959> because<00:02:58.959> at

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
that's way easier to remove because at

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.149 
that's way easier to remove because at
the<00:02:59.319> end<00:02:59.349> of<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.590> day<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.799> don't<00:02:59.920> want<00:03:00.099> to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
these pins and that's probably the most

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.490 
these pins and that's probably the most
the<00:03:06.010> most<00:03:06.159> important<00:03:06.790> things<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.299> do<00:03:07.959> there<00:03:08.260> so

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the most important things to do there so

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.949

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
the link out and you can put the the pin

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.869 
the link out and you can put the the pin
back<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:14.470> put<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:14.920> place<00:03:15.190> now<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.549> put

back in to put it in place now to put
the<00:03:16.000> pin<00:03:16.180> back<00:03:16.209> in<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:17.200> may<00:03:17.379> even<00:03:17.739> use<00:03:17.769> a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
the pin back in you may even use a

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.819 
the pin back in you may even use a
little<00:03:18.099> small<00:03:18.760> jeweler's<00:03:19.540> hammer<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.410> tap<00:03:20.650> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
into place and that's basically it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.069 
into place and that's basically it
that's<00:03:23.889> how<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.099> take<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.419> links<00:03:25.720> or<00:03:25.900> you
