00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
then in the second third or fourth

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.210 
then in the second third or fourth
century<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.540> got<00:04:19.690> corrupted<00:04:19.959> with<00:04:20.350> corrupted

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
century it got corrupted with corrupted

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.120 
century it got corrupted with corrupted
with<00:04:21.370> Catholic<00:04:21.940> ideas<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.750> then<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.800> was<00:04:23.950> not

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
with Catholic ideas and then it was not

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.400 
with Catholic ideas and then it was not
until<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.460> 1500s<00:04:25.150> at<00:04:25.479> Martin<00:04:25.780> Luther<00:04:25.810> came<00:04:26.260> on

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
until the 1500s at Martin Luther came on

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.779
