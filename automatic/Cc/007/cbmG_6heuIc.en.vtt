00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
ingenious solution and one that I'm a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.249 
ingenious solution and one that I'm a
big<00:04:40.699> fan<00:04:40.909> of<00:04:40.939> it<00:04:41.750> could<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.169> difference

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
big fan of it could be the difference

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.779 
big fan of it could be the difference
between<00:04:42.680> staying<00:04:43.099> with<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> model<00:04:43.610> like<00:04:43.759> this

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
between staying with a model like this

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.010 
between staying with a model like this
or<00:04:44.180> going<00:04:44.389> up<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.689> a<00:04:44.719> bigger<00:04:44.930> one<00:04:45.460> very<00:04:46.460> clever

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
or going up to a bigger one very clever

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.629 
or going up to a bigger one very clever
now<00:04:48.020> from<00:04:48.199> what<00:04:48.289> I've<00:04:48.409> seen<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.800> 2:01<00:04:49.460> I

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
now from what I've seen of the 2:01 I
