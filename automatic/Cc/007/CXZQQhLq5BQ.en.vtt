dryers anything like that and yeah
there's<00:00:22.009> two<00:00:22.220> different<00:00:22.369> ways<00:00:22.579> that<00:00:22.730> I'm

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
there's two different ways that I'm

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.510 
there's two different ways that I'm
gonna<00:00:22.939> do<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:23.240> also<00:00:23.590> one<00:00:24.590> way<00:00:24.739> is<00:00:24.919> gonna<00:00:25.040> be<00:00:25.130> for

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
gonna do it also one way is gonna be for

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.040 
gonna do it also one way is gonna be for
any<00:00:25.700> length<00:00:25.939> of<00:00:26.119> hair<00:00:26.329> if<00:00:26.480> your<00:00:26.630> hair<00:00:26.660> is

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
any length of hair if your hair is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.440 
any length of hair if your hair is
shorter<00:00:27.890> it<00:00:28.070> obviously<00:00:28.700> it's<00:00:29.000> gonna<00:00:29.119> be<00:00:29.239> hard

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
shorter it obviously it's gonna be hard

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.880 
shorter it obviously it's gonna be hard
to<00:00:29.509> do<00:00:29.720> if<00:00:29.900> your<00:00:30.020> hair<00:00:30.200> is<00:00:30.290> like<00:00:30.439> a<00:00:30.470> nut<00:00:30.649> bulb

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
to do if your hair is like a nut bulb

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.889 
to do if your hair is like a nut bulb
then<00:00:31.520> I<00:00:31.610> wouldn't<00:00:31.910> really<00:00:32.000> recommend<00:00:32.149> either

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
then I wouldn't really recommend either

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.650 
then I wouldn't really recommend either
of<00:00:33.020> these<00:00:33.140> ways<00:00:33.440> but<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:34.340> know<00:00:34.460> like<00:00:34.730> up<00:00:35.450> to

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
of these ways but you know like up to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.630 
of these ways but you know like up to
here<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:35.989> would<00:00:36.110> work<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.250> other<00:00:37.399> way<00:00:37.609> is

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
here it would work and the other way is

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.200 
here it would work and the other way is
for<00:00:38.449> longer<00:00:39.410> hair<00:00:39.769> so<00:00:40.519> I'll<00:00:40.670> start<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.090> with

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
for longer hair so I'll start it with

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.490 
for longer hair so I'll start it with
the<00:00:41.329> one<00:00:41.510> for<00:00:41.930> longer<00:00:42.500> hair

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.639 

and<00:00:47.710> all<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.430> you're<00:00:48.550> going<00:00:48.699> to<00:00:48.730> do<00:00:48.850> first<00:00:49.120> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and all that you're going to do first is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.040 
and all that you're going to do first is
grab<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.680> brush<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.489> just<00:00:51.690> brush<00:00:52.690> out<00:00:53.019> your

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
grab a brush and just brush out your

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.009 
grab a brush and just brush out your
hair<00:00:53.469> and<00:00:53.680> my<00:00:54.309> hair<00:00:54.339> is<00:00:54.579> not<00:00:54.910> in<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.629> waves

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
hair and my hair is not in the waves

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.569 
hair and my hair is not in the waves
right<00:00:56.379> now<00:00:56.589> but<00:00:56.920> I'll<00:00:57.010> try<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.370> find<00:00:57.460> a

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
right now but I'll try and find a

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.610 
right now but I'll try and find a
picture<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:57.969> when<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.420> was<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.870> lace<00:00:59.019> put

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
picture of when it was in the lace put

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.410 
picture of when it was in the lace put
it<00:00:59.739> at<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> end<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.219> video<00:01:00.489> or<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:01.149> picture

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
it at the end of the video or a picture

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.899 
it at the end of the video or a picture
that<00:01:01.870> looks<00:01:02.170> similar<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:03.250> final<00:01:03.610> result

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
that looks similar to the final result

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.590 
that looks similar to the final result
so<00:01:04.509> you're<00:01:04.750> just<00:01:04.839> going<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.110> brush<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.500> out<00:01:05.619> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so you're just going to brush it out and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:02:11.250 
so you're just going to brush it out and
then<00:01:07.600> you're<00:01:08.049> going<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.619> do<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> French<00:01:09.700> braid

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.720 

okay<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:12.320> this<00:02:12.500> first<00:02:12.770> method<00:02:13.070> you're<00:02:13.610> gonna

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
okay so this first method you're gonna

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.080 
okay so this first method you're gonna
want<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.240> on<00:02:14.540> dry<00:02:15.200> hair<00:02:15.470> or<00:02:15.850> slightly<00:02:16.850> damp

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
want to do on dry hair or slightly damp

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.910 
want to do on dry hair or slightly damp
if<00:02:17.300> your<00:02:17.450> hair<00:02:17.630> doesn't<00:02:17.870> hold<00:02:18.320> curl<00:02:18.620> over<00:02:18.710> very

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
if your hair doesn't hold curl over very

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.890 
if your hair doesn't hold curl over very
well<00:02:19.100> but<00:02:19.280> do<00:02:19.490> not<00:02:19.700> do<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.240> wet<00:02:20.870> hair

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
well but do not do it on wet hair

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.540 
well but do not do it on wet hair
because<00:02:21.290> when<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.770> wake<00:02:21.890> up<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> morning

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
because when you wake up in the morning

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.060 
because when you wake up in the morning
it<00:02:22.670> will<00:02:22.820> not<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.390> wavy<00:02:23.780> if<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.290> start<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:24.920> it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
it will not be wavy if you start with it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.120 
it will not be wavy if you start with it
on<00:02:25.580> wet<00:02:25.820> hair<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.260> one<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.710> obviously

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
on wet hair and this one is obviously

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.530 
on wet hair and this one is obviously
for<00:02:28.400> people<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.970> longer<00:02:29.240> hair

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
for people that have a longer hair

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.910 
for people that have a longer hair
because<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.050> your<00:02:30.200> ear<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.380> really<00:02:30.650> short

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
because if your ear is really short

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.700 
because if your ear is really short
won't<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.370> able<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.550> do<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.970> French<00:02:32.210> braid

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
won't be able to do it in a French braid

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.320 
won't be able to do it in a French braid
so<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:34.100> next<00:02:34.370> thing<00:02:34.520> I'm<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.820> do<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.120> if

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
so the next thing I'm going to do is if

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.060 
so the next thing I'm going to do is if
your<00:02:35.480> ends<00:02:35.750> are<00:02:35.810> really<00:02:36.200> really<00:02:36.440> dry<00:02:36.650> mine

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
your ends are really really dry mine

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.950 
your ends are really really dry mine
aren't<00:02:37.310> too<00:02:37.460> bad<00:02:37.670> right<00:02:37.850> now<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:38.660> they<00:02:38.810> are

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
aren't too bad right now but if they are

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.300 
aren't too bad right now but if they are
then<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.410> use<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> regular<00:02:39.890> conditioner

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
then just use the regular conditioner

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.790 
then just use the regular conditioner
the<00:02:40.760> EU<00:02:41.000> than<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> sink<00:02:41.540> I'm<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.530> when<00:02:42.710> you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
the EU than the sink I'm like when you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.740 
the EU than the sink I'm like when you
wash<00:02:43.040> your<00:02:43.070> hair<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.360> probably

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
wash your hair and just get probably

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.410 
wash your hair and just get probably

so<00:04:41.150> just<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.720> would<00:04:41.750> curl<00:04:42.199> your<00:04:42.440> hair

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
so just like you would curl your hair

so just like you would curl your hair
away<00:04:42.949> from<00:04:43.100> your<00:04:43.280> face<00:04:43.430> they're<00:04:43.760> gonna<00:04:43.910> twist

the butt away from your face and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.040 
the butt away from your face and
obviously<00:04:46.820> if<00:04:46.940> you're<00:04:47.120> doing<00:04:47.210> one<00:04:47.539> bun<00:04:47.780> this

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
obviously if you're doing one bun this

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.900 
obviously if you're doing one bun this
doesn't<00:04:48.410> really<00:04:48.560> matter<00:04:48.800> what<00:04:49.100> direction<00:04:49.639> you

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
doesn't really matter what direction you

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.850 
doesn't really matter what direction you
do<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.210> but<00:04:50.720> if<00:04:50.870> you're<00:04:51.020> doing<00:04:51.260> two<00:04:51.470> smaller

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
do it but if you're doing two smaller

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.650 
do it but if you're doing two smaller
buns<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.460> try<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:52.760> twist<00:04:52.910> them<00:04:53.150> each<00:04:53.360> away

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
buns and try and twist them each away

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.980 
buns and try and twist them each away
from<00:04:53.840> your<00:04:53.990> face<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:55.120> then<00:04:56.120> just<00:04:56.419> wrap<00:04:56.690> the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
from your face and then just wrap the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.250 
from your face and then just wrap the
twists<00:04:57.400> around<00:04:58.400> itself<00:04:58.910> so<00:05:02.110> once<00:05:03.110> you've

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
twists around itself so once you've

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.339 
twists around itself so once you've
twisted<00:05:03.500> it<00:05:03.889> you're<00:05:04.340> gonna<00:05:04.460> get<00:05:04.990> bobby<00:05:05.990> pins

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
twisted it you're gonna get bobby pins

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.839 
twisted it you're gonna get bobby pins
don't<00:05:06.650> use<00:05:06.860> on<00:05:06.979> your<00:05:07.070> elastic<00:05:07.550> because<00:05:07.699> it

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
don't use on your elastic because it

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.520 
don't use on your elastic because it
will<00:05:07.940> look<00:05:08.090> really<00:05:08.150> crimpy<00:05:08.930> when<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.199> take<00:05:09.380> it

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
will look really crimpy when you take it

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.189 
will look really crimpy when you take it
out<00:05:09.560> or<00:05:10.250> if<00:05:10.370> you<00:05:10.490> don't<00:05:10.610> have<00:05:10.789> a<00:05:10.970> license

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.839 
out or if you don't have a license
I<00:05:12.260> really<00:05:12.770> really<00:05:12.889> like<00:05:13.190> these<00:05:13.430> things<00:05:13.550> are

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
I really really like these things are

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.930 
I really really like these things are
goody<00:05:14.030> spin<00:05:14.419> pins<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.080> I'll<00:05:15.860> just<00:05:16.099> twist<00:05:16.760> it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
goody spin pins and I'll just twist it

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.620 
goody spin pins and I'll just twist it
into<00:05:17.389> my<00:05:17.510> hair

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.620 

just<00:05:23.320> like<00:05:23.470> that<00:05:23.920> and<00:05:24.010> then<00:05:24.760> I'll<00:05:25.150> go<00:05:25.510> ahead

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
just like that and then I'll go ahead

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.780 
just like that and then I'll go ahead
and<00:05:26.020> spray<00:05:26.410> it<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:29.550> then<00:05:30.550> I'll<00:05:30.670> do

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
and spray it with this and then I'll do

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:56.050

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.280 

okay<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.120> once<00:05:57.450> you<00:05:57.570> have<00:05:57.720> your<00:05:57.840> hair<00:05:58.050> back

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
okay so once you have your hair back

again you're gonna sleep on it just the
same<00:06:00.780> way<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:00.960> would<00:06:01.170> with<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.380> French<00:06:01.620> braid

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
same way you would with the French braid

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.730 
same way you would with the French braid
and<00:06:02.270> of<00:06:03.270> course<00:06:03.540> spray<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:03.930> with<00:06:04.080> this<00:06:04.320> or

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
whatever waves or you do have before you

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.750 
whatever waves or you do have before you

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
go to sleep and then do the exact same

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.670 
go to sleep and then do the exact same
thing<00:06:09.150> that<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.360> take<00:06:09.510> it<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:10.140> results<00:06:10.500> are<00:06:10.590> a

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
thing that you take it the results are a

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.810 
thing that you take it the results are a
little<00:06:10.710> bit<00:06:11.040> different<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.490> braid<00:06:11.670> is

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
little bit different the braid is

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.490 
little bit different the braid is
obviously<00:06:12.210> a<00:06:12.300> little<00:06:12.480> bit<00:06:12.690> more<00:06:12.840> crimpy<00:06:13.260> and

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500

obviously a little bit more crimpy and
the<00:06:14.130> buns<00:06:14.400> are<00:06:14.730> a<00:06:14.760> little<00:06:14.970> bit<00:06:15.180> more<00:06:15.210> curly<00:06:15.930> so

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350
