00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.800 
my attention is back home in Ireland
when<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:16.400> talk<00:01:16.550> about<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.790> tortilla<00:01:17.360> it's

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
when we talk about a tortilla it's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.110 
when we talk about a tortilla it's
usually<00:01:18.409> made<00:01:18.800> of<00:01:18.950> wheat<00:01:19.160> flour<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:19.790> in

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
usually made of wheat flour and in

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.970 
usually made of wheat flour and in
Mexico<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.660> most<00:01:20.840> popular<00:01:21.260> type<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.500> tortilla

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
Mexico the most popular type of tortilla

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.100 
Mexico the most popular type of tortilla
is<00:01:22.160> actually<00:01:22.550> made<00:01:22.670> out<00:01:22.760> of<00:01:22.790> corn<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:23.690> corn<00:01:23.960> in

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
is actually made out of corn so corn in

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.780 
is actually made out of corn so corn in
Mexico<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.650> really<00:01:25.070> important<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.610> would<00:01:25.760> say

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
Mexico is really important I would say

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.300 
Mexico is really important I would say
corn<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.330> almost<00:01:26.570> sacred<00:01:27.110> here<00:01:27.440> in<00:01:27.620> Mexico<00:01:28.070> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
corn is almost sacred here in Mexico and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.310 
corn is almost sacred here in Mexico and
it's<00:01:28.820> nothing<00:01:29.240> like<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.540> sweet<00:01:29.810> corn<00:01:30.050> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it's nothing like the sweet corn the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.770 
it's nothing like the sweet corn the
yellow<00:01:30.620> corn<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.280> we<00:01:31.400> eat<00:01:31.580> at<00:01:31.700> home<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.120> that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
yellow corn that we eat at home and that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.180 
yellow corn that we eat at home and that
they<00:01:32.900> eat<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.200> actually<00:01:33.350> white<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.040> I've

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
they eat is actually white so I've

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.400 
they eat is actually white so I've
realized<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.700> rather<00:01:35.390> than<00:01:35.720> call<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.080> corn

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
realized that rather than call it corn

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.290 
realized that rather than call it corn
what<00:01:36.710> they<00:01:36.830> eat<00:01:37.010> here<00:01:37.220> is<00:01:37.400> probably<00:01:38.150> more

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
what they eat here is probably more

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.630 
what they eat here is probably more
similar<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.750> what<00:01:39.050> we<00:01:39.200> would<00:01:39.350> call<00:01:39.530> maize<00:01:39.890> but

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
similar to what we would call maize but

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.220 
similar to what we would call maize but
I<00:01:40.970> would<00:01:41.450> say<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:41.840> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.050> give

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
I would say that I'm going to give

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.590 
I would say that I'm going to give
another<00:01:42.770> few<00:01:43.400> types<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.760> tacos<00:01:44.150> ago<00:01:44.360> there's

tacos<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.190> week<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.540> there's<00:02:40.750> really

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
tacos this week is that there's really

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.620 
tacos this week is that there's really
is<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> taco<00:02:41.560> for<00:02:41.890> every<00:02:42.340> budget<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.239> started

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
is a taco for every budget so I started

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.390 
is a taco for every budget so I started
off<00:02:43.780> maybe<00:02:44.140> going<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> few<00:02:44.829> places<00:02:45.010> where

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
off maybe going to a few places where

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.220 
off maybe going to a few places where
the<00:02:45.549> tacos<00:02:45.880> were<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> little<00:02:46.420> bit<00:02:46.540> cheaper<00:02:46.930> and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the tacos were a little bit cheaper and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.100 
the tacos were a little bit cheaper and
it<00:02:48.220> all<00:02:48.790> depends<00:02:49.239> really<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.750> filling

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
it all depends really on the filling

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.199 
it all depends really on the filling
that<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.410> go<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.920> some<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.670> them<00:02:51.790> come<00:02:52.000> more

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
that you go for some of them come more

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.660 
that you go for some of them come more
with<00:02:52.329> like<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> stewed<00:02:53.049> meat<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.489> go

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
with like a stewed meat and you can go

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.410 
with like a stewed meat and you can go
for<00:02:54.910> kind<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.599> seafood<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:57.120> shellfish<00:02:58.120> it's

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
for kind of seafood and shellfish it's

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.670 
for kind of seafood and shellfish it's
getting<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.720> little<00:02:58.840> bit<00:02:59.049> more<00:02:59.200> expensive

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
getting a little bit more expensive

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.289 
getting a little bit more expensive
there<00:02:59.859> and<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> last<00:03:00.639> few<00:03:00.790> days<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.150> also

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
there and in the last few days I also

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.789 
there and in the last few days I also
went<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.720> restaurant<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.380> suppose<00:03:02.620> you

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
went to a restaurant that I suppose you

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.979 
went to a restaurant that I suppose you
could<00:03:02.950> consider<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.569> specializes<00:03:04.569> in<00:03:04.600> fine

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
could consider that specializes in fine

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.259 
could consider that specializes in fine
dining<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.650> David<00:03:06.400> had<00:03:06.549> tacos<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.150> menu

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
dining and David had tacos on the menu

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.900 
dining and David had tacos on the menu
so<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.780> course<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.200> had<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.530> try<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:09.400> compare<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so of course I had to try to compare it

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.030 
so of course I had to try to compare it
to<00:03:10.030> my<00:03:10.150> other<00:03:10.299> experiences<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:12.010> was

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
to my other experiences and I was

brought<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.519> most<00:03:12.700> beautiful<00:03:13.269> steak

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
brought out the most beautiful steak

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.599 
brought out the most beautiful steak
cooked<00:03:13.930> over<00:03:14.230> coals<00:03:14.500> slowly<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.280> was<00:03:15.430> so

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
cooked over coals slowly it was so

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.490 
cooked over coals slowly it was so
tender<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.569> was<00:03:16.720> able<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.989> put<00:03:17.139> the<00:03:17.260> steak

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
in my taco and I really didn't expect

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.120 
in my taco and I really didn't expect
that<00:03:19.870> when<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.109> came<00:03:20.319> here<00:03:20.500> everyone<00:03:20.799> keeps

talking<00:03:21.340> about<00:03:21.549> tacos<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.359> fast<00:03:22.660> food<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.319> I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
talking about tacos as fast food and I

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.860 
talking about tacos as fast food and I
suppose<00:03:23.920> when<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.190> associate<00:03:24.639> fast<00:03:25.000> food<00:03:25.329> with

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
suppose when I associate fast food with

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.629 
suppose when I associate fast food with
what<00:03:26.139> we<00:03:26.260> get<00:03:26.440> back<00:03:26.680> home<00:03:26.889> I<00:03:27.069> always<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.549> of

what we get back home I always think of

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.449

I've just been served my tortilla here

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.680 
I've just been served my tortilla here
on<00:04:38.289> a<00:04:38.320> little<00:04:38.620> piece<00:04:38.800> of<00:04:38.949> paper<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:40.389> Mexican

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
on a little piece of paper and a Mexican

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.279 
on a little piece of paper and a Mexican
author<00:04:41.139> famously<00:04:41.860> talked<00:04:42.190> about<00:04:43.110> what<00:04:44.110> might

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
author famously talked about what might

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.080 
author famously talked about what might
have<00:04:44.410> been<00:04:44.560> behind<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.010> creation<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.580> the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
have been behind the creation of the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.090 
have been behind the creation of the
taco<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:47.289> think<00:04:47.500> it's<00:04:47.620> quite<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.770> beautiful

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
taco and I think it's quite a beautiful

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.529 
taco and I think it's quite a beautiful
way<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.430> sum<00:04:48.729> it<00:04:48.760> up<00:04:48.940> he<00:04:49.120> said<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.449> he

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
way to sum it up he said that he

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.540 
way to sum it up he said that he
imagined<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.260> inventor<00:04:50.590> wanted<00:04:51.310> to

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
imagined that the inventor wanted to

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.100 
imagined that the inventor wanted to
create<00:04:51.910> something<00:04:52.210> where<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.690> didn't<00:04:52.990> need

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
create something where you didn't need

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.650 
create something where you didn't need
any<00:04:53.350> knives<00:04:53.650> or<00:04:54.070> Forks<00:04:54.520> he<00:04:54.940> said<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.360> the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
any knives or Forks he said that the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.140 
any knives or Forks he said that the
whole<00:04:55.840> taco<00:04:56.169> would<00:04:56.530> consist<00:04:56.979> of<00:04:57.160> an<00:04:57.340> imaginary

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
whole taco would consist of an imaginary

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.950 
whole taco would consist of an imaginary
spoon<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.990> napkin<00:04:59.860> a<00:05:00.130> tablecloth<00:05:00.960> everything

spoon a napkin a tablecloth everything

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.690 
spoon a napkin a tablecloth everything
that<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.199> really<00:05:02.500> need<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:03.250> don't<00:05:03.490> create

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
that you really need you don't create

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.210 
that you really need you don't create
any<00:05:04.000> waste<00:05:04.330> at<00:05:04.570> all<00:05:04.720> at<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.229> end<00:05:05.380> so<00:05:05.919> I'm

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
any waste at all at the end so I'm

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.580 
any waste at all at the end so I'm
guessing<00:05:06.729> that<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:06.970> eat<00:05:07.389> this<00:05:07.690> taco<00:05:07.930> using<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
guessing that I eat this taco using the

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.620 
guessing that I eat this taco using the
corn<00:05:08.800> tortilla<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.550> with<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.210> little<00:05:10.360> paper

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
corn tortilla and with this little paper

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.510 
corn tortilla and with this little paper
I'm<00:05:10.900> going<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.169> wipe<00:05:11.349> my<00:05:11.380> hands<00:05:11.740> at<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.340> end

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
I'm going to wipe my hands at the end

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.730 
I'm going to wipe my hands at the end
and<00:05:12.880> all<00:05:13.450> I'm<00:05:13.660> leaving<00:05:13.840> really<00:05:14.229> for<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.590> guys

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
and all I'm leaving really for the guys

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.800 
and all I'm leaving really for the guys
to<00:05:15.070> pick<00:05:15.250> up<00:05:15.370> at<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.580> end<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.210> plant<00:05:16.510> and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
to pick up at the end is this plant and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.650 
to pick up at the end is this plant and
so<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.800> think<00:05:17.889> that's<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:19.120> really<00:05:19.360> really

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
so I think that's that's really really

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.210 
so I think that's that's really really
good<00:05:19.930> way<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.139> eat<00:05:20.349> actually<00:05:20.800> I'm<00:05:20.919> getting

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
good way to eat actually I'm getting

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.339 
good way to eat actually I'm getting
used<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.460> eating<00:05:21.639> with<00:05:21.880> my<00:05:22.030> hands<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.479> let's

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
used to eating with my hands so let's

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.900 
used to eating with my hands so let's
give<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.800> go<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:24.010> think<00:05:24.220> I'm<00:05:24.490> going<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.760> add

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
give this a go I think I'm going to add

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.570 
give this a go I think I'm going to add
some<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.330> these<00:05:25.500> many<00:05:26.500> delicious<00:05:26.889> sauces<00:05:27.550> that

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
some of these many delicious sauces that

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.839 
some of these many delicious sauces that
we<00:05:27.849> have<00:05:28.030> here<00:05:28.360> so<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:29.740> think<00:05:30.099> I'll<00:05:30.220> go<00:05:30.340> for<00:05:30.610> the

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
we have here so I think I'll go for the

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.400 
we have here so I think I'll go for the
green<00:05:31.150> one<00:05:31.419> with<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.660> green<00:05:31.870> tomatoes

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
green one with the green tomatoes

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.839 
green one with the green tomatoes
because<00:05:32.770> we<00:05:32.889> don't<00:05:33.039> have<00:05:33.099> those<00:05:33.310> at<00:05:33.520> home<00:05:33.639> and

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
because we don't have those at home and

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.650 
because we don't have those at home and
I<00:05:33.910> think<00:05:33.970> I'd<00:05:34.900> like<00:05:35.139> to<00:05:35.169> try<00:05:35.440> something<00:05:35.500> new<00:05:36.660> so

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
I think I'd like to try something new so
