00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
have the I love you and it has a heart

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.819 
have the I love you and it has a heart
for<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.299> love<00:04:00.510> part<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.709> going

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
for the love part and so I'm just going

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.309 
for the love part and so I'm just going
to<00:04:01.889> tap<00:04:02.100> this<00:04:02.280> black<00:04:02.549> ink<00:04:02.850> right<00:04:03.090> onto<00:04:03.419> there

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
to tap this black ink right onto there

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.539 
to tap this black ink right onto there
and<00:04:04.409> I<00:04:04.560> thought<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.829> black<00:04:05.040> ink<00:04:05.249> would<00:04:05.400> be

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
and I thought the black ink would be

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.369 
and I thought the black ink would be
really<00:04:05.700> nice<00:04:05.969> as<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> contrast<00:04:06.900> against<00:04:07.230> the

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
really nice as a contrast against the

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.379 
really nice as a contrast against the
other<00:04:07.469> bright<00:04:07.709> colors<00:04:08.129> so<00:04:08.879> I'll<00:04:08.969> just<00:04:09.030> kind<00:04:09.269> of

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
other bright colors so I'll just kind of

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.780 
other bright colors so I'll just kind of
stack<00:04:09.719> this<00:04:09.930> up<00:04:10.109> just<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.439> little<00:04:10.590> bit<00:04:10.739> into<00:04:11.670> the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
stack this up just a little bit into the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.089 
stack this up just a little bit into the
green<00:04:12.060> area<00:04:12.389> and<00:04:12.810> make<00:04:13.620> sure<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.799> i<00:04:13.980> have

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
green area and make sure that i have

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.860 
green area and make sure that i have
that<00:04:14.219> lined<00:04:14.459> up<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.939> i<00:04:15.030> am<00:04:15.209> using<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.629> grid

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
that lined up and i am using a grid

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.749 
that lined up and i am using a grid
block<00:04:16.199> so<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.560> helps<00:04:16.949> me<00:04:17.100> with<00:04:17.310> my<00:04:17.340> alignment

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759
