00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.650
 hi girls today i present you look 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.590
 really intense 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.779
 in fact I thought for an evening 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.390
 particular is a smokey on the tones of the 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.850
 purple and blue he made with everyone 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.180
 the products for minerals actually 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.949
 only with two pencils and eye shadows I hope 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.809
 that you like the tutorial and there is 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.800
 useful to pico now the eyeliner run the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.249
 block 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:48.969
 this is a deep blue color 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:53.850
 hairline of the lashes for a long time 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.850
 the eye is the opposite just upward 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.600
 he sees far more precise because 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.600
 now I'm going to fade 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.450
 from the palette shine on I go to get 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.990
 always stage that this deep purple it 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:35.649
 here I apply attachment decides where it is 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:38.170
 already the long pencil I also put underneath 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.890
 and above not to give a nuance 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.890
 begin to fade 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:02.760
 I also bring it in the fold now I go to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.640
 always take the same bread this 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:17.600
 very light pink and I put it inside 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 of the eye and above my nuanced violet 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.980
 and just below the eyebrows 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:36.600
 I intensify the purple a little bit especially 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.600
 the final part 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.070
 now I apply the pencil I found 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.170
 inside the relative who is always round the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.800
 clock but cai place in this case is 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.930
 Violet 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.959
 I remain thinner at first 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.910
 of the eye but I'm not really right 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.450
 at the beginning at the beginning but let's say from life 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.160
 from here on I remain thinner up to 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.709
 this point then up to half 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.490
 in the eye and then the line I make it a 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.490
 little more same 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.070
