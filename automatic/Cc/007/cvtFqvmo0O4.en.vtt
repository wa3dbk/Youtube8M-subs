 There are 7 billion people on Earth. 

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:14.308
 What is the most typical person? 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.999
 The most typical person on earth 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 ... right handed 

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:28.036
 ... earns less than 12 thousand dollars a year 

00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:30.287
 ... he has a mobile phone 

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:33.788

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.725
 Less than 25% of people have a bank account. 

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.801
 So who is he? 

00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:44.191
 He's a man 

00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:47.438
 There are more men in the world than women 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.299
 (though not much) 

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:56.096
 He is about 28 years old (average world sample by age) 

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.098
 The largest ethnic group is the Han Chinese in China 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.209

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.061
 28 year old Chinese 

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.635
 There are more than 9 million such people. 

00:01:13.828 --> 00:01:17.828
 Researchers studied 190 thousand photographs of various people 

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:22.085
 to make an average portrait. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.400
 Here he is - the most typical person 

00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:35.462
 But this person will not be typical for long. 

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:41.910
 By 2030, the most typical person will be an Indian 

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.910

 In parts of Ethiopia, residents consume 2.5 gallons (94.6 liters) of water per day. 

00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:20.950
 Some women spend 8 hours a day to bring water. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 The typical person usually makes the choice 

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:33.740
 But each person makes their choice. 

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:38.430
 What will happen if this choice ... 

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:42.060
 ... multiply by 7 billion? 

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:46.930
