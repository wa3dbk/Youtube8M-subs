this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> little<00:00:02.550> project<00:00:02.790> I've<00:00:03.149> been

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
this is a little project I've been

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.999 
this is a little project I've been
working<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.570> recently<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.990> it's<00:00:04.470> just<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
working on recently and it's just a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.460 
working on recently and it's just a
silly<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:05.640> was<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.819> one-day<00:00:06.150> project<00:00:06.690> thing<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
silly it was a one-day project thing and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.280 
silly it was a one-day project thing and
it<00:00:07.740> was<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.980> create<00:00:08.220> if<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.300> if<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.929> cover<00:00:10.139> this

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
it was to create if you if I cover this

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.320 
it was to create if you if I cover this
up<00:00:10.440> you'll<00:00:10.650> see<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.980> following<00:00:11.460> it's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
up you'll see it following it's

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.470 
up you'll see it following it's
basically<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.019> late<00:00:13.830> strip<00:00:14.820> that's<00:00:15.030> designed

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
basically a late strip that's designed

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.279 
basically a late strip that's designed
to<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:16.260> into<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> bottle<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.430> jar<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.180> turn<00:00:19.140> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
to go into a bottle or jar and turn it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.189 
to go into a bottle or jar and turn it
into<00:00:19.800> an<00:00:20.100> ornamental<00:00:20.730> light<00:00:21.270> source

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
into an ornamental light source

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.950 
into an ornamental light source
it's<00:00:23.010> basically<00:00:23.369> recycling<00:00:24.029> things<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.900> we

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it's basically recycling things that we

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.349 
it's basically recycling things that we
bit<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.369> original<00:00:26.670> design<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.240> put

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
bit and the original design was to put

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.040 
bit and the original design was to put
it<00:00:27.480> into<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> cook

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it into a cook

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.259 
it into a cook
goula<00:00:28.230> bottle<00:00:28.680> small<00:00:29.099> coca-cola<00:00:29.609> bottle<00:00:30.090> but

goula bottle small coca-cola bottle but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.939 
goula bottle small coca-cola bottle but
having<00:00:30.779> said<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.050> I'd<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> actually

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
having said that I'd have to actually

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.229 
having said that I'd have to actually
make<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.189> thinner<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.610> make<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> fit<00:00:33.059> through

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
make it thinner to make it fit through

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.260 
make it thinner to make it fit through
the<00:00:33.390> neck<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.430> there<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> limitation<00:00:36.000> when

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the neck and there is a limitation when

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.299 
the neck and there is a limitation when
you're<00:00:36.390> trying<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> put<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.020> LEDs<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> all

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you're trying to put the LEDs and all

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.940 
you're trying to put the LEDs and all
the<00:00:38.430> sides<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.860> just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the sides of it like this so I'm just

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
the sides of it like this so I'm just
going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> unplug<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.090> does

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
going to unplug this now because it does

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.779 
going to unplug this now because it does
operate<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.600> means<00:00:42.870> voltage<00:00:43.370> means<00:00:44.370> supply

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
operate it means voltage means supply

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.229 
operate it means voltage means supply
down<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> side<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> first

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
down the side so this is the first

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
down the side so this is the first
prototype<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.020> Bilitis<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.920> simple

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
prototype of Bilitis it's very simple

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
prototype of Bilitis it's very simple
it's<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.030> resistive<00:00:51.600> Dropper<00:00:51.989> fact<00:00:52.379> i'll<00:00:52.500> show

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it's a resistive Dropper fact i'll show

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
it's a resistive Dropper fact i'll show
you<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> circuit<00:00:53.129> diagram<00:00:55.070> it's<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.340> four

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you the circuit diagram it's got four

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
you the circuit diagram it's got four
resistors<00:00:57.480> tune<00:00:57.870> series<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.590> each<00:00:58.739> side<00:00:59.070> on

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
resistors tune series on each side on

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
resistors tune series on each side on
live<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> neutral<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
live and neutral and then it's got a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
live and neutral and then it's got a
bridge<00:01:01.350> rectifier<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.190> case<00:01:02.430> I've<00:01:02.609> made

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
bridge rectifier in this case I've made

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.840 
bridge rectifier in this case I've made
a<00:01:02.820> note<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> discrete<00:01:03.809> diodes<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.430> string

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a note of discrete diodes then a string

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
a note of discrete diodes then a string
of<00:01:05.970> LEDs<00:01:06.360> no<00:01:06.689> smoothing<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.350> anything<00:01:07.560> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of LEDs no smoothing or anything that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
of LEDs no smoothing or anything that
just<00:01:07.950> them<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.790> designed<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.720> simple

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just them it's designed to be as simple

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
just them it's designed to be as simple
as<00:01:10.110> possible<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.010> also<00:01:11.250> quite<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.880> power

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
as possible and also quite little power

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
as possible and also quite little power
and<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> maths<00:01:14.220> unless<00:01:15.049> if<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.560> it's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and to do the maths unless if the it's

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.219 
and to do the maths unless if the it's
got<00:01:17.009> 30<00:01:17.280> LEDs<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:20.000> 30<00:01:21.000> LEDs<00:01:21.450> times<00:01:21.930> about

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
got 30 LEDs in it so 30 LEDs times about

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.410 
got 30 LEDs in it so 30 LEDs times about
3<00:01:22.590> volts<00:01:22.619> per<00:01:23.070> LED<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> give<00:01:24.030> 90

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
3 volts per LED is going to give 90

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.499 
3 volts per LED is going to give 90
volts<00:01:24.960> across<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.500> LEDs<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.180> children

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
volts across the LEDs so it's a children

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.120 
volts across the LEDs so it's a children
40<00:01:27.780> volt<00:01:27.930> supply<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> UK

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
40 volt supply here in the UK

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
40 volt supply here in the UK
technically<00:01:29.939> speaking<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.360> 2:30<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
technically speaking it's 2:30 but it is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.390 
technically speaking it's 2:30 but it is
actually<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> 140<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> minus<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.100> 90

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
actually to 140 and so minus the 90

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
actually to 140 and so minus the 90
volts<00:01:37.040> gives<00:01:38.040> us<00:01:38.280> 150<00:01:39.240> volts<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> drop<00:01:39.869> across

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
volts gives us 150 volts to drop across

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.149 
volts gives us 150 volts to drop across
the<00:01:40.350> resistors<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:42.000> resistor<00:01:42.420> value<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.710> 4

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the resistors the resistor value is 4

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
the resistors the resistor value is 4
times<00:01:44.430> 15<00:01:44.909> K<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> give<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
times 15 K so that's going to give a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.270 
times 15 K so that's going to give a
total<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.770> 60<00:01:47.490> kilo<00:01:47.700> ohms<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.530> equals<00:01:50.100> V

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
total of 60 kilo ohms so an I equals V

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.389 
total of 60 kilo ohms so an I equals V
over<00:01:50.520> R<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.030> 150<00:01:51.540> volts<00:01:52.049> divided<00:01:52.590> by<00:01:53.750> 60

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
over R so that's 150 volts divided by 60

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.929 
over R so that's 150 volts divided by 60
thousand<00:01:56.399> ohms<00:01:57.560> equals<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.310> gives<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
thousand ohms equals and that gives a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.719 
thousand ohms equals and that gives a

flat one wanted flash overs and I've

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.240 
flat one wanted flash overs and I've
gone<00:04:02.970> well<00:04:03.299> above<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.230> standard<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
gone well above the standard that the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920 
gone well above the standard that the
certainly<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.940> Chinese<00:04:06.329> brought<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.690> and

certainly the Chinese brought to and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.379 
certainly the Chinese brought to and
then<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:07.739> just<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:08.040> series<00:04:08.340> string<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.060> LEDs

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
then it's just a series string of LEDs

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.030 
then it's just a series string of LEDs
that<00:04:09.510> goes<00:04:09.629> up<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> then<00:04:10.079> turn<00:04:10.530> around<00:04:10.680> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that goes up to then turn around and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.849 
that goes up to then turn around and
goes<00:04:11.220> back<00:04:11.430> down<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:11.879> other<00:04:11.940> end<00:04:12.060> and

it'd make a very good Nate late and I

doesn't quite fit in and I could

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.300 
doesn't quite fit in and I could

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
theoretically make the circuit board

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.110 
theoretically make the circuit board
thinner<00:04:41.690> but<00:04:42.690> there's<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.990> point<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:44.250> think

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
thinner but there's a point that I think

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.970 
thinner but there's a point that I think
could<00:04:45.300> have<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.630> change<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.200> rectifier<00:04:46.620> for<00:04:46.950> a

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
could have to change the rectifier for a

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.430 
could have to change the rectifier for a
little<00:04:47.280> m<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:47.790> or<00:04:48.600> should<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.050> say<00:04:49.170> our<00:04:49.200> dual

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
little m so or should I say our dual

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.950 
little m so or should I say our dual
rectifier<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:51.030> instead<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.600> discrete

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
rectifier and instead of the discrete

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.570 
rectifier and instead of the discrete
ones<00:04:52.140> kind<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.590> prefer<00:04:52.950> using<00:04:53.160> discrete

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
ones kind of prefer using discrete

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.140 
ones kind of prefer using discrete
diodes<00:04:53.970> much<00:04:54.150> easier<00:04:54.420> to<00:04:54.540> get<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:56.150> it

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
diodes much easier to get and and it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.880 
diodes much easier to get and and it
would<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.510> start<00:04:57.750> reducing<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.410> electrical

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
would just start reducing the electrical

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.830 
would just start reducing the electrical
creepage<00:04:59.700> distance<00:05:00.120> as<00:05:00.330> well<00:05:00.480> although<00:05:00.780> I

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
creepage distance as well although I

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.450 
creepage distance as well although I
could<00:05:01.050> actually<00:05:01.200> tear<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:02.070> suppose<00:05:02.310> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
could actually tear it and I suppose the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.490 
could actually tear it and I suppose the
board<00:05:02.670> but<00:05:03.000> then<00:05:03.120> makes<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.660> quite<00:05:03.840> complex<00:05:04.290> to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
board but then makes it quite complex to

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.490 
board but then makes it quite complex to
make<00:05:04.640> but<00:05:05.640> having<00:05:05.850> said<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.600> was<00:05:07.320> a<00:05:07.380> bit

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
make but having said that I was a bit

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.810 
make but having said that I was a bit
disappointed<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.220> couldn't<00:05:08.280> get<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.700> in

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
disappointed that I couldn't get it in

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.450 
disappointed that I couldn't get it in
the<00:05:09.360> neck<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:09.960> standard<00:05:10.440> Pepsi<00:05:10.980> bottles<00:05:11.310> I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
the neck of a standard Pepsi bottles I

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.400 
the neck of a standard Pepsi bottles I
hadn't<00:05:11.760> done<00:05:11.970> my<00:05:12.210> measurements<00:05:12.960> correctly

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
hadn't done my measurements correctly

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.120 
hadn't done my measurements correctly
but<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.580> found<00:05:14.760> another<00:05:15.060> bottle<00:05:15.450> M<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:16.130> which

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
but I found another bottle M and which

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.250 
but I found another bottle M and which
had<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.310> slightly<00:05:17.910> wider<00:05:18.240> cap<00:05:18.600> and<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.080> went

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
had a slightly wider cap and it went

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.370 
had a slightly wider cap and it went
into<00:05:19.440> that<00:05:19.680> no<00:05:19.830> problem<00:05:20.280> but<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.270> know<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:22.020> any

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
into that no problem but you know in any

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.200 
into that no problem but you know in any
form<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.890> could<00:05:23.040> be<00:05:23.130> used<00:05:23.310> in<00:05:23.520> plastic

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
form it could be used in plastic

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.330 
form it could be used in plastic
Tupperware<00:05:24.450> tape<00:05:24.930> jars<00:05:25.260> or<00:05:25.440> containers<00:05:25.890> so<00:05:26.160> M

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
Tupperware tape jars or containers so M

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.520 
Tupperware tape jars or containers so M
yeah<00:05:26.940> it's<00:05:27.300> an<00:05:27.510> interesting<00:05:28.050> way<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.200> make<00:05:28.500> a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
yeah it's an interesting way to make a

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.550 
yeah it's an interesting way to make a
simple<00:05:29.340> light
