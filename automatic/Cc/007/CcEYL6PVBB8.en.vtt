00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
called a lip slide you come up to that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.450 
called a lip slide you come up to that
wake<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> board<00:00:43.680> sideways<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
wake you get the board sideways and the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
wake you get the board sideways and the
fin<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
fin up and out of the water as you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.650 
fin up and out of the water as you
progress<00:00:46.200> here's<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> simplest<00:00:47.850> 180<00:00:48.360> turn

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
progress here's the simplest 180 turn

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
progress here's the simplest 180 turn
out<00:00:48.930> why<00:00:49.200> there's<00:00:49.500> less<00:00:49.739> rope<00:00:50.010> tension

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
out why there's less rope tension

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
out why there's less rope tension
release<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.090> backhand<00:00:51.600> release<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> Finn

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
release that backhand release the Finn

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.590 
release that backhand release the Finn
and<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> come<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.850> same<00:00:54.030> way<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.300> win

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and you come back the same way you win

here's the 13 year old rider showing a
more<00:00:57.120> advanced<00:00:57.480> variation<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> spin<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
more advanced variation of a spin the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.889 
more advanced variation of a spin the
first<00:00:59.100> app<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> same<00:00:59.910> 180<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.690> talked

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
first app is the same 180 we just talked

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
first app is the same 180 we just talked
about<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.410> completion<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> handle

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
about and the completion is a handle

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
about and the completion is a handle
pass<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> complete<00:01:03.809> 360<00:01:04.439> rotation<00:01:04.890> there's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
pass for a complete 360 rotation there's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
pass for a complete 360 rotation there's
one<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:05.970> variation<00:01:06.540> he<00:01:06.659> sets<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
one more variation he sets up with that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.560 
one more variation he sets up with that
handle<00:01:07.680> behind<00:01:07.979> his<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> complete

handle behind his back does the complete
360<00:01:10.260> spin<00:01:10.560> there's<00:01:10.950> tons<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.490> variations

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
360 spin there's tons of variations

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
360 spin there's tons of variations
there's<00:01:12.330> lots<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.810> ways<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.350> fun<00:01:13.430> it's
