things<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:08.049> are<00:01:08.140> gonna<00:01:08.289> go<00:01:08.469> tackling<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
things that are gonna go tackling the

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.310 
things that are gonna go tackling the
graphics<00:01:10.060> are<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> lot<00:01:10.450> better<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.960> this<00:01:11.109> game

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
graphics are a lot better in this game

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.209 
graphics are a lot better in this game
than<00:01:11.560> they<00:01:11.649> are<00:01:11.799> in<00:01:12.509> mo<00:01:13.509> Yang's<00:01:13.810> game<00:01:14.469> catacomb

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
than they are in mo Yang's game catacomb

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.910 
than they are in mo Yang's game catacomb
snatch<00:01:15.609> but<00:01:16.570> i<00:01:16.600> think<00:01:17.020> catacombs<00:01:17.500> snatch<00:01:17.710> is

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
snatch but i think catacombs snatch is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.590 
snatch but i think catacombs snatch is
more<00:01:18.100> fun<00:01:18.369> because<00:01:18.609> you<00:01:18.729> get<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.939> do<00:01:19.270> more

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
more fun because you get to do more

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.810 
more fun because you get to do more
stuff<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.409> just<00:01:20.950> drive<00:01:21.189> around<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.609> train

and shoot you have to like I actually
have<00:01:24.729> strategy<00:01:25.299> involved<00:01:25.780> instead<00:01:26.049> of<00:01:26.170> just

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259

cliff<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.850> sort<00:01:49.149> of<00:01:49.240> got<00:01:49.420> lost<00:01:49.749> and<00:01:50.850> decided<00:01:51.850> to

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
cliff I sort of got lost and decided to

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.690 
cliff I sort of got lost and decided to
go<00:01:52.119> for<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.359> little<00:01:52.659> rail<00:01:52.929> symbol<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:54.549> a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
go for the little rail symbol in a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.499 
go for the little rail symbol in a
corner<00:01:55.119> rail<00:01:55.869> like<00:01:56.520> extra<00:01:57.520> Cardinal<00:01:58.030> but

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
corner rail like extra Cardinal but

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.779 
corner rail like extra Cardinal but
turned<00:01:59.079> out<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.289> was<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.799> a<00:02:00.189> glitch<00:02:00.459> and

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
turned out that was just a glitch and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.520 
turned out that was just a glitch and
it's<00:02:00.969> actually<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.509> opposite<00:02:01.840> direction<00:02:01.990> I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it's actually the opposite direction I

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.709 
it's actually the opposite direction I
figured<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.549> out<00:02:03.579> by<00:02:03.909> turning<00:02:04.209> around<00:02:04.389> and

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
figured that out by turning around and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.050 
figured that out by turning around and
it<00:02:04.840> popped<00:02:05.020> up<00:02:05.429> that<00:02:06.429> was<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.639> bow<00:02:07.110> okay

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
it popped up that was like bow okay

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.790 
it popped up that was like bow okay
so<00:02:11.060> yeah<00:02:11.270> well<00:02:11.600> fire<00:02:11.840> games<00:02:12.170> did<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> really

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
so yeah well fire games did a really

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.100 
so yeah well fire games did a really
good<00:02:12.980> job<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.490> art<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.030> game<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.960> was

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
good job on the art in this game it was

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.560 
good job on the art in this game it was
made<00:02:15.290> using<00:02:15.500> unity<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.330> they<00:02:20.450> had

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
made using unity and I think if they had

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.760 
made using unity and I think if they had
more<00:02:20.750> time<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.260> would<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.470> been<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.590> really

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
more time this would have been a really

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.940 
more time this would have been a really
fun<00:02:21.890> game<00:02:22.400> but<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.900> think<00:02:24.290> they've<00:02:24.470> spent<00:02:24.830> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
fun game but I think they've spent a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.620 
fun game but I think they've spent a
little<00:02:25.100> too<00:02:25.280> much<00:02:25.460> time<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.970> graphics<00:02:26.450> and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
little too much time in the graphics and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.100 
little too much time in the graphics and
not<00:02:26.750> enough<00:02:26.990> time<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.830> game<00:02:28.340> play<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
not enough time on the game play of the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.520 
not enough time on the game play of the
game<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.940> going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> let<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.690> game

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
game so I'm just going to let the game

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:44.290 
game so I'm just going to let the game
play<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:35.090> guys<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:35.630> keep<00:02:35.900> watching
