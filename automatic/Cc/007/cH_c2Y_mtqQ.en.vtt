hallelujah and singing at the same time
specifically<00:00:29.520> just<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> use<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.030> example<00:00:30.360> here

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
specifically just to use an example here

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.060 
specifically just to use an example here
okay<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.149> we're<00:00:33.149> saying<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.559> kind<00:00:35.010> of

recap<00:00:35.660> strumming<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> chord<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
recap strumming the chord on the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950 
recap strumming the chord on the
downbeat<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.430> syllable<00:00:38.999> that<00:00:39.210> were<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
downbeat of the syllable that were that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
downbeat of the syllable that were that
we<00:00:40.079> were<00:00:40.199> going<00:00:40.409> to<00:00:40.530> sing<00:00:40.920> okay<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.850> writing

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we were going to sing okay and writing

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.000 
we were going to sing okay and writing
that<00:00:42.359> out<00:00:42.390> okay

that out okay

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
that out okay
also<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.089> that<00:00:45.179> analogy<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.690> talked<00:00:45.899> about

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
also in that analogy we talked about

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.729 
also in that analogy we talked about
having<00:00:46.679> specific<00:00:46.949> things<00:00:48.140> separated<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.440> any

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
having specific things separated so any

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
having specific things separated so any
hard<00:00:50.339> task<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.179> on<00:00:51.629> guitar<00:00:51.929> or<00:00:52.289> life<00:00:52.530> or

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
hard task this is on guitar or life or

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.399 
hard task this is on guitar or life or
whatever<00:00:53.519> it<00:00:53.819> is<00:00:53.999> a<00:00:54.030> report<00:00:54.899> that's<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.289> in

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
whatever it is a report that's do in

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.709 
whatever it is a report that's do in
school<00:00:55.679> is<00:00:56.159> to<00:00:56.339> break<00:00:56.609> it<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.909> into<00:00:57.179> bite-sized

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
school is to break it up into bite-sized

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.149 
school is to break it up into bite-sized
pieces<00:00:57.749> instead<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.739> looking<00:00:58.979> at<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
pieces instead of just looking at the

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.489 
pieces instead of just looking at the
whole<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.339> like<00:00:59.729> some<00:00:59.969> overwhelming

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
whole thing like some overwhelming

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.959 
whole thing like some overwhelming
whatever<00:01:01.499> that<00:01:01.679> you<00:01:01.769> can't<00:01:01.979> accomplish<00:01:02.219> look

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
whatever that you can't accomplish look

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.880 
whatever that you can't accomplish look
at<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.269> is<00:01:03.389> okay<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.320> tackle<00:01:04.650> this

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
at it is okay I'm just gonna tackle this

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.240 
at it is okay I'm just gonna tackle this
one<00:01:05.070> part<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.690> next<00:01:06.900> part<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.380> Tony

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
one part then do this next part out Tony

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
one part then do this next part out Tony
Robbins<00:01:08.700> calls<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.540> chunking<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.680> think

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
Robbins calls this chunking and I think

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.709 
Robbins calls this chunking and I think
it's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.039> really<00:01:11.340> clever<00:01:11.549> technique<00:01:12.060> he<00:01:12.509> didn't

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
it's a really clever technique he didn't

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's a really clever technique he didn't
invent<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.079> but<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> great<00:01:13.890> technique

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
invent it but it's a great technique

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
invent it but it's a great technique
especially<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.820> music<00:01:15.200> classical<00:01:16.200> musicians

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
especially in music classical musicians

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.130 
especially in music classical musicians
do<00:01:16.829> this<00:01:16.979> too<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.340> they're<00:01:17.430> learning<00:01:17.579> a<00:01:17.759> piece

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
do this too and they're learning a piece

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.920 
do this too and they're learning a piece
to<00:01:19.140> memorize<00:01:19.500> okay<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:23.270> onto<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> next<00:01:24.719> part

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to memorize okay so onto the next part

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
to memorize okay so onto the next part
here<00:01:25.200> we're<00:01:25.380> doing<00:01:25.500> say<00:01:25.770> finger<00:01:26.159> picking<00:01:26.399> for

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
here we're doing say finger picking for

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.730 
here we're doing say finger picking for
this<00:01:26.729> next<00:01:26.939> part<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.420> had<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> people

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this next part I had a lot of people

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
this next part I had a lot of people
that<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> finger<00:01:30.329> picking<00:01:30.539> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that don't want to do finger picking and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.209 
that don't want to do finger picking and
singing<00:01:30.990> something<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.649> this<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> same

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
singing something like this at the same

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.270 
singing something like this at the same
time<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:33.119> they'll<00:01:33.299> come<00:01:33.539> in<00:01:33.899> not<00:01:34.740> having<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
time but they'll come in not having the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
time but they'll come in not having the
finger<00:01:35.579> picking<00:01:35.820> part<00:01:36.179> down<00:01:36.420> well<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:37.109> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
finger picking part down well back to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.139 
finger picking part down well back to
our<00:01:37.320> analogy<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> guy<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.399> tightrope

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
our analogy of the guy on the tightrope

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.230 
our analogy of the guy on the tightrope
why<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.390> juggling<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.039> a<00:01:41.070> unicycle<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
why are juggling and on a unicycle you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
why are juggling and on a unicycle you
can't<00:01:42.719> add<00:01:43.399> another<00:01:44.399> task<00:01:44.840> without<00:01:45.840> mastering

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
can't add another task without mastering

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.870 
can't add another task without mastering
one<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.579> never<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:49.670> see<00:01:50.670> more

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
one you're never going to see more

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
one you're never going to see more
results<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.079> having<00:01:52.289> a<00:01:52.439> hard<00:01:52.649> time

slowing these tunes down that's gonna

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.100 
slowing these tunes down that's gonna
help<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.660> lot<00:02:54.190> especially<00:02:55.420> vocally<00:02:56.420> if<00:02:56.630> there's

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
help a lot especially vocally if there's

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.590 
help a lot especially vocally if there's
a<00:02:57.200> part<00:02:57.560> with<00:02:57.800> say<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> run<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.000> what<00:02:59.570> I

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
a part with say like a run in it what I

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360 
a part with say like a run in it what I
mean<00:02:59.780> by<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> run<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.470> like<00:03:00.710> if<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.010> were<00:03:01.220> to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
mean by a run is like if you were to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.200 
mean by a run is like if you were to
noodle<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.120> few<00:03:02.390> notes<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.410> ah<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.970> sort

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
noodle a few notes you know ah that sort

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.590 
noodle a few notes you know ah that sort
of<00:03:05.270> thing<00:03:05.450> vocally<00:03:06.050> then<00:03:07.360> you're<00:03:08.360> probably

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
of thing vocally then you're probably

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.500 
of thing vocally then you're probably
not<00:03:08.930> gonna<00:03:09.110> do<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.590> very<00:03:09.920> cleanly<00:03:10.400> playing<00:03:11.390> it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
not gonna do it very cleanly playing it

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.770 
not gonna do it very cleanly playing it
fast<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.650> can't<00:03:12.980> do<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.340> cleanly<00:03:13.780> playing

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
fast if you can't do it cleanly playing

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.470 
fast if you can't do it cleanly playing
it<00:03:14.930> slow<00:03:15.320> or<00:03:15.620> singing<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.190> slow<00:03:16.430> same<00:03:17.120> thing<00:03:17.360> is

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
it slow or singing it slow same thing is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.300 
it slow or singing it slow same thing is
true<00:03:17.690> when<00:03:18.170> playing<00:03:18.800> guitar<00:03:21.100> I'll<00:03:22.100> have

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
true when playing guitar I'll have

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.390 
true when playing guitar I'll have
students<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.910> will<00:03:23.030> try<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.510> play<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.500> passage

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400

students that will try to play a passage
very<00:03:26.000> quickly<00:03:27.250> they'll<00:03:28.250> go<00:03:28.400> from<00:03:28.670> playing<00:03:28.880> it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
very quickly they'll go from playing it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.740 
very quickly they'll go from playing it
slow<00:03:29.740> sloppily<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:31.700> trying<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.030> play<00:03:32.210> it<00:03:32.240> fast

slow sloppily to trying to play it fast
cleanly<00:03:33.590> well<00:03:34.420> then<00:03:35.420> take<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.630> rocket

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
cleanly well then take a rocket

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.110 
cleanly well then take a rocket
scientist<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.740> understand<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:37.670> that's<00:03:37.850> not

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
scientist to understand that that's not

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.090 
scientist to understand that that's not
going<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.420> happen<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.410> only<00:03:39.680> way<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.860> play

will<00:04:09.550> you'll<00:04:10.550> build<00:04:10.790> speed<00:04:11.620> naturally<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
will you'll build speed naturally the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.980 
will you'll build speed naturally the
way<00:04:12.980> it's<00:04:13.100> supposed<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.400> be<00:04:13.520> done<00:04:13.670> not<00:04:14.090> forcing

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
way it's supposed to be done not forcing

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.539 
way it's supposed to be done not forcing
it<00:04:15.080> if<00:04:15.200> you're<00:04:15.320> forcing<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.800> it's<00:04:16.160> not<00:04:16.310> going

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
it if you're forcing it it's not going

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.340 
it if you're forcing it it's not going
to<00:04:16.640> happen<00:04:16.790> nearly<00:04:17.239> as<00:04:17.420> quick<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:17.900> if<00:04:18.260> you're

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
to happen nearly as quick is if you're

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.500 
to happen nearly as quick is if you're
just<00:04:18.470> being<00:04:18.770> natural<00:04:19.160> with<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.460> okay<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:19.910> it's

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
just being natural with it okay so it's

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.120 
just being natural with it okay so it's

really about your brain getting this
stuff<00:04:22.550> in<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:23.270> natural<00:04:23.720> way<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.590> what<00:04:24.830> makes

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
stuff in a natural way that's what makes

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.880 
stuff in a natural way that's what makes
things<00:04:25.310> quick<00:04:25.700> okay<00:04:27.820> typing<00:04:28.820> it's<00:04:29.450> not<00:04:29.890> how

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
things quick okay typing it's not how

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.000 
things quick okay typing it's not how
fast<00:04:31.160> your<00:04:31.610> fingers<00:04:31.940> move<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:33.010> how

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
fast your fingers move it's how

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.650 
fast your fingers move it's how
accurately<00:04:34.640> your<00:04:34.760> fingers<00:04:35.060> move<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:35.480> you<00:04:35.570> can

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
accurately your fingers move so you can

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.090 
accurately your fingers move so you can
take<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.870> fastest<00:04:36.320> guitar<00:04:36.620> player<00:04:36.890> in<00:04:37.040> the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
take the fastest guitar player in the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.360 
take the fastest guitar player in the
world<00:04:37.750> yeah<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:39.110> theory<00:04:39.470> their<00:04:39.800> fingers<00:04:40.220> are

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
world yeah in theory their fingers are

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.880 
world yeah in theory their fingers are
going<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.730> move<00:04:40.970> faster<00:04:41.900> but<00:04:42.380> it's<00:04:42.560> not<00:04:42.740> going

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
going to move faster but it's not going

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.310 
going to move faster but it's not going
to<00:04:42.950> be<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.250> much<00:04:43.490> faster<00:04:43.820> what's<00:04:44.780> happening

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
to be that much faster what's happening

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.320 
to be that much faster what's happening
is<00:04:45.500> they're<00:04:45.980> able<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.700> process<00:04:47.090> the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
is they're able to process the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.750 
is they're able to process the
information<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:48.080> lot<00:04:48.260> faster<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.070> they're<00:04:49.520> able

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
information a lot faster so they're able

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.110 
information a lot faster so they're able
to<00:04:49.940> think<00:04:50.900> ahead<00:04:51.070> whereas<00:04:52.070> maybe<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.700> mediocre

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
to think ahead whereas maybe a mediocre

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.950 
to think ahead whereas maybe a mediocre
guitar<00:04:53.600> but

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
guitar but

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.659 
guitar but
maybe<00:04:54.110> thinking<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:54.800> notes<00:04:55.009> ahead<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.370> very

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
maybe thinking for notes ahead a very

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.879 
maybe thinking for notes ahead a very
fast<00:04:55.970> guitar<00:04:56.330> player<00:04:56.600> maybe<00:04:56.810> thinking<00:04:57.259> 20

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
fast guitar player maybe thinking 20

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.249 
fast guitar player maybe thinking 20
notes<00:04:58.069> ahead<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:59.330> be<00:04:59.449> able<00:04:59.569> to<00:04:59.810> see<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.139> in

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
notes ahead and be able to see that in

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.860 
notes ahead and be able to see that in
his<00:05:00.350> mind's<00:05:00.650> eye<00:05:00.889> or<00:05:00.949> in<00:05:01.190> his<00:05:01.310> imagination

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
his mind's eye or in his imagination

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.570 
his mind's eye or in his imagination
much<00:05:02.870> further<00:05:03.139> along<00:05:03.319> and<00:05:03.740> then<00:05:04.069> somebody

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
much further along and then somebody

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
at the same time so if I think of

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.879 
at the same time so if I think of
anything<00:05:41.660> else<00:05:41.900> I'll<00:05:42.169> put<00:05:42.199> up<00:05:42.410> another<00:05:42.680> video

anything else I'll put up another video

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.920 
anything else I'll put up another video
but<00:05:43.160> for<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.400> most<00:05:43.550> part<00:05:43.759> that's<00:05:44.300> those<00:05:44.810> are

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
but for the most part that's those are

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.740 
but for the most part that's those are
the<00:05:44.990> techniques<00:05:45.259> that<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.530> use<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.909> to<00:05:47.599> learn
