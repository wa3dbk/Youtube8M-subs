 Rodrigo were very generous with me 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.220
 because older but I think they said no 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.070
 we are not going to leave it in evidence because 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.770

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.500

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.270

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:21.320

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.320
 shrimp has a clam then it does 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.860
 look like the legs of the tarantula 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.860
 precision 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:37.569
