tabletop lamp or tabletop glassblowing
they<00:03:23.650> call<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:23.920> lampworking<00:03:24.400> because<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
they call it lampworking because the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.270 
they call it lampworking because the
oldest<00:03:25.780> form<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.110> glassmaking<00:03:26.409> is<00:03:26.920> right<00:03:27.099> here

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
oldest form of glassmaking is right here

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.710 
oldest form of glassmaking is right here
on<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.489> lam<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.120> what<00:03:28.239> I'm<00:03:28.330> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.599> is

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
on the lam so what I'm going to do is

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.240 
on the lam so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:28.840> gonna<00:03:28.930> melt<00:03:29.200> some<00:03:29.379> clear<00:03:29.709> glass<00:03:29.980> they

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
I'm gonna melt some clear glass they

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.770 
I'm gonna melt some clear glass they
call<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.519> crystal<00:03:30.879> glass<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.390> I'll<00:03:31.450> just<00:03:31.599> put

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
call it crystal glass and I'll just put

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.940 
call it crystal glass and I'll just put
a<00:03:31.810> little<00:03:31.870> loop<00:03:32.140> on<00:03:32.290> here<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.620> way<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.799> could

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
a little loop on here that way it could

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.559 
a little loop on here that way it could
be<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.069> nice<00:03:33.280> little<00:03:33.489> pendant<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.120> temperature

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
be a nice little pendant the temperature

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.300 
be a nice little pendant the temperature
of<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.780> glass<00:03:35.019> has<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.440> be<00:03:35.530> about<00:03:35.680> 1200

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
of the glass has to be about 1200

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.800 
of the glass has to be about 1200
degrees<00:03:36.579> 500<00:03:37.030> degrees<00:03:37.269> in<00:03:37.420> order<00:03:37.599> for<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
degrees 500 degrees in order for it to

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.690 
degrees 500 degrees in order for it to
bend<00:03:38.140> people<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.980> come<00:03:39.069> in<00:03:39.190> here<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.549> is

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
nice piece beautiful and it deserved a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.760 
nice piece beautiful and it deserved a
background<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.690> designed<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.380> built<00:04:33.500> that

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
background so I designed and built that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.640 
background so I designed and built that
so<00:04:34.640> it's<00:04:34.970> available<00:04:35.270> somebody<00:04:36.260> wants<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.560> buy
