00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.049
 you will never love our love 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.340
 accept 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.270
 a vampire and a strength 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:15.219
 you do not know quickly 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.219
 be immortal and never old 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:27.050
 but my retirement with riester 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 promotion and antwerp are worthwhile 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.879
 the savings age pension plan 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.649
 Giuliano Modica stands next to me 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.960
 sounds really chic Italian the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.239
 sunshine did you bring the sun? 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 or are you not Italian at all ? 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.470
 so I'm argentinian italian wants 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.480
 I was born in Argentina with twelve 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.070
 years to Germany 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.659
 and yes, that was my first job 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 kickers obertshausen then I'm right 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.710
 come to the Offenbacher and I am 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.030
 are glad that the weather is so good 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.670
 also the training conditions better 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.979
 so as Argentine and Italian there 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530
 you can automatically play football on 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.910
 any case sinks or roots and me 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.589
 hope that something can make it out 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 yes, and if you play soccer that well 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.220
 then you must inevitably at the fc 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.200
 st 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 and that's why I'm here and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.149
 Let's see what the season happens 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 already said it was your second time 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.630
 that means you already have my youth 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.940
 played here how long was that with the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
 Master kicked that was at the time 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.619
 At some point of the youth we have one 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 then i played young bundesliga 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.350
 the small jump to the professionals 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 then has a top with 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 trained and then unfortunately I have 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.950
 I was hurt by a ligament tear 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.270
 and you have only one more time 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.759
 In the second team trained and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.130
 From time to time I was up at the first 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.830
 but then I decided to 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.300
 Change because then you say yes 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.550
 little dolls then at the first 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.959
 Team that's why I wanted to briefly 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.780
 away from the city and I'm back now 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.130
 here and I am also very happy 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.720
 right now it's not just of the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.770
 Temperatures hot but you come too 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660
 so sweat pretty much 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 In any case , it was still 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.810
 two and a half hours have been training can 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.399
 tell me where to do sports examination 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.200
 So the last few days have been very tough 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.660
 You also notice the legs but 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.920
 the rain will make it now 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 it slows down from the burden 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.060
 sinks first impression of the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 Team of your teammates very much 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.410
 good impression as I have too much 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.690
 good feeling very little wait that the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.280
 round starts and you will then on the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.480
 field or will you be the first 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 probably take a seat on the bank 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.379
 you feel so much that i think that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.000
 I leave a good impression 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.680
 has the coach but he will then 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.050
 ultimately decide for yourself what was 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.610
 be your position 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.530
 So I think defender have 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 the last games on the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.340
 six played so more of them 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.080
 then right left inside right then 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.000
 if already defensive 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.080
 played midfield but so me 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.319
 personally see me more on the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.690
 Home defense we come to humans 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.890
 giuliano modica what are you doing like you 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.290
 not complete so I closes 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.590
 support the animal welfare are indeed so 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.330
 um that the yes I am very fond of animals 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.260
 I always look forward to it when I come 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.120
 can help a little bit 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.799
 I've obviously tried it now 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.360
 I have to do a door training first 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.220
 Do not take place until autumn 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.569
 that's why you are not afraid even 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.519
 somehow bitten or something like that 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.760
 Frankfurt and otherwise I work below 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.930
 Three goals in the beaver at the rules over 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.280
 from the same a bit surreptitiously 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.250
 So there is that better than 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.269
 here 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.290
 What do you mean but that there you see 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.569
 not really the ice balls 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.069
 draufmachen the sachets or at 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.500
 sunday I have one weekend 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.480
 work on the window and have the cake 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.799
 sold so many points down at the end 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.959
 then google sold again then it works 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.209
 us good or excellent what do you believe 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.769
 because how to give that we can score 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.389
 you do not really say or right 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.739
 So as I said I am very 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.359
 optimistic with the team we 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.700
 We also have a very good feeling 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.049
 and I think we already 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.900
 between the first and the sixth 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.079
 are play your are that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.510
 personal goals in any case very much 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.900
 ambitious therefore very motivated 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.319
 that it starts as hot as fritter fat 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.700
 definitely good on my part 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.139
 something else what the fans know 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.919
 we should know we are allowed 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.139
 need to know 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.919
 Thank you very much for the 2000 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.710
 I have now noticed duration maps 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.750
 should continue to support us 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.639
 In any case, if it goes to the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.360
 come out and play anyway 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.039
 the home games 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.630
 how should we call you best then 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.650
 call to the stadium but modes or 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:41.580
