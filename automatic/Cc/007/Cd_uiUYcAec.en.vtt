00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.970
 continue to run well five years around 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.890

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.620
 Children free of charge the company just does not give an end that means a lot 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.150

 yes that was very funny you 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 they will obviously understand that 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
 What is announced is almost completely withdrawn 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 compromise 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.850
 I want to come now, of course, there are plenty of hotels there 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.850
 us-economy pumps I speak or Mr 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.130
 that can produce 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830
 if that is not enough 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.050
 spd-man activated 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.720
 That's a first try, as I said 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.620
 around with Gaddafi 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.840
 if that is not a question 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 Festivals of Cannes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.860
 we are somebody, too 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 but very low because 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 After that, the Latte is excitedly killed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.470
 Univ-Prof 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.190
 the same does not exist 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.200
 but it would have been more in the game No as far as I told Trittin but 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 late 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.070
 quasi from the own team has got friendships of course can 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.440
 who does the race? 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 I hated it 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.359
 anyway 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.299
 it is the present was a gift 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.299
 Braig percent 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.119
 March effective 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.119
 he then really know I'm trying 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.359
 he is 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.089
 what happened 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.119
 that actually worked very well 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.769
 yes, I had the qualities again 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.769
 outstanding this right also fairly distributed to more 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.799
 Dr 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.929
 RÃ¶ttgen joins the next league game which is actually enough 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.739
 that does not mean that we are not sure 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.739
 Oppel so not something I mean other projects 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.309
 Deadline 2 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.109
 to claim that 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.849
 that comes back again 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.779
 was second fastest 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.019
 if I 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.619
 should exist 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.049
 after a lot 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.679
 this could mean he is and when 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.899
 i often have the strictest support for it-partner 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.899
 Boston is standing 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:30.119
 Today left over continues to pursue 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.399
 should be the case 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:38.469
 so be 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.469
 This commitment is also decent 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 therefore, I'm looking forward to that means percent 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.719
 at the earliest from the second 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:51.559
 No 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.109
 no thanks 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.109
 not to be rare 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.239
 he is 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.499
 it seems to me 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.499
 more since he was a coincidence 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.179
 the liter of juice 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.529
 more 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.239
 the funny then I am that sometime in wars and managers as well as sound hears 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.080
 you do not do at the moment 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
 as a rss feed, so to speak 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.419
 to have nothing to do with having such good grades 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.819
 Ranged around the picture of the situation 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.689
 What does that mean, I'm also very happy 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 Citigroup still at 4 10 m 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.770
 yes Batman Arkham City will be the last 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.770
 around LP St 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.979
 modern 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.889
 box 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.889
 leave more than 1 percent 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.969
 the advantage of the old school 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.569
 No he opened 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.919
 Prof, I want to do it 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.889
 we want to see otherwise no entry 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.939
 Moritz things like that went to hell 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.039
 and Dr who said at the counter video commentary quality 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.059
 500 takes place 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.089
 and yes I would say 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.159
 It makes sense at first
