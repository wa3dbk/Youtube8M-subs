little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:39.810> slow<00:01:40.049> right<00:01:40.079> now<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> seems

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
little bit slow right now so it seems

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
little bit slow right now so it seems
like<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.930> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
like it's a little you know kind of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.780 
like it's a little you know kind of
could<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.500> boring<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.189> anything<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
could be boring or anything like that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.240 
could be boring or anything like that
but<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.380> speed<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:46.890> you're

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
but as you know as we speed up you're

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
but as you know as we speed up you're
gonna<00:01:47.399> start<00:01:47.700> seeing<00:01:47.970> where<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> moves

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
gonna start seeing where the moves

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
gonna start seeing where the moves
actually<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.479> me
