00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
compromises the integrity of it and now

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
compromises the integrity of it and now
what<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.670> pull<00:01:09.299> back<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.890> cloth
