really<00:01:03.210> quickly<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.960> using<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> laser

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
really quickly I was using the laser

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
really quickly I was using the laser
sight<00:01:04.739> long<00:01:05.040> barrel<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.970> lightweight

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
sight long barrel with lightweight

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
sight long barrel with lightweight
scavenger<00:01:06.840> extreme<00:01:07.080> conditioning<00:01:07.470> dexterity

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
scavenger extreme conditioning dexterity

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.929 
scavenger extreme conditioning dexterity
and<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:10.560> my<00:01:10.680> opinion<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.400> need<00:01:11.610> fast

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and in my opinion you do not need fast

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
and in my opinion you do not need fast
manage<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> m1216<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.320> reason<00:01:13.530> why<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
manage to the m1216 the reason why is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.789 
manage to the m1216 the reason why is
because<00:01:14.479> laser<00:01:15.479> sight<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.170> hit<00:01:16.380> fire<00:01:16.590> with

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
because laser sight you do hit fire with

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.760 
because laser sight you do hit fire with
a<00:01:16.830> lot<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> hit<00:01:17.400> fire<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.090> 80s<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a lot you hit fire and then 80s so you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
a lot you hit fire and then 80s so you
the<00:01:20.250> laser<00:01:20.430> sight<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.000> does<00:01:21.150> help<00:01:21.299> out

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the laser sight really does help out

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
the laser sight really does help out
especially<00:01:21.659> trying<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.229> those<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.619> shots

shotgun as well because again these
shotguns<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.689> not<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

much<00:01:55.290> range<00:01:56.299> especially<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
much range especially when you're on a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
much range especially when you're on a

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
against not long range engagements where

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.009 
against not long range engagements where
you're<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.819> going<00:02:23.819> against<00:02:24.120> snipers<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019

when using a shotgun they typically

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.679 
when using a shotgun they typically
don't<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.670> stay<00:02:32.909> in<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:33.239> close<00:02:33.420> quarters

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
don't like to stay in the close quarters

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.140 
don't like to stay in the close quarters
engagements<00:02:34.549> so<00:02:35.549> that's<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.939> little<00:02:36.060> tip

so<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.489> took<00:02:44.579> advantage<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.629> was

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
so I took advantage of that I was

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.300 
so I took advantage of that I was
playing<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.799> of<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.980> guy<00:02:47.129> in<00:02:47.250> this

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
playing with one of the guy in this

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
playing with one of the guy in this
gameplay<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.970> wasn't<00:02:48.269> completely<00:02:48.629> solo

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
gameplay so it wasn't completely solo

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.479 
gameplay so it wasn't completely solo
but<00:02:50.689> the<00:02:51.689> you<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.049> see<00:02:52.230> towards<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.099> here<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.430> a
