00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to purchase this I'm thinking that's a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
to purchase this I'm thinking that's a
mistake<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.610> don't<00:02:11.790> see

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the theme that's what I've been talking

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.460 
the theme that's what I've been talking
about<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.420> every<00:02:30.959> single<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.350> these

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
about this every single one of these

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
about this every single one of these
skins<00:02:31.740> they<00:02:31.980> have<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.490> theme<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> have

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090

to<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:33.840> skin<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> immediately<00:02:35.010> think

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
to see this skin and immediately think

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.850 
to see this skin and immediately think
this<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.300> something<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.320> gonna<00:02:37.650> be

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
this is something that is gonna be

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.620 
this is something that is gonna be
noticeable<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.670> purchase<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.240> spend<00:02:39.480> real

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
noticeable to purchase to spend real

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.300 
noticeable to purchase to spend real
money<00:02:39.660> that's<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.350> way<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> look<00:02:40.860> at<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.040> right

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
money that's the way I look at it right

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.610 
money that's the way I look at it right
and<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:42.090> absolutely<00:02:42.330> falls<00:02:43.170> into<00:02:43.440> this

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
and that absolutely falls into this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.490 
and that absolutely falls into this
domain<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.459> just<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:45.090> nuts<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.750> don't

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
domain it's just really nuts I don't

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.560 
domain it's just really nuts I don't
know<00:02:46.620> what<00:02:46.920> Arthas<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.550> doing<00:02:47.940> he<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.239> just

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
know what Arthas is doing he is just

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.060 
know what Arthas is doing he is just
getting<00:02:48.840> hit<00:02:48.989> really<00:02:49.200> hard<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:49.650> yeah
