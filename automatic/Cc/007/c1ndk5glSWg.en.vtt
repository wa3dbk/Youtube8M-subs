00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.920
 and then we split people there five 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:24.600
 five obstacles that came out of the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 paper ltda 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 dreaming of traveling in what could be 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 This is the first one built here. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.160
 actually this complex network all 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.930
 football here 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:47.070
 this connection at the end of a ramp 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:50.340
 vertical was one of the first 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.860
 Let's see if it works and builds there 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.750
 sure not only works as I will fight 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.750
 a lot of other new teams 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:17.479
 soon in the sequence has a long time 2002 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:20.600
 sees opportunity with your obstacle and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.820
 I imagined connecting the lúmpen with the ramp 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.890
 vertical of a metal bar there then 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.080
 You can make a new one there. 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.080
 looping still has another maneuver here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.729
 the initial idea the first second day 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.520
 idea that was the main one and that 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.640
 knew if it was true was to cut the roof and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.659
 log in using an airmail and ended up 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.659
 also being a suite 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.610
 Funny, I also traveled and it was 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.050
 to be built on the other of the other 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.400
 side was meant to be defron 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.220
 why I ended up having to make 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 subtle was imagined destroyed was not the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.350
 The only way that I came to be able to do 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.350
 a mortal a little less afraid right? 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 I think this was one time I just felt 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.610
 feeling felt going to the next 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.080
 one of the ideas there following the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.830
 other things that happened is the loop 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.830
 screwed 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.940
 the screw man came in actually I went 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.769
 try to do the looping bucket that does not 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.590
 was very successful and I ended up breaking 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.940
 whole were hurt me came the idea 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.110
 A screw I remember I 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 I visualized that 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.250
 I imagined that being possible remembered 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.530
 from that 007 movie that had a guy 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.319
 passing is running with the car and pass 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.989
 a bridge and gives you a screw I imagined 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.989
 that I could do with skateboarding 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.270
 It was one of the very good sensations too. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.130
 that she imagines something and is doing 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.080
 happening is materialized in the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.080
 They are special days special moment 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.440
 evolution is happening you how to be 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.610
 human being learns other things in the 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.460
 My case started to parachute jump. 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.700
 and came the idea of ​​making that leap in the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.700
 grand canyon 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.930
 including the brother is the handrail 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.300
 grand canyon that I brought back here and 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.730
 people put a lot more work 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.520
 were learned it ended up being also 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.690
 once a feeling that would leave me 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.690
 I would do it for a while. 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.540
 one of the most recent ones is actually a 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.160
 obstacle that has given an evolved 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.160
 is not putting the exhaust 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.330
 the difference here is hip hop and you 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.270
 can make fun of the side ramp to 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:50.610
 fourth in the evolution of the obstacle 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:52.950
 The idea of ​​placing a handrail is one of the 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.510
 topics that will continue giving that 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.510
 feeling of joy for a long time 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.710
 That's it, it took time there to follow up. 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.840
 a little bit are not some of the ideas that 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.670
 happened after my life and became 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.380
 want to keep up with a lot of 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.680
 thing happening sign up here I 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.990
 stay here more or less not that you click and 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.220
 sign on skateboard canal life much 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.230
 happening thing let's continue 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.310
 filming bringing maximum to you 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.310
 thanks for the next
