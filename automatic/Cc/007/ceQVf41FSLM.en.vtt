00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.210
 now what gave me a new video this 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.040
 time is how to get off in the elevator of the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 upstream from the roof 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.580
 up to the stream without needing 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 traps or anything like that 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.220
 I also want to thank the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.680
 I learned an encore for the trick he taught me 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.349
 He is good but we need everything is 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.610
 turn on the current and go up in the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.910
 elevator we have to wait for the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.400
 elevator go up all the way like 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.890
 now you see here low and now we have to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.129
 wait for the elevator the elevator 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.720
 rise to the top of everything good in what 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.129
 the trick is the trick 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.440
 put us on the edge between us by the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.890
 elevator shaft and fall inside the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.740
 floor that corresponded to us now you go to 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.320
 see the 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.300
 as I do then it is necessary 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.640
 thank you on this or above all in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 the roof or down the whole I recommend 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 that you do from this floor from 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 above the whole and that the elevator is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.970
 just above you already if you do not have 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.120
 danger of hitting the elevator and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.950
 kill 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.450
 here then now what they kill a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.450
 little bit of zombies for what 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.149
 to spend a little time for the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.729
 lift up to the top and also the 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.469
 trick this trick is from the 8 already you see that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.590
 I've done it by jumping a lot 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.939
 distance and as you see here we have to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.320
 have can be done from one floor in others 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.630
 we put ourselves here we skip explicit 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.520
 towards before and lion room to the vx if it is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.689
 ps3 and when we got down we 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
 we will hook you have to hit the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.960
 just at the time if I had given it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670
 a little before then what has best 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 past what but hooked on the floor 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.119
 up so nobody produces has liked 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.259
 the video x favorites to imagine let's go 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.259
 in the next until the next
