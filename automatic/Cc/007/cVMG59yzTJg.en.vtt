00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850 

once<00:01:23.320> again<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.670> won't<00:01:24.790> get<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.060> chain<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
once again you won't get the chain the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.010 
once again you won't get the chain the
chain<00:01:26.890> is<00:01:27.250> long<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:27.910> have<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.270> twist<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.660> so

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
chain is long so you have to twist it so

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.980 
chain is long so you have to twist it so
it<00:01:29.320> doesn't<00:01:29.560> drag<00:01:29.979> on<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.240> cement<00:01:31.450> when

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
it doesn't drag on to the cement when

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.430 
it doesn't drag on to the cement when
you<00:01:32.110> drive<00:01:32.350> while<00:01:32.890> driving<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.840> can<00:01:37.960> twist<00:01:38.200> as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
you drive while driving you can twist as

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.070 
you drive while driving you can twist as
much<00:01:38.710> as<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.920> want<00:01:39.130> but<00:01:39.430> just<00:01:39.490> make<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:40.080> won't

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
much as you want but just make it won't

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.850 
much as you want but just make it won't
drag<00:01:41.229> on<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.530> ground

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.140 

and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.490> neck<00:01:47.610> until<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.030> go

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
and then you want the neck until you go

00:01:48.150 --> 00:02:13.690 
and then you want the neck until you go
back<00:01:48.180> where<00:01:48.870> have<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.260> hope

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.570 

and<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.850> want<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.210> piece<00:02:16.010> complete<00:02:17.010> facing

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and you want this piece complete facing

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.700 
and you want this piece complete facing
so<00:02:18.420> connect<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.590> is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
so connect like this so this thing is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:38.869 
so connect like this so this thing is
facing<00:02:20.100> down<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.000> way<00:02:21.210> for<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.170> way

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.089 

and<00:02:39.879> now<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:41.110> check<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.470> off<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.920> ground

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
and now the check is off on the ground

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.699 
and now the check is off on the ground
so<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.340> doesn't<00:02:42.700> drag<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:44.230> next<00:02:44.530> thing<00:02:44.620> you

so it doesn't drag the next thing you
want<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.890> do<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:46.450> as<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.690> can
