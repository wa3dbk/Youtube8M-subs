 the strength of our business 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.490
 it is precisely that of producing everything 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.150

 birthday of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.129

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.810

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.810

 a whole line of flavored sugars 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.560
 then we discovered another passion 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.750
 which is precisely the one dedicated to 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.100

 now that we've arrived at this 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.400
