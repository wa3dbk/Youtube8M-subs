00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.309
 so welcome back and today would like 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 I wonder a bit with the question 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.780
 employ or 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.080
 also he said ask where is yours 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.000
 sixpack where your beach figure or too 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.760
 In other words, you are still on the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.130
 right path side still on the way 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.920
 to realize your goals or side 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.630
 from the path packaged come what 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.329
 So it really is, it is now 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.460
 in the meantime , it's six in july 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.649
 at least since then we passed 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 us the new at the beginning of the year 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.100
 we have set our new goal 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.360
 we want to have said okay okay 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 would like to look better this summer or 2014 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 or look better than last year 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 or achieve a certain goal 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.440
 maybe even some were 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.879
 who told her this year 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180
 I definitely my stomach 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.719
 basically clear my abdominal muscles 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.820
 dig out or a few kilos 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.470
 lose or whatever the goals 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.060
 were of course were some since the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.229
 natural I have to say okay 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.520
 start doing something 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.560
 in six months maybe creates 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.729
 nothing great but maybe if 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 I may start now maybe 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.790
 next year my dream body 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.110
 achieved or whatever 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.299
 That's why he would have asked by the question 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 set short time and realize if 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 N24 need last six months is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 just done and it was already 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.299
 Time to ask us how am I on the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.159
 right path I have my goal already 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.840
 I am still reached or nearly reached 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.210
 on the way to achieve this goal 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.549
 or have I left this path and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.490
 soldiers become aware of how fast the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 time passes and I sue at the beginning 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 stands and says if you start today 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.409
 now i have 24 weeks before the year 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.729
 six months already a lot of time and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.759
 if you are just such a two days 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.560
 then you do not think so 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.479
 mega away and suddenly makes schmidt 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.180
 and you realize there are already six 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.430
 months past as lawn past 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 think about where you might fall away 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.930
 I'll say okay to those who say 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 right in the middle of it, I just kind of 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.869
 I lost my own goal 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.300
 left to the room 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.670
 it was too hard or the time was 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.160
 too long no matter what reasons there are now 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.590
 Yes 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.760
 actually passes pretty fast and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.800
 is a bit like that, we are yes 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.989
 people like that a bit 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.970
 Habitats and the beginning is 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.040
 always difficult , especially the first ones 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.230
 two three four steps yes 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.060
 but as soon as you get in once 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.280
 maybe two weeks this whole 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.500
 has been held by so must 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.060
 would become normality but he noted 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.930
 then the next steps fall a lot 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.420
 much easier 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.830
 especially on this way to stay so 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.610
 I have a little thought about it 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.160
 about your goals over how far come 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.920
 ! Yes, but if now right back 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 are they say well ok must be worth of 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.280
 starting over or even another ten 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.440
 step back but still 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.660
 Remember that time usually goes by 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.160
 actually pretty fast yes and you 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.379
 You will notice that you are very often 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.180
 would have said very convinced 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.410
 I's just so persevered until now 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.720
 already the time has passed 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.610
 three four months passed and others 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.379
 are much further than me or I would be 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.790
 now and then if I do not 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.129
 somehow gave up in the middle 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.019
 no matter what the reasons are think 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.239
 any reasons for others 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.739
 they are completely irrelevant but nevertheless 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.510
 do not be on pressure of now 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.819
 umkrempeln yes something past passed 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.359
 Realizes simply time goes by pretty much 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.489
 fast 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.290
 and if he stays on the ball since its on 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.639
 I'm even twice as happy as I am 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.019
 has held on then is actually 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.120
 has passed much faster than he did on 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.700
 beginning thought and since then have your 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.510
 to have results at the end or they 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.060
 to have done 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.299
 okay that was just fine with me 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.299
 soon
