00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
sacked on the other hand was a great

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.560

but pretty average everywhere else I

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.270 
but pretty average everywhere else I
would<00:05:36.810> say<00:05:36.930> he's<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.139> lesser<00:05:37.440> version<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:37.980> John

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
would say he's a lesser version of John

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.520 
would say he's a lesser version of John
Tavares<00:05:38.639> but<00:05:39.300> again<00:05:39.630> he<00:05:39.780> goes<00:05:39.930> for<00:05:40.260> twice<00:05:40.500> as

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
Tavares but again he goes for twice as

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.850 
Tavares but again he goes for twice as

heart<00:05:44.130> is<00:05:44.340> set<00:05:44.370> on<00:05:44.850> getting<00:05:45.360> one<00:05:45.450> of<00:05:45.480> these

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
heart is set on getting one of these

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.800 
heart is set on getting one of these
guys<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.020> I'd<00:05:46.169> say<00:05:46.440> go<00:05:46.770> for<00:05:46.800> Sakic<00:05:47.430> but<00:05:48.060> if<00:05:48.389> you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
guys and I'd say go for Sakic but if you

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.710 
guys and I'd say go for Sakic but if you
can<00:05:49.169> my<00:05:49.830> suggestion<00:05:50.310> would<00:05:50.400> be<00:05:50.460> avoid<00:05:51.030> both<00:05:51.510> of

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
can my suggestion would be avoid both of

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.010 
can my suggestion would be avoid both of
them<00:05:52.070> like<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.190> said<00:05:53.430> there<00:05:53.610> are<00:05:53.639> many<00:05:54.020> current

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
them like I said there are many current

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.050 
them like I said there are many current
NHL<00:05:55.290> players<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:56.070> uh<00:05:56.190> perform<00:05:56.700> them<00:05:56.880> and

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
NHL players that uh perform them and

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.690 
NHL players that uh perform them and
cost<00:05:57.600> less<00:05:57.720> coins<00:05:58.110> so<00:05:58.830> that's<00:05:59.040> that<00:05:59.220> guys<00:05:59.430> now

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
cost less coins so that's that guys now
