00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.720
 a makeup for the night and now they are 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:51.630
 with make up here like me what 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.070
 if you put on your clothes at night the first 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.850
 that super fun because you can play 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.740
 much more with colors the most ideal is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 something more striking than what we use 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.910
 daily in the day although the eye 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.380
 human being tends to be the protagonist of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 almost all the make - up of the 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.450
 So let's apply a makeup that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.730
 smoked flame boys care more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.790
 of makeup that is the makeup that 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.680
 more we can because you throw to the wild cards 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 you have to unjust man power the side 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 mode is a look that usually people 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.290
 think they black but really 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.140
 It's about using eye technique 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.780
 where you focus around the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 strangers and in the darkest part and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 then it fades, making more 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.420
 clear because what it does is highlight 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 very much the look illuminate a little the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:47.030
 shade so that it is not hard is normal 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:49.980
 because I'm going to touch your hair 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 smoky smoky basically 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.060
 It is divided into three parts and you have to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.760
 choose three shadows two men will be 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.410
 one clear one medium and the dark one the 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.540
 medium shade applies them in all your 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.940
 body then the dark shadow the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.950
 use not in the basin as maybe 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.520
 have seen other times but just 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.009
 pegadito to your eyelashes and then 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.019
 use it to present certain parts 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.629
 look maricarmen I will follow your technique 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.370
 baptized the first shadow and I 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.019
 Apply as well as your eyelashes 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.970
 pegadito in the eyelashes and then the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.470
 melt with the base shade to 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.790
 make sure it lasts all night of 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.790
 makeup is good to apply a kind 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.950
 base on your eyelid and use this 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.220
 eyeliner because it will create a texture 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.670
 that will make my shadow set 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:45.120
 what is going to do this with everything for everything 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.120
 that happens up 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.480
 there are those who call 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:06.940
 and if they have to come to us look clear 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.340
 now we are going to move our shoulders 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.230
 with your typical employer and see that this 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.670
 palette has various colors and classes 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.470
 perfect in a color 20 true then 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.629
 get here until you sink your 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.060
 eye now good dark but before 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.549
 doing so can align my eye is going to 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.280
 apply both internally and 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.099
 external of the then we can use 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.780
 this bright black use a brush 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.870
 that is finite to present rest by 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:49.500
 much more 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:49.500
 well we are finishing what is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.530
 they hear us about man who does 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.530
 yes 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.240
 to clean the areas where there is 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.830
 fallen shadow we can use a floor 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.200
 can make this line more decade if you 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.560
 like I like it used thick already 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.560
 we are finishing 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.930
 and of course give mask and use the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.090
 larger than you have in the sense of 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.500
 which has more volume are longer 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.380
 more black 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.350
 if it is a sufficient apply lashes 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.420
 artificial and a support that you can make 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.490
 is to make up your eyes first and then 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.290
 do your doing because when men 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.240
 they are very strong sometimes it can be a 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.250
 little disaster so if you're wrong 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.480
 if you do not have it you are doing it matters but 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.450
 If you make a mistake with makeup base 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.160
 is that it's harder to fix in 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.060
 this makeup today the most important thing 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.060
 is the look 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:02.399
 If I have highlighted the sale, cure is 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.399
 brother of two fear experts we see very
