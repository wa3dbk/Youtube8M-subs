the second and third strings then the it

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.260 
the second and third strings then the it
moves<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.710> little<00:04:59.919> a

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
moves to the little a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.320 
moves to the little a
it's<00:05:01.540> moved<00:05:01.720> over<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.260> string<00:05:02.740> then

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
it's moved over to the a string then

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.129 
it's moved over to the a string then
when<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.389> put<00:05:04.570> your<00:05:04.690> second<00:05:05.020> or<00:05:05.110> third

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
when you put your second or third

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.740 
when you put your second or third

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
fingers down there's no bass note so it

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.600 
fingers down there's no bass note so it
just<00:05:10.930> dies<00:05:11.320> away<00:05:13.710> kind<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.770> muting<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.460> bit

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
just dies away kind of muting it a bit

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.860 
just dies away kind of muting it a bit
with<00:05:15.699> my<00:05:15.820> thumb<00:05:16.120> actually<00:05:16.270> thinking<00:05:16.630> about<00:05:16.720> a

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
with my thumb actually thinking about a

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.040 
with my thumb actually thinking about a
bit<00:05:18.419> then<00:05:19.419> we're<00:05:19.600> back<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:22.360> thumb<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.810> first

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
bit then we're back the thumb and first

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.659
