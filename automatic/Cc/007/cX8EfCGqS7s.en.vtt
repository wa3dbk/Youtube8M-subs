00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.570
 with summer we often multiply 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.860
 long bike rides so obviously 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
 with summer what is happening 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.380
 often found with his helmet very 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.079
 dirty especially by insects by 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.450
 example so you have to take 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.279
 especially care or clean 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.919
 his helmet then thoroughly clean his 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 helmet in full the hull but 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.620
 also the visor so what is it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 do not do not do it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.449
 sometimes use products like that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.129
 here is the glass cleaner that's when 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.319
 not even great to clean his helmet 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.839
 with this and especially the screen the 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.920
 solvent of this product contains 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.749
 products that can be a little 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 aggressive that can degrade a bit 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:58.050
 the anti-scratch characteristics by 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 example of the helmet one does not hit his 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.760
 screen with the very abrasive green part 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.640
 or even some sponge blue 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.620
 it's too much it's too abrasive 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 the screen can pay for it even a screen 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 which elsewhere of course that can scratch even 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 nothing else 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.290
 the classic wipes everything is already 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.770
 sometimes a little too brutal for some 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.250
 screens that are not treated anti scratch 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.110
 in doubt what to use 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.000
 in priority all manufacturers 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.010
 all helmet manufacturers are 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.690
 okay on it we can use a 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.670
 sponge 9 preferably and water 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.040
 soapy warm not too hot 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.580
 you can clean the screen and the headphones 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.760
 with that that is already enough and without 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.200
 at night if you want to go a little bit more 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.640
 away with a little more cleaning 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.540
 complete your helmet there is 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.760
 today different products 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.680
 for example you can clean 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.350
 just the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.430
 the helmet shell with a product like 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.260
 these one sprayed very easy offer 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.080
 then you use either a cloth 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.690
 that you have condemned for this use or 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.150
 a microfiber cloth type with 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.170
 which you will be able to protect the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.750
 helmet he will find are brilliant 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.940
 so this product occurs if allows for 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.250
 clean very very well the case what will 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.140
 find his brilliant and will have a 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.820
 a little anti static effect that goes 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.670
 repel the dust by cons it is 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.680
 perfect for cleaning the helmet screen 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.810
 on the other hand if you use a product 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.340
 like those of this one happens motul 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.989
 which is more versatile it can 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:51.630
 spray everywhere without problems 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:55.500
 we wait a few seconds and always 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.510
 like microfibers and that's it works 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.209
 very very well there we really do not 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 waited a long time and the helmet finds 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.760
 immediately shine without trace 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.480
 and it also works very well for 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.260
 the screen ehsanullah bim port so that's 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.220
 rather a success 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.280
 also pay attention to Lyon's helmets 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.400
 black matte shell for example here see 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.910
 as being a little bit of product hop that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.680
 can possibly leave traces 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.730
 when the helmet dries you can 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.510
 find with traces then that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.530
 depends on the products it is to test on 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.840
 this type of helmet 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.010
 finally a product not very aggressive 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.420
 Fairy style of the house 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.910
 and well in fact it can very well 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.220
 to work and it can give a rendering 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.100
 impeccable and the fairy of the house is not 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.940
 really aggressive for the coop of 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.650
 helmets so it's rather a good plan a 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.310
 point as important is the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.290
 ventilations 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.760
 in fact with the summer we can pick up 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.730
 small insects that they can come to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.160
 put in the vents here and the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.680
 suddenly they can come close 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.870
 the vents and 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.819
 will no longer play their role of 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.530
 ventilation you can take a 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.989
 aerosol type cleaning computers 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.479
 tact 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.500
 that's good cleaning 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:27.389
 airing besides you see see 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.690
 you will see shit goal so you have to 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.120
 well find where the project 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.220
 project the gas and it will allow 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.750
 possibly lead to narration if 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.090
 you really want to clean up 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.720
 Aeration or anti cotton swab products 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.330
 you rub very little part 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.160
 and that's going to make the rations really 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.090
 very clean as new 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.729
 also on many helmets 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.340
 market maintenance whether it's the 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.250
 full face helmets or both midget 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.669
 we can have we can have a screen 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.520
 sun visor so very often this screen 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.470
 sun visor is not treated anti 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.360
 scratch 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.030
 so it still depends on the models of 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.090
 helmets so for the for the clean the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.880
 the better it is of course to dismount it and 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.090
 clean with clear soapy water or 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.430
 with a non- aggressive product like 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.099
 mentioned it earlier and a fabric 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.340
 microfiber that does not lint so 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.500
 to have no trace on those on this 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.500
 sun visor probably the phase the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.550
 more delicate of cleaning the helmet the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.040
 cleaning the 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.170
 double screen pinlock anti-fog screen 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.590
 which is on the main screen 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.180
 so a lot of helmet manufacturers 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.900
 recognize that it is very difficult 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.480
 to clean a pinlock screen 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.580
 without their winger he is not treated 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.190
 anti-scratch and it has a 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.780
 anti fog treatment that actually absorbs 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.290
 humidity so it's very very 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.040
 difficult 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.020
 so we wash it with clear water or 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.460
 slightly soapy not very hot 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.970
 because we must not degrade the 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.090
 seal that is very sensitive to heat 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.870
 is a micro fiber type fabric we are going 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.880
 practice we will try by 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.260
 circular motions and that's up 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.330
 what there are no more traces but in 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.010
 being careful that he is not there 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.840
 stripes it's really very delicate 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.370
 if you can not do it with that product 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.610
 scratches anyway you will be 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.670
 obliged to change your driver for 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.160
 complete a perfect cleaning of your 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.830
 favorite headphones and of course you also have to 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.920
 think about cleaning the inside of the helmet 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.300
 so a lot of headphones on the market 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.510
 has a removable interior 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.210
 undo all the interior trim 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:55.420
 you can put it in the machine rather 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.750
 on a fragile cleaning mode for 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:01.600
 fragile tissues and then leave 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.720
 to dry the interior trim so 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.320
 natural outdoor in a medium to 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.690
 wander no drying in the dryer 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.060
 because it's a bit too radical it 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.890
 will go a little destroy and fiber if ever 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.710
 you are in a hurry and can not 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:20.170
 no time to completely clean 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.060
 other cases could not clean it up in 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.220
 using a first of the kind that goes 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.670
 to spray the inside of the helmet that 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.230
 will destroy the smells and already it will be 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.010
 already not bad you'll find some 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.130
 comfort on the road in town or in any 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.130
 ground
