00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.870
 hello very good everyone here we are in 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:10.660
 a new video today we are going to do the 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:16.029
 video of the promotional envelopes 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:19.750
 that of the game reserve that I did and 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.090
 the sas a ticket because it is a ticket 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.920
 as you can see here this is from 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 possessor of the season ticket 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.840
 and well let's proceed to open the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.940
 fast videos because normally what 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.610
 it comes out is pretty bad maybe today what 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.850
 I record something good, I do not know if there will be 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.850
 luck 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.630
 jump and 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.040
 well I said it 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.040
 an mc mcd 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.040
 one silver fight pretty 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.040
 pretty rhythm we'll keep it 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.920
 this is not sold 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.600
 contracts as always 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.600
 always always always know contracts 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.530
 we will send it to the change deck for 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.530
 sell them 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.290
 we will put a quick auction 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.650
 she is fine 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.500
 532 training a lot of people use it 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.210
 but I've tried to sell some and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.710
 I have never sold 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.150
 therefore I discard it 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 we open another envelope more 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.660
 good good good neither unique nor nothing 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.520
 they have simply come out players in a 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.320
 about gold that two players come out of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.780
 pretty sad silver but good so be it 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 always so nice 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.000
 we will look to make changes the contracts 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.000
 I will sell them 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.920
 let's see let's see it 's all I have 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.920
 we discard everything 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.090
 and good since nothing has come out 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.090
 we will open a small envelope of gold 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.030
 with coins 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.030
 or if there is luck 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 and well, there has not been much luck 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.620
 tulio de melo 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.180
 to whom it is great thing had you can 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.109
 be 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.109
 you can sell 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.940
 and many more contracts are still thinking 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.940
 in contracts 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.760
 we send them to the change deck 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:55.300
 with a morale to the club and well this has 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.600
 been a whole video with the envelopes that 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.230
 give to her so you can see that she does not 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.880
 gives nothing of the other world and good if you 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.160

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.810
