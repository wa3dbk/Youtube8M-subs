 this because to realize these two 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.579
 techniques we will not use products and gods 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 make up specific but we're going to use 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.079
 of commonly available elements 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.710

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.080
 instead of hair products you can 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.479
 use glue stick but make sure 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.280
 that the product is to bossico between the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.259
 boron I remove the figure I recommend the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.509
 figure because it is less consistency 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.190
 powdery talc and therefore reduces 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.530
 the possibility of lumps forming 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.720
 with my product wet first 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.240
 their root 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.250
 the purpose of this passage that goes 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.869
 repeated several times depending on how much 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.819
