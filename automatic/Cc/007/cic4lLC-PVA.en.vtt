00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hello Natalia Trovich with you and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.430
 today we will talk about how 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.980
 crop image or otherwise 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.320
 resize it ie trim 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 too much or again change the size in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.619
 pixels 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.560
 in order to insert in some place 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.189
 in a specific format specific 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 the size of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 what do we need for that let's 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:39.019
 let's see I prepared the image 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 we will open it now 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:47.699
 click ok here is an image for example 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.609
 we only need to display these 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.460
 we donâ€™t need this background 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:56.359
 there is such a framing tool here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.999
 he is also called by the letter s 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:07.080
 English select and select the place 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:10.700
 which we need to leave here we are 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.700
 We can resize 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.750
 adjust as we need to leave 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:26.180
 and press enter on the keyboard all 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.260
 reduced now we need let's say 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.480
 certain size set this 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.580
 images so she got into some 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:40.320
 boundaries how to do it if you have 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.820
 version with and above then you need to grab 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 here is the left button here for this name and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.790
 pull down to image like 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 here it is a page she separated 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.970
 all she separated now for this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.390
 right click on the field 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.050
 choose the size of the image comes out here 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.260
 this is the menu where we can change 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.260
 the size 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.610
 if you are preparing an image for 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.210
 the internet till we are considering for 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470
 Internet then change the size and here 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.470
 again if you need to save 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.980
 proportions don't forget on 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.590
 live this tick on we change 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.340
 again here we can percentage and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.210
 pixels recommend pixels for example us 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.460
 need size 300 as you see if you 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.330
 tick keep proportions then 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.940
 you don't even have to force the bottom one 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.060
 if the image is different watch 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.170
 for the Internet should be 72 resolution 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.400
 pixels per inch 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.550
 that is, these are all 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.200
 press ok 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.830
 I highly recommend saving 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.760
 don't just save for both the internet 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:07.220
 save in another way before save 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:12.140
 for web and devices click opens 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.260
 window in which we can choose in which 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:20.320
 format we save it yes for example 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.320
 jeep we choose quality 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.260
 we can save can leave so 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.720
 as we have by default can this 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.560
 size is reduced depending on why we need it 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.880
 need and is critical for us, well, I will say 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.570
 so for sites 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.570
 the smaller the size of the pictures and the faster 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.760
 the page will be loaded accordingly 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.950
 principle we can reduce the course here 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.110
 move the cursor here and see how much 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.040
 image will change to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.980
 monitor if the image does not change 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:02.290
 critical it is possible to reduce we maximize 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.290
 let's say like this save 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:11.810
 can we call it somehow differently 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.820
 Yes, and we say save all our 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.700
 Images 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.979
 preserved very different form on this 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.979
 All with you was Natalia Trovich
