00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
then on the back I usually put a black

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
then on the back I usually put a black
flat<00:01:22.110> paint<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.640> even<00:01:23.729> further

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
flat paint just to see like even further

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
flat paint just to see like even further
since<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.900> wood<00:01:25.220> about<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.970> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
since it's all wood about this what I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
since it's all wood about this what I
have<00:01:27.210> under<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.799> could<00:01:28.950> find<00:01:29.220> at

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
have under here this you could find at

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.149 
have under here this you could find at
any<00:01:30.299> hardware<00:01:30.600> store<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.380> what's<00:01:31.950> neat<00:01:32.130> about

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
any hardware store and what's neat about

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.910 
any hardware store and what's neat about
it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.509> keeps<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.380> canvas<00:01:34.770> or

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it is that it keeps the canvas or

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.410 
it is that it keeps the canvas or
whatever<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.310> working<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:35.909> slipping

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
one and so just I can't elevate the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.899 
one and so just I can't elevate the
painting<00:01:43.439> since<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.710> worked<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.070> close<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.610> next

pencil or a pen maybe even a different
color<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.350> just<00:03:08.590> trace<00:03:08.799> over<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
color and you can just trace over the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.300 
color and you can just trace over the
drawing<00:03:09.430> being<00:03:09.970> real<00:03:10.180> accurate<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.019> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
drawing being real accurate about it and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.370 
drawing being real accurate about it and
get<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.430> back<00:03:12.609> on<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.850> canvas<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.900> basically

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
get it back on the canvas so basically

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.509 
get it back on the canvas so basically
that's<00:03:14.590> how<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:14.950> starts

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
that's how it starts

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.880 
that's how it starts

maybe<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:54.269> what<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.420> neat<00:03:55.630> about<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:55.989> like

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
maybe and what is neat about it is like

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.020 
maybe and what is neat about it is like
you<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.590> clean<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.130> sponge<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.579> put<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:57.850> little

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
you you clean the sponge I put a little

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.240 
you you clean the sponge I put a little
bit<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.299> ammonia<00:03:58.600> in<00:03:59.079> there<00:03:59.410> when<00:03:59.859> I<00:03:59.889> wash<00:04:00.220> it

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
bit of ammonia in there when I wash it

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.180 
bit of ammonia in there when I wash it
so<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.850> kills<00:04:01.060> what<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> bacteria<00:04:01.980> happens<00:04:02.980> it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
so it kills what a bacteria happens it

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.490
