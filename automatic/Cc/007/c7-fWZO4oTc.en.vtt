 new Hyundai Santa Fe whose image 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.970
 changed dramatically with the change

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.930
 made in the style of others about European

 models hyundai in which Koreans 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.460
 gradually moving away from excessive 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.950
 a riot of forms as opposed to 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.630
 kia design concern in hyundai design 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.730
 Asian motives are still 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.190
 are present but they are exactly as many as 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.809
 necessary for stylistic binding 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.270
 new crossover to other brand models 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.950
 and in order to emphasize 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.070
 individuality and novelty santa fe and 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.090
 third generation correct proportions 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.519
 dynamic profile carefully 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.530
 elaborated design elements all this 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.449
 moved santa fe to another level 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.730
 turning it out in a generally a 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.890
 nondescript family car stylish 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.629
 attention-getting crossover which 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.260
 besides they almost lost in 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.260
 practicality 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.190
 Part of the interior design Koreans 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.130
 already confidently playing on the field leading 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.780
 European and Japanese manufacturers on 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.820
 our test went very well 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.430
 staffed but still they are 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.220
 a rich version of an excelent from the first 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.240
 look at the brown beige interior 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.870
 traditionally daring designer 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.080
 registration 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.640
 the word premium comes to mind is unusual 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.890
 perforation on leather seats 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.410
 front trim imitating the look 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.170
 Japanese paper washi nice looking 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.180
 small details unusual at the same time quite 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.400
 functional and high quality 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.979
 there is a feeling that the new santa fe 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.030
 offers for its price much more 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.880
 what do you expect 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.550
 Is it more of course at its cost? 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 santa fe is far from a premium crossover but to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.420
 Korean designers with their 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.850
 the work they did perfectly well 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.040
 need to underline what you need to hide 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 for example, you don't notice pretty go 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.729
 hard plastic from which made 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.560
 registration of the lower perimeter of the cabin 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.080
 Give slavuta bright blue lights 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 center console in such an entourage is not 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.280
 annoying given how 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.750
 persistence of Hyundai and and transfers from 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.150
 one model to another for three 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.630
 features of the brand seems to have 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.459
 get used to the rest salon santa fe 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.230
 really nice beautiful optitron and 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.480
 and super vision devices with detailed 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.580
 traced graphics nice looking and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.620
 the feel of the material 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.170
 premiums are also facilitated by a button 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.239
 engine start and electronic key 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.640
 parking brake and underride 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.500
 systems it has a color touchscreen display 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.040
 image is output from the rear camera 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.170
 kind of 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.510
 of course by modern standards its size 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.850
 not so impressive in the top version 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 replaced by an 8 inch screen with 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.390
 navigation system 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.070
 besides this the most manned 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.310
 santa fe fuel version 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.650
 long equipment list add 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.140
 c panoramic roof rear heated 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.180
 seats curtains on the rear side windows and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.580
 premium audio system 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.480
 but without this interior santa fe 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.530
 feels pretty expensive 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.690
 mod that beauty is important 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.030
 here do not conflict with 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.519
 functionality ergonomics without 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.890
 complaints of the seat is very comfortable 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.780
 pleases in tenacious upholstery and beautiful 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.640
 profiles for services to drivers 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.560
 power windows with automatic 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.810
 mode 2-zone climate control with 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.450
 air ionizer tanks for 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.880
 cooling drinks rear seats too 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.709
 comfortable equipped with adjustable backrest 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.590
 cannot move longitudinally 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.540
 direction still diesel version 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.489
 the disadvantage of which is slow 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.269
 warming up is equipped with an additional 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.269
 heater 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.349
 despite being more sporty and 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.750
 dynamic image tuning suspension and 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.030
 character nabil generally shifted to 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.400
 side comfort even on large 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.140
 18 inch drive suspension not 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.180
 annoyed by extraneous noises and 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.010
 confidently copes with the broken 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.109
 asphalt with the character itself 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.870
 manageability, though not sporty 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.239
 but quite passenger from driving santa to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.160
 perceived not as a crossover but as 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.040
 big wagon with all the softness 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.590
 suspension rolls are small and the reaction to 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.440
 Steering is sharp and adequate . 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.489
 comes immediately 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.630
 electric power steering performance 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.450
 can change 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.930
 using system flex steer mode 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.580
 sport 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.050
 of manual shift mode 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.260
 gears to minimize 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.229
 delays 6 speed santa machine 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.340
 fe, even though kindle spurs 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.290
 optimal for this machine 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.780
 like mode norm since from 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.000
 1800 kilogram crossover with 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.790
 gasoline four volume 24 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.169
 don't wait for hurricanes speakers under 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.510
 the hood of this car 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.440
 200 would look much more appropriate 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.540
 strong turbodiesel 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.240
 but also the traction capabilities of the gasoline 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.889
 santa fe is quite adequate to his image 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.260
 image of modern beautiful 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.010
 comfortable car capable of 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:05.120
 overcoming 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:07.100
 easy off-road certainly with his 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.350
 low-profile passenger clearance 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.510
 tires long body overhangs and 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.940
 Santa's short-stroke suspension who does not 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.220
 capable of off-road exploits but by 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.229
 snowy primer easily transports out 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.940
 a snowdrift in the yard will be chosen yes and on 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.400
 the sidewalk near the business center at 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.530
 need will call in off-road

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.160
 forced electric lock 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.530
 hydraulics in the front wheel drive and 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.530
 systems to overcome slippery slopes 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.389
 What can I say in the end a new trick 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.100
 smtp we liked the time when 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.020
 Korean cars were chosen because 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.729
 low prices gradually goes away 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.430
 turning their purchase choice is not only 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.560
 Mind my heart fate is a crossover like 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.580
 much synthesis he will give he is capable yet 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.389
 rafe even the most discerning 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.389
