waterproof for a very very long time

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.890 
waterproof for a very very long time
because<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.430> makes<00:00:34.580> it<00:00:34.730> fabric<00:00:35.060> far<00:00:35.720> more

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
because it makes it fabric far more

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.980 
because it makes it fabric far more

resistant to UV degradation the frame of
the<00:00:39.050> tent<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:39.380> made<00:00:39.560> up<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.860> DAC<00:00:40.540> t6<00:00:41.540> alloy

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the tent is made up of DAC t6 alloy

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.200 
the tent is made up of DAC t6 alloy
poles<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.070> they<00:00:43.220> start<00:00:43.490> on<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.730> outside<00:00:43.850> of

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
poles and they start on the outside of

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.880 
poles and they start on the outside of
the<00:00:44.300> tent<00:00:44.540> and<00:00:44.660> then<00:00:44.990> they're<00:00:45.170> transferred<00:00:45.560> to

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
the tent and then they're transferred to

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.340 
the tent and then they're transferred to
internal<00:00:46.070> pole<00:00:46.730> sleeves<00:00:46.970> so<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:47.690> really

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
internal pole sleeves so that really

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.870 
internal pole sleeves so that really
increases<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.800> overall<00:00:49.190> stability<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.700> your

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
increases the overall stability of your

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.970 
increases the overall stability of your
tent<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.780> also<00:00:50.930> makes<00:00:51.350> sure<00:00:51.440> that<00:00:51.560> it's

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
tent and it also makes sure that it's

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.840 
tent and it also makes sure that it's
nice<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:53.140> aerodynamic<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:54.320> well<00:00:54.790> all<00:00:55.790> the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
nice and aerodynamic as well all the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.819 
nice and aerodynamic as well all the
features<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:56.329> here<00:00:56.600> you'll<00:00:57.140> see<00:00:57.320> that<00:00:57.620> we<00:00:57.800> have

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
features on here you'll see that we have

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.520 
features on here you'll see that we have
these<00:00:58.489> large<00:00:58.880> ventilation<00:00:59.570> panels<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.350> these

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
these large ventilation panels and these

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.200 
these large ventilation panels and these
are<00:01:00.649> quite<00:01:00.829> unique<00:01:00.980> because<00:01:01.130> not<00:01:01.880> only<00:01:01.910> are

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
are quite unique because not only are

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.179 
are quite unique because not only are
they<00:01:02.300> accessible<00:01:02.780> from<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.170> outside<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:04.129> you

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
they accessible from the outside but you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.740 
they accessible from the outside but you
can<00:01:04.339> close<00:01:04.519> them<00:01:04.699> over<00:01:04.939> from<00:01:05.149> the<00:01:05.269> inside<00:01:05.600> of

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
can close them over from the inside of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.080 
can close them over from the inside of
the<00:01:05.840> tent<00:01:06.050> as<00:01:06.200> well<00:01:06.380> on<00:01:06.890> here<00:01:07.460> we'll<00:01:07.610> also<00:01:07.760> see

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
the tent as well on here we'll also see

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.160 
the tent as well on here we'll also see
our<00:01:08.300> robbins

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
our robbins

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.190 
our robbins
red<00:01:09.530> guy<00:01:09.950> lines<00:01:10.190> here<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:10.729> nice<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.810> visible

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
red guy lines here so nice and visible

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.020 
red guy lines here so nice and visible
and<00:01:12.470> particularly<00:01:13.010> at<00:01:13.310> night<00:01:13.340> because<00:01:13.850> we

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
and particularly at night because we

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.790 
and particularly at night because we
have<00:01:14.210> these<00:01:14.510> reflective<00:01:15.080> points<00:01:15.350> on<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:15.650> so

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
have these reflective points on here so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.440 
have these reflective points on here so
when<00:01:15.950> you've<00:01:16.040> got<00:01:16.070> your<00:01:16.190> head<00:01:16.430> torch<00:01:16.700> on<00:01:16.909> you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
when you've got your head torch on you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.700 
when you've got your head torch on you
should<00:01:17.600> be<00:01:17.720> able<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.930> see<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.320> nice<00:01:18.680> and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
should be able to see this nice and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.100 
should be able to see this nice and
easily<00:01:19.010> well<00:01:19.970> also<00:01:20.120> notice<00:01:20.540> just<00:01:20.750> on<00:01:20.900> here

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
easily well also notice just on here

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.080 
easily well also notice just on here
that<00:01:21.380> we<00:01:21.500> use<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.920> climb<00:01:22.280> cleat<00:01:22.549> guy<00:01:22.760> runners

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
that we use the climb cleat guy runners

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.830 
that we use the climb cleat guy runners
so<00:01:23.360> very<00:01:23.960> simple<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.530> adjust<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.840> tighten

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
so very simple to adjust and to tighten

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840 
so very simple to adjust and to tighten
like<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.220> can<00:01:28.340> do<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.700> there

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
like so and you can do that in there

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.030 
like so and you can do that in there
will<00:01:28.940> self<00:01:29.270> lock<00:01:29.540> now<00:01:30.380> all<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.680> these<00:01:30.770> guy

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
will self lock now all of these guy

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.980 
will self lock now all of these guy
lanes<00:01:31.280> all<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.549> way<00:01:31.640> around<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.000> tent<00:01:32.210> I've

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
lanes all the way around the tent I've

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.510 
lanes all the way around the tent I've
got<00:01:33.170> their<00:01:33.290> own<00:01:33.320> retainers<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.070> when<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.340> comes

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
got their own retainers so when it comes

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.100 
got their own retainers so when it comes
to<00:01:34.700> packing<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> tent<00:01:35.240> away<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:35.659> can<00:01:35.810> wrap<00:01:35.990> up

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
to packing the tent away we can wrap up

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.539 
to packing the tent away we can wrap up
the<00:01:36.260> guylines<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.740> our<00:01:36.860> hand<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.159> pop<00:01:37.369> them
