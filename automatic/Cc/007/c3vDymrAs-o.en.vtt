but the trucks pretty much totaled at

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.120 
but the trucks pretty much totaled at
this<00:05:15.280> point<00:05:16.290> you'd<00:05:17.290> have<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.650> have<00:05:17.800> some

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
you know at a feasible price but I

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.080 
you know at a feasible price but I
expected<00:05:29.889> to<00:05:30.010> see<00:05:30.190> some<00:05:30.370> dead<00:05:30.550> rodents<00:05:30.940> in

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090

expected to see some dead rodents in
here<00:05:31.590> just<00:05:32.590> based<00:05:32.830> on<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.160> smell<00:05:33.460> but<00:05:33.700> it's

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
here just based on the smell but it's

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.879 
here just based on the smell but it's
obvious<00:05:34.690> with<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:34.900> amount<00:05:35.139> of<00:05:35.229> feces<00:05:35.650> that's

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
obvious with the amount of feces that's

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.210 
obvious with the amount of feces that's
up<00:05:36.040> inside<00:05:36.370> this<00:05:36.520> box<00:05:36.790> that<00:05:37.919> you<00:05:38.919> know<00:05:39.040> that's
