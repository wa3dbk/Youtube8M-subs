00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.310
 I want to tell you when we have been working for security for 16 years 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.090
 touring the country with this safety talk and when we talk about safety 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 we talk about the tire in the most important part a car 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.640
 import the car that they have matters what they did not pay or import what models and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.380
 well sporty rural family absolutely 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.419
 the only part that touches the floor is the tire 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.419
 and then this one does not give you the right pressure 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.960
 the tire can not do all the things it is capable of and for what it was 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.790
 designed to see how to build a smaller one 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000
 and seeks attention in this 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.180
 in this area and infographics 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.570
 that the colors of the temperature that it is really taking is an image 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 spectacular 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:57.610
 a bum boom bum boom p the control of a romantic in the middle value marvel 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.780
 century that would be 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.520
 pair of lannan hitters 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.510
 a time on the sides and after 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.960
 the torque of where the casing will go to the tread 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.340
 with the tires are radial as you can see the nylon threads or 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 steel run radially over the roof 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 and after all this 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.790
 a mixture of different types of rubber is made for the different parts of the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.620
 tire is not the same as the heel than the side and of course 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.810
 the tread is not the same 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 but with all that mixture and then baked at more than 150 degrees 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.320
 temperature 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.850
 it ends up coming out lion more said that the pri we do not know with the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 eye that we usually know 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 in this way 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 exact 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.650
 and it's amazing to see how a factory bank 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.430
 very different coils of the north said that they are coming together in the room adds in 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.720
 dinner that will offer a cover or low profile like this 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.460
 we are seeing cut environment as seventh difficult 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.900
 Romantic 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.940
 in a curve in a curve when the car oblÃ³n double a cooked mate supporting 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.789
 but clear raise temperature 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.429
 that's why you have that reddest image 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.469
 and when he puts it right 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.829
 be refrigerated somehow but when you are 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.109
 a donkey loin I do not tell you the people the donkey loin that there is for my house 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.439
 ayman donkey loin that people are really a frightening thing 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:32.419
 and throughout the country not when you step on the back of a donkey what you are doing 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.080
 just compress this tire to the rim 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.909
 practically step the note 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.409
 he says he does not have the exact pressure in which he says the car manual does not 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.249
 I think it seems that something less than seem 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.509
 the one that says the author's manual if you do not have that the tire does not work 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:50.750
 how it has to work 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.379
 and it works for the worst always 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.299
 if this does not lower the police pressure was the pressure and for worse always in 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.359
 all cases 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.549
 therefore I would only approve the manual and the whole week with the 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.159
 cold tire after a stage of Maria Laura seems hard to him it was 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.700
 finally for james argentina be hard but good is this source the 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.439
 ocean temperature of the band exactly so that mate settles 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.250
 flex 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.409
 what you want is what the information has to offer
