00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 it is with us trillo pot 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.800
 despite this I think it is time for three goals when the July trio 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.300
 gutierrez with us gave us nothing well as expected the ceo I 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
 I think not and as such that future in the afternoon 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.330
 beatty good waving be at 100 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.189
 happy that things are being given to me 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.090
 the gentleman who has remained but by asia 3 per party 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.259
 let yourself be drawn 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:22.609
 in a couple of games 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.890
 savage to the other by valdeorras in gambia 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.600
 although we will be growing 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.679
 because he always wants to score three good goals 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.759
 we are working for that and good 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.450
 demonstrating the conditions we have the amount of the stretch 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.510
 they work 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.670
 it's not a pressure and much less badly healthy and just barely a joke 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 they were really what visit now bumping shots to a racing that can injury 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.310
 gio moreno 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.300
 efe is moving the racing people think they found the solution very 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.560
 quickly not 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.020
 yes a quiet come back are doing things right 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.300
 and he went back to see who is who we enjoy and we have a lot of people 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.490
 the helicopter is one percent player 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.510
 that from the principle that 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.730
 appears in Colombian soccer at 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.020
 the lolos was to meet in the canyon fc 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260
 well this one of a 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.130
 was distinguished by its definition by its coldness the Colombian player the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 Colombian forward 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.280
 it does not stand out very much because of that, not finally because it's very fast because 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 It is strong because 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.840
 the dynamic because it stands out but not much to define 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.030
 where do I have that passivity that you have for 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.520
 stopped not getting nervous when you have to define in the in the area 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.270
 not much peace of mind about working with the commissions that I have in a world 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.730
 strong countries in my strong and good 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.160
 waiting for my partner to know me more and so we go 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.420
 to give the best of me for what 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 enjoy my place in melbourne 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.430
 if I'm not wrong if he had right or left and caixa nova and yes 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.260
 tinsa accomplice with everything a striker can do 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.580
 yes that the most important thing is to have the confidence that just barely 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.400
 scoring and that 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.030
 that when this gene 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.810
 to define who are thousandths of a second and good has to have a lot 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.400
 quiet a lot of trust percent but to say hello let's see but 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.699
 images of euro heroes racing 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.289
 of what I said I played matches a little bit of another but we're going to give 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.419
 that's why he's very loved by racing people is maracana hunger 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
 satisfied to apply his trophy flavor model 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.349
 it is the northwest 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.849
 that has concorde 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.089
 that has conditions is quickly understood 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.340
 in any country said in any team 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.759
 francella and shelves 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.999
 he moves very well 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.999
 fidel has good movements for it 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.249
 flyers coexist more easily garden and that is in that match 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.920
 1 the wall tdt that publicly realizes by its age of the deceased that goal 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.939
 the taco bell pulls for the moment the district is going to define 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.229
 it seems that it is a contribution 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.229
 fundamental for that goal 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.889
 there we have it 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.869
 with his displacements on the offensive 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.629
 that is to say for each adolescent son by the time for them 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.629
 great center to be able to enjoy it 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.969
 hits the ball very well 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.579
 you always need a partner 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.639
 play and I said it's a great driver are somehow already training 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.999
 it shows that there is preparation has gone 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 an important axis 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.609
 many young people 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.359
 that worked throughout the week and today when the party arrives added but to 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.019
 how they bargain 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.429
 Very confident 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.959
 the talent he has 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.989
 they will employ caÃ±izÃ¡ 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.269
 the right or left 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.609
 Masferrer explained why he also defines with the left 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.159
 because confession now the psoe 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 I love 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.959
 double 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.689
 I have always wanted to improve my leg 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.299
 it's interesting to see how we can parts 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.959
 the team game did not speak 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.849
 the police chief already 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.959
 that were tobacco due to causes that do not pass to Balears the intervention was 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.840
 made in that play 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.930
 now it seems that the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.059
 But only 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:25.779
 I do not know if it's your case but 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.999
 not only you agree with the segob 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:32.339
 the head of the state gaming circuit is one thing that you see that you like that you 

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.499
 back strips 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:34.879
 do not give the wall 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.770
 intact freight 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.169
 silva is important but I never love playing with the ball 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:42.849
 I still do not get a hundred percent 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.830
 very unhappy to 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.830
 routes or be very cautious and enjoy the game 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.319
 all black 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.870
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.510
 eva beat him ivam bitter is extracted a weapon was removed but good so that 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.340
 insure pass 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.460
 there must be a good movement then 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.120
 the starting not being flying tb and seeing him fast 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 there is the advantage neither contest before pardons and that mark the play 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.569
 also carlos space suddenly out there when he does not mark 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.580
 a goal is concerned to offer 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.289
 yesterday the template efe 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.929
 I know you can also create the space your partner the titan well 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:20.849
 the one that can be seen better 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.340
 For his part, he made it very simple to say that it was not so simple 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.879
 I wanted to ask you 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:31.009
 the decision was to play in argentina and especially racing I guess it had 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.759
 something to do with the presence 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:33.590
 in fact 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.069
 in the team 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.369
 you were a little bad now having to be fashionable without him at least 

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:43.369
 time it recovers that ocala be as short as possible 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.850
 good he's because you're my way do it because hey 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.850
 they asked him a lot and I admire 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.270
 good 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.460
 with a diameter miami but who knows us some of the elections 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.190
 a great player a great person has shown here in Argentina does not want 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.240
 much 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.300
 percent 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.389
 the pop art star in showing his working conditions on the other hand 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:08.669
 sanz 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.889
 is not worth anything is that someone recommend you and what I love before de gea 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.139
 with it the Colombian soccer spokesman the next what is also not his 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.999
 I vote for your experience in Turkey but not precisely because of that as follows 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.199
 a lot was talked about what happened I had to say that every time I had the 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.830
 opportunity to counterattack 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.259
 presumes very familiar 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.960
 always the family and 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.960
 and now opportunely he has his family here close 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.770
 what happened in turkey really had to do with the discomfort of 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.270
 his family that we did not let him be quiet too 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.300
 it's me this is still very good 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.550
 very bad idea because good 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.610
 in my family, not 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.540
 one was calm and the children studied was a great culture very 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.689
 complicated a very complicated and good script 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.719
 which our family well 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.949
 is not 100% 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.399
 so I told that to him and what good 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:03.090
 that it was the best thing why he was going through a good time and that 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.830
 that football was very good for me and they understood why sundance 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.539
 answer
