so<00:00:01.050> be<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.260> video<00:00:01.500> showing<00:00:01.979> how<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.370> use<00:00:03.330> your

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
so be a video showing how to use your

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.349 
so be a video showing how to use your
bombers<00:00:04.259> so<00:00:04.859> here<00:00:05.069> we<00:00:05.190> have<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.339> t1<00:00:05.730> bomber<00:00:06.150> some

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
bombers so here we have a t1 bomber some

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.720 
bombers so here we have a t1 bomber some
interceptors<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.140> scalp<00:00:07.410> first<00:00:08.250> thing<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.610> do

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
interceptors of scalp first thing to do

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
interceptors of scalp first thing to do
with<00:00:08.880> air<00:00:09.410> take<00:00:10.410> all<00:00:10.620> your<00:00:10.769> air<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.870> put<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> at

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
with air take all your air I put it at

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.289 
with air take all your air I put it at
ground<00:00:13.740> fire<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.700> makes<00:00:15.059> everything

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
ground fire that just makes everything

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.250 
ground fire that just makes everything
real<00:00:15.780> nice<00:00:16.020> your<00:00:16.949> fighters<00:00:17.400> shoot<00:00:17.730> more<00:00:18.260> well

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
real nice your fighters shoot more well

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
real nice your fighters shoot more well
scouts<00:00:19.560> doesn't<00:00:19.920> really<00:00:20.039> matter<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:21.359> then

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
scouts doesn't really matter and then

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.820 
scouts doesn't really matter and then
for<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> Bombers<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> makes<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.680> huge

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
for the Bombers it makes a huge

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.259 
for the Bombers it makes a huge
difference<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:25.400> one<00:00:26.400> thing<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.939> need<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> know

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
difference so one thing you need to know

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
difference so one thing you need to know
about<00:00:27.359> bombers<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.590> long<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.830> they're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
about bombers is that as long as they're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.089 
about bombers is that as long as they're
moving<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> straight<00:00:29.670> direction<00:00:30.949> you<00:00:31.949> can

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
moving in a straight direction you can

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709 
moving in a straight direction you can
see<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> most<00:00:33.210> important<00:00:33.540> things

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
see it's the most important things

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.209 
see it's the most important things
bombers<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.440> turning<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> see

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
bombers don't like turning so you see

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.080 
bombers don't like turning so you see
the<00:00:35.309> move<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:36.050> as<00:00:37.340> long<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> bombing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the move here as long as the bombing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.979 
the move here as long as the bombing
position<00:00:42.350> is<00:00:43.789> in<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> direction<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:47.989> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
position is in the direction that the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.010 
position is in the direction that the
bomber<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.410> moving<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.890> keep<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.520> bombing

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.980 

see<00:00:58.010> don't<00:00:58.910> want<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.150> abuse<00:00:59.270> this<00:00:59.570> too<00:00:59.840> much

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
see don't want to abuse this too much

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.830 
see don't want to abuse this too much
foot<00:01:03.879> so<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.000> reason<00:01:05.150> that<00:01:05.390> it's<00:01:05.660> actually

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
foot so the reason that it's actually

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.720 
foot so the reason that it's actually
hard<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.320> do<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:06.620> in<00:01:06.800> game<00:01:07.010> is<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.340> usually

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
hard to do this in game is that usually

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.370 
hard to do this in game is that usually
enemy<00:01:08.030> units<00:01:08.300> are<00:01:08.450> not<00:01:08.630> in<00:01:08.870> a<00:01:08.990> nice<00:01:09.170> straight

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
enemy units are not in a nice straight

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.220 
enemy units are not in a nice straight
line<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.940> also<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.480> Strad<00:01:11.720> bombers<00:01:12.050> this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
line and also the Strad bombers this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.580 
line and also the Strad bombers this
distance<00:01:12.680> between<00:01:13.070> bombs<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.640> much<00:01:13.820> longer<00:01:14.590> to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
distance between bombs is much longer to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.950 
distance between bombs is much longer to
bombers<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:16.190> do<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.400> pretty<00:01:16.610> well<00:01:16.960> so

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
bombers you can do this pretty well so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.110 
bombers you can do this pretty well so
if<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.140> think<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:18.710> your<00:01:19.280> mass<00:01:19.610> extractor

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
if you think this is your mass extractor

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.030 
if you think this is your mass extractor
here<00:01:20.330> your<00:01:20.510> targets<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.110> want<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.350> hit<00:01:21.979> a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
here your targets you want to hit a

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.120 
here your targets you want to hit a
little<00:01:22.400> bit<00:01:22.810> past<00:01:23.810> where<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.410> vast<00:01:24.560> extractor

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
little bit past where the vast extractor

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.060 
little bit past where the vast extractor
is<00:01:25.160> vomit<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.840> move<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.650> next<00:01:27.800> mass

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
is vomit and move to the next mass

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.160 
is vomit and move to the next mass
extractor<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.540> bomber<00:01:29.750> gets<00:01:30.020> in

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
extractor so that it the bomber gets in

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.730 
extractor so that it the bomber gets in
a<00:01:30.229> straight<00:01:30.500> line<00:01:32.140> second<00:01:33.140> ball<00:01:33.320> maybe<00:01:33.530> this

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
a straight line second ball maybe this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.249 
a straight line second ball maybe this
your<00:01:33.950> next<00:01:34.070> mass<00:01:34.340> extractor<00:01:34.940> get<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.050> bomber

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
your next mass extractor get the bomber

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.100 
your next mass extractor get the bomber
in<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.710> straight<00:01:36.950> line<00:01:39.009> another<00:01:40.009> bomb<00:01:41.110> just

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
in a straight line another bomb just

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.030 
in a straight line another bomb just
right<00:01:42.590> after<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.009> throw<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.490> bombs<00:01:43.700> off

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
right after you throw the bombs off

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.639 
right after you throw the bombs off
you'll<00:01:46.040> want<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.280> give<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.640> new<00:01:46.790> move<00:01:46.970> order

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
you'll want to give it a new move order

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.320 
you'll want to give it a new move order
and<00:01:48.649> as<00:01:48.770> soon<00:01:49.040> as<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.340> let<00:01:49.700> go<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.119> bombs

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
and as soon as it let go of the bombs

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.200 
and as soon as it let go of the bombs
you<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.780> start<00:01:51.020> turning

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.310 

so<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.900> can<00:01:57.080> see<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:58.960> hopefully<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.110> was<00:02:00.290> a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
so you can see this hopefully this was a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.430 
so you can see this hopefully this was a
useful<00:02:00.740> demonstration
