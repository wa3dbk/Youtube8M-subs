what I love about Korean restaurants is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840 
what I love about Korean restaurants is
that<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.320> serve<00:01:10.590> barley<00:01:11.130> tea<00:01:11.369> while<00:01:11.729> we're

drinking right now I thought it was

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
drinking right now I thought it was
pouring<00:01:13.590> tea<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.340> barley<00:01:14.640> and
