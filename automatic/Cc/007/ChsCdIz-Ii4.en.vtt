the<00:00:29.910> six<00:00:30.150> string<00:00:30.360> guitar<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.960> find<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.949> best<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the six string guitar I find it best to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
the six string guitar I find it best to
look<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:33.000> teams<00:00:33.360> from<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> six<00:00:34.620> string

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
look at these teams from a six string

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.369 
look at these teams from a six string
perspective<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:35.879> and<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.330> add<00:00:36.629> on<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
perspective first and then add on the

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.070 
perspective first and then add on the
other<00:00:37.500> strings<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> eight<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.510> believe

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
other strings to go to eight I believe

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.600 
other strings to go to eight I believe
that's<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.530> best<00:00:40.860> way<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.519> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that's the best way to kind of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910 
that's the best way to kind of
conceptualize<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.590> doing<00:00:43.830> with

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
conceptualize what you're doing with

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
conceptualize what you're doing with
these<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.580> to<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> B<00:00:45.030> 11<00:00:45.510> tuning<00:00:45.960> what

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
these to get to the B 11 tuning what

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.130 
these to get to the B 11 tuning what
we're<00:00:46.620> gonna<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.979> is<00:00:47.190> change<00:00:47.220> this<00:00:48.140> second

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
we're gonna do is change this second

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.079 
we're gonna do is change this second
string<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.409> C<00:00:49.710> sharp<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.220> C<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:50.970> gonna

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
string to C sharp and C so you're gonna

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.069 
string to C sharp and C so you're gonna
get

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.520 

and<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:57.320> sharpie

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and I have a sharpie

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
and I have a sharpie
he<00:00:59.129> turned<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.520> minor<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.540> used<00:01:00.720> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> CCE

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
he turned out minor it used to be a CCE

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.530 
he turned out minor it used to be a CCE
on<00:01:01.530> top<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> c-sharp<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> minor<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
on top to a c-sharp you got a minor I

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.500 
on top to a c-sharp you got a minor I
see<00:01:03.840> my<00:01:03.960> major<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.820> IED<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.240> right

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
see my major and you try IED now right

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.430 
there alright the next thing I do is
changes<00:01:12.000> G<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:15.210> before<00:01:15.479> spring<00:01:15.780> down<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.320> an

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
changes G just before spring down to an

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.240 
changes G just before spring down to an
F<00:01:16.619> sharp

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.980 

you're<00:01:21.250> gonna<00:01:21.369> go

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
I got a nice f-sharp minor seventh chord

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.110 
I got a nice f-sharp minor seventh chord
there<00:01:27.160> F<00:01:27.370> sharp<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.970> C<00:01:28.030> sharp<00:01:28.780> E<00:01:29.500> on<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.880> top

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
there F sharp a C sharp E on the top

there F sharp a C sharp E on the top
four<00:01:31.450> strings<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.490> next<00:01:33.670> we're<00:01:33.760> gonna<00:01:33.820> do<00:01:34.090> is

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
four strings the next we're gonna do is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.950 
four strings the next we're gonna do is
take<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.320> fifth<00:01:35.979> string<00:01:36.310> because

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
take this fifth string because

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.050 
take this fifth string because
previously<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:39.100> e<00:01:39.400> we're<00:01:39.640> gonna<00:01:39.729> take<00:01:39.910> that

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
previously an e we're gonna take that

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.980 
previously an e we're gonna take that
down<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.510> D<00:01:40.720> sharp

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
down to D sharp

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.500 
down to D sharp
you<00:01:43.990> get

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.210 

these<00:01:47.200> sharp

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.390 

which<00:01:51.730> is<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.440> diminished<00:01:53.440> triad<00:01:53.560> but<00:01:54.220> let's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
which is a diminished triad but let's

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.310 
which is a diminished triad but let's
not<00:01:54.550> even<00:01:54.640> get<00:01:54.850> into<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.180> let's<00:01:55.900> just<00:01:56.050> start

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
not even get into that let's just start

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.170 
not even get into that let's just start
to<00:01:56.470> hear<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.830> sound<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.430> D<00:01:57.700> sharp<00:01:58.000> F

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
to hear the sound of this D sharp F

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.490 
to hear the sound of this D sharp F
sharp<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.720> C<00:01:59.140> sharp<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.740> E<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:02.350> were

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
sharp and C sharp and E and then were

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.740 
sharp and C sharp and E and then were
going<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.680> take<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.160> six<00:02:04.060> frame<00:02:04.270> which<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.420> C

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
going to take the six frame which is C

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.230 
going to take the six frame which is C
we're<00:02:04.990> gonna<00:02:05.080> take<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.380> up<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.700> C<00:02:07.600> sharp

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.150 

that's<00:02:13.240> what<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.510> get<00:02:13.660> C<00:02:14.290> sharp<00:02:14.560> G<00:02:14.650> sharp<00:02:14.740> F

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
that's what you get C sharp G sharp F

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.420 
that's what you get C sharp G sharp F
sharp

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
sharp

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.290 
sharp
c-sharp<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.299> key

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
c-sharp and key

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.690 
c-sharp and key
and<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.750> 11th<00:02:22.320> tuning<00:02:22.770> for<00:02:23.580> these

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and that is the be 11th tuning for these

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.200 
and that is the be 11th tuning for these
two<00:02:23.940> lower<00:02:24.150> strings<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.860> keep<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.460> here

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
two lower strings I can keep this a here

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.590 
two lower strings I can keep this a here
on<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.660> seventh<00:02:28.170> because<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.700> low<00:02:29.910> c6

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
on the seventh because I was in low c6

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.800 
on the seventh because I was in low c6
so<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.140> an<00:02:31.290> A<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:33.210> seventh<00:02:33.510> string<00:02:33.720> so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
so this is an A on the seventh string so

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930 
so this is an A on the seventh string so
I'll<00:02:33.870> keep<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.520> lowest

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
I'll keep that and for the the lowest

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.920 
I'll keep that and for the the lowest
the<00:02:36.090> eighth<00:02:36.240> string<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:39.030> did<00:02:39.480> varies
