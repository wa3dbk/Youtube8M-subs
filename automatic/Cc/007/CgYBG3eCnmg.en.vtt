00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 before viewing this video vi 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.790
 I remember that last night Gta 4 came out 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.309
 film life in liberty city if not 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.230
 you have still seen see it I did not want 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.059
 make the video attached to the film but 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 unfortunately I have to because there is news 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 really interesting on gta 5 so if 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.289
 you didn't see that movie maybe later 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.600
 this video go to hello everyone 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.980
 guys are ultra super fast videos 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.369
 special rockstar games released 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 a news that talks about the epilon 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.689
 program for those who have had gta san andreas 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 probably knows what a kind of is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 religion that there is us san andreas that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 similar to those of scientology 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.570
 scientology a parody in short of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480
 whatever you want scientology o 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 Scientologists is but letting loose the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 religion that is taken up by san 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.649
 andreas 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.440
 they made a video explaining it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 in which it is seen in the background in a manner 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.260
 unfortunately altered because there are gods 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.129
 blue filters etcetera etc. because 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.930
 attention should be focused 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 on the written but it is seen in the background 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.469
 of the gameplay taken from the game that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 let's see immediately 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.549
 ok we are here seeing the video is that a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.310
 boy managed to remove the writing 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.860
 this and gameplay from gta 5 here 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.049
 we see the sea an island with a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 tree with the moon that came out in that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 beautiful way because usually you don't 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.720
 it moved that way and the mountains here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.500
 we are probably in the campaign of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 san andreas 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.759
 I think this is the lake and not the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.290
 sea ​​but I'm not sure it could 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.570
 also be the sea 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 I only know that the atmosphere is altered by a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.049
 however, video filter is really beautiful 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.610
 realistic you see the machines in 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.340
 background the clouds moving i 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.540
 filter the birds the water really 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.750
 wonderful 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 in short, environmental details that were 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 a bit already seen in the onel screenshots 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 frey the weapon we are seeing here from 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 a completely new angle thanks 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 to this video on the xilon program 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.509
 issued by rockstar games yesterday with i 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.759
 headlines ahead but what we are 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.469
 managed to get without titles is really 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.200
 a really beautiful landscape and 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.200
 realistic that in my opinion 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 it really will be that is not a question of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.690
 graphic and just alive is here you see 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.170
 even a mill excuse a lighthouse then 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.940
 most probably it is the sea 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.680
 with even reflected rocks 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.030
 on the water etcetera I believe 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.040
 that the graphics of this game are 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.349
 unfortunately really high levels 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.690
 have had limitations with xbox 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.550
 360 and playstation 3, however, is still one 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.620
 beautiful graphics that fully exploits with i 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.410
 engines and those those graphics cards 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.260
 etc. but it is that it is really alive that is me 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.940
 I repeat this in every live video 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.970
 there is a living environment there are people 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.959
 lives there is everything in an ecosystem 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 wonderful that had never been seen on 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.190
 gta iv su gta san andreas 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.510
 and that's why I also love the way in 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.209
 which developed this game that 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 surely it will not be excelled from one point 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.630
 of graphic view in the sense that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.819
 battlefield 4 battlefield 3 at the end 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.019
 they could also be result 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.269
 graphic winners 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.959
 so here we see some details 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.420
 really interesting what to say guys 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.489
 still missing or less than 150 days comes out 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.620
 on 17 September 2013 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.750
 for now we have only three videos i have 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.609
 including this or the first the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.010
 second and this first video e 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.350
 second trailer of course and we have a 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.450
 hundred screenshots or maybe less me 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.700
 I remind you that I have an official playlist 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.519
 with all the videos I made on gta 5 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.780
 I've already done over 25 on the game that 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.380
 it hasn't come out yet so it takes 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.720
 courage 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 and the most interesting videos are those 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.380
 in which I analyze all the screenshots 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.329
 so far never released where I speak 40 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.519
 minutes in a row or the dubbing of 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.350
 trailer in short continue to follow me to 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.780

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.730
 single detail on this game because
