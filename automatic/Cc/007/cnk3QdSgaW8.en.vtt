um a little bit about the lens it was

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.540 
um a little bit about the lens it was
first<00:00:34.660> built<00:00:35.050> or<00:00:35.410> if<00:00:35.920> they<00:00:36.250> started

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
first built or if they started

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.479 
first built or if they started
manufacturing<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:37.270> lens<00:00:37.570> in<00:00:38.280> 1990<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.400> was

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
manufacturing this lens in 1990 it was

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.660 
manufacturing this lens in 1990 it was
an<00:00:39.610> AIS<00:00:40.030> version<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.629> then<00:00:40.989> in<00:00:41.290> 1995<00:00:42.129> they<00:00:42.430> re

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
an AIS version and then in 1995 they re

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.670 
an AIS version and then in 1995 they re
engineered<00:00:43.150> this<00:00:43.300> lens<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.930> make<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.470> D

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
since this is the D version um it's one

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590 
since this is the D version um it's one

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
manufacturing today not sure how much

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.660 
manufacturing today not sure how much
longer<00:00:56.440> they'll<00:00:56.620> continue<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.010> manufacture

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
longer they'll continue to manufacture

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.240 
longer they'll continue to manufacture
it<00:00:58.110> as<00:00:59.110> far<00:00:59.320> as<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.500> build<00:00:59.710> quality<00:00:59.950> of<00:01:00.130> this

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the lens it's got a nice smooth draw to

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.809 
the lens it's got a nice smooth draw to
it<00:01:43.149> when<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.630> gets<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.959> infinity<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.500> stops

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
it when it gets to infinity it stops

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.219 
it when it gets to infinity it stops
when<00:01:45.819> it<00:01:45.849> gets<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.270> closest<00:01:46.720> focusing

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
when it gets as closest focusing

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.249 
when it gets as closest focusing
distance<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.709> also<00:01:47.860> stops<00:01:48.899> when<00:01:49.899> you<00:01:49.959> put<00:01:50.170> it

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
distance it also stops when you put it

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.339 
distance it also stops when you put it
to<00:01:50.380> automatic<00:01:51.509> you'll<00:01:52.509> hear<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.780> click<00:01:52.990> and

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
to automatic you'll hear it click and

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.240 
to automatic you'll hear it click and
then<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.280> won't<00:01:54.399> move<00:01:54.640> anymore<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.770> will<00:01:56.950> need

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
then it won't move anymore you will need

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.440 
then it won't move anymore you will need
a<00:01:57.720> camera<00:01:58.720> with<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.610> autofocus<00:02:00.610> motor<00:02:00.849> to<00:02:01.209> use

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
a camera with a autofocus motor to use

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.059 
a camera with a autofocus motor to use
auto<00:02:01.840> focus<00:02:02.200> with<00:02:02.349> this<00:02:02.470> lens<00:02:02.679> otherwise

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
auto focus with this lens otherwise

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.779 
auto focus with this lens otherwise
it'll<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.369> be<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> manual<00:02:04.090> focus<00:02:04.450> lens<00:02:05.789> this

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
it'll just be a manual focus lens this

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.990 
it'll just be a manual focus lens this
is<00:02:06.849> the<00:02:07.090> DC<00:02:07.479> control<00:02:07.810> I'll<00:02:08.259> go<00:02:08.530> over<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:09.000> I'll

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
is the DC control I'll go over it I'll

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.280 
is the DC control I'll go over it I'll
go<00:02:10.179> over<00:02:10.270> more<00:02:10.479> about<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> little<00:02:10.989> bit<00:02:11.080> later

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
go over more about a little bit later

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.910 
go over more about a little bit later
but<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.310> basically<00:02:12.550> has<00:02:12.819> front<00:02:13.709> focus<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
but it basically has front focus and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.150 
but it basically has front focus and
rear<00:02:15.520> focus<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.900> what<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.230> does<00:02:17.530> essentially

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
rear focus so what this does essentially

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.100 
rear focus so what this does essentially
is<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.640> allows<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.450> control<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
is it allows you to control the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.820 
is it allows you to control the
out-of-focus<00:02:20.500> elements<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.660> your<00:02:22.660> image<00:02:23.050> in

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
out-of-focus elements in your image in

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.850 
out-of-focus elements in your image in
the<00:02:24.250> foreground<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.810> rear<00:02:26.080> so

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the foreground or in the rear so

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.440 
the foreground or in the rear so
basically<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.459> allows<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.180> better

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
basically it allows you to better

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.530 
basically it allows you to better
manipulate<00:02:29.170> your<00:02:29.500> bokeh<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:30.939> have<00:02:31.180> you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
manipulate your bokeh so you have you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.390 
manipulate your bokeh so you have you
have<00:02:31.569> neutral<00:02:32.230> right<00:02:32.349> now<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.860> at<00:02:33.010> neutral

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
have neutral right now it's at neutral

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.350 
have neutral right now it's at neutral
and<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.579> can<00:02:33.760> move

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
and you can move

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.340 
and you can move
at<00:02:34.450> 5.6<00:02:35.050> on<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.950> front<00:02:36.190> side<00:02:36.430> all<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.970> way<00:02:37.090> to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
at 5.6 on the front side all the way to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.640 
at 5.6 on the front side all the way to
the<00:02:38.350> rear<00:02:38.620> 5.6<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.880> on<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.600> backside<00:02:41.560> on

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the rear 5.6 on the on the backside on

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.360 
the rear 5.6 on the on the backside on
quick<00:02:44.650> take<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> look<00:02:45.040> at<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:45.220> lens<00:02:47.370> it's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
quick take a look at this lens it's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.630 
quick take a look at this lens it's
really<00:02:48.790> great<00:02:49.150> built<00:02:49.480> lens<00:02:50.250> because<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.430> all

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
really great built lens because it's all

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.580 
really great built lens because it's all
metal<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.510> said<00:02:52.690> I'm<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.930> fan<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.410> D

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
metal as I said I'm a fan of the D

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.310 
metal as I said I'm a fan of the D
lenses<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
lenses I like that

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.920 
lenses I like that
feel<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.620> tact<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.310> feel<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:58.210> what<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.780> D

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
feel that tact I feel of what the D

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.440 
feel that tact I feel of what the D
lenses<00:02:59.290> have<00:02:59.500> nowadays<00:03:00.220> Nikon<00:03:00.880> still<00:03:01.240> makes

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
lenses have nowadays Nikon still makes

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.180 
lenses have nowadays Nikon still makes
great<00:03:01.750> glass<00:03:02.110> optically<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.010> don't

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
great glass optically but they don't

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.270 
great glass optically but they don't
make<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.460> lot<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.880> metal<00:03:04.560> lenses<00:03:05.560> anymore

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
make a lot of metal lenses anymore

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.920 
make a lot of metal lenses anymore
for<00:03:06.760> example<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.330> 85<00:03:08.170> 1.4<00:03:09.100> G<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.690> great

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
for example the 85 1.4 G it's a great

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.290 
for example the 85 1.4 G it's a great
lens<00:03:11.200> wonderful<00:03:11.770> lens<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:12.340> not<00:03:12.910> metal

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
lens wonderful lens but it's not metal

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.670 
lens wonderful lens but it's not metal
anymore<00:03:13.600> it's<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.750> polycarbonate<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.410> kind<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
anymore it's a polycarbonate I kind of

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.880 
anymore it's a polycarbonate I kind of
like<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.670> feel<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:17.230> lens<00:03:17.440> also<00:03:17.709> has<00:03:17.860> a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
like that that feel this lens also has a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
like that that feel this lens also has a
built-in<00:03:18.340> hood<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.800> it's<00:03:21.130> got<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.610> felt

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
built-in hood and it's it's got a felt

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.660 
built-in hood and it's it's got a felt
lining<00:03:22.150> inside<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.190> kind<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.370> push

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
lining inside it and just kind of push

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.089 
lining inside it and just kind of push
it<00:03:24.820> down<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.180> work<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.540> back<00:03:25.720> in

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.420 

it's<00:03:30.090> got<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> metal<00:03:30.480> mount<00:03:32.599> here<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.500> can

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
it's got a metal mount here and then can

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.970 
it's got a metal mount here and then can
see<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> aperture<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.650> don't<00:03:37.650> know<00:03:37.709> if<00:03:37.799> that's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
see the aperture I don't know if that's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.319 
see the aperture I don't know if that's
coming<00:03:38.310> through<00:03:38.459> maybe<00:03:38.909> this<00:03:39.120> side<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.420> better

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
coming through maybe this side is better

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.509 
coming through maybe this side is better
so<00:03:42.329> there<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.599> is<00:03:42.750> closed<00:03:43.379> down<00:03:43.409> at<00:03:43.769> f-16<00:03:45.109> f11

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
so there it is closed down at f-16 f11

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.750 
so there it is closed down at f-16 f11
f8<00:03:47.519> f<00:03:48.510> 5<00:03:48.870> 6<00:03:49.260> F<00:03:50.129> 4<00:03:50.519> F<00:03:50.849> 2<00:03:51.200> 8<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.409> then<00:03:53.129> wide<00:03:53.310> open<00:03:53.640> at

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
f8 f 5 6 F 4 F 2 8 and then wide open at

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.660 
f8 f 5 6 F 4 F 2 8 and then wide open at
F<00:03:53.879> 2<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.750> let<00:04:01.200> me<00:04:01.290> try<00:04:01.409> to<00:04:01.470> explain<00:04:01.920> how<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.340> D

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
F 2 so let me try to explain how the D

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.839 
F 2 so let me try to explain how the D
focus<00:04:03.060> control<00:04:03.450> works<00:04:03.750> essentially<00:04:04.620> if<00:04:05.099> you

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
focus control works essentially if you

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.610 
focus control works essentially if you
shoot<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.180> neutral<00:04:06.659> then<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.139> lens<00:04:07.379> is

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
shoot a neutral then the lens is

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.849 
shoot a neutral then the lens is
basically<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.609> 135<00:04:09.480> prime<00:04:09.930> lens<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.590> still

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
basically a 135 prime lens and it still

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.879 
basically a 135 prime lens and it still
takes<00:04:11.099> great<00:04:11.609> and<00:04:11.849> fantastic<00:04:12.090> images<00:04:13.019> but

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
takes great and fantastic images but

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.800 
takes great and fantastic images but
let's<00:04:14.099> say<00:04:14.310> you're<00:04:14.549> you<00:04:14.909> have<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:15.090> subject<00:04:15.419> and

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
let's say you're you have a subject and

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.170 
let's say you're you have a subject and
you're<00:04:16.019> shooting<00:04:16.169> wide<00:04:16.500> open<00:04:16.829> at<00:04:16.949> f/2<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.609> you

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
you're shooting wide open at f/2 and you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.460 
you're shooting wide open at f/2 and you
want<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.479> further<00:04:18.690> blur<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.560> background<00:04:20.060> then

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
want to further blur the background then

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.439 
want to further blur the background then
you<00:04:22.470> want<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.830> move<00:04:23.009> the<00:04:23.250> D<00:04:23.430> focus<00:04:23.820> control<00:04:24.210> to

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
you want to move the D focus control to

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.870 
you want to move the D focus control to
match<00:04:24.690> your<00:04:25.020> aperture<00:04:25.470> at<00:04:25.590> f/2<00:04:26.070> which<00:04:26.729> would

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
match your aperture at f/2 which would

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.689 
match your aperture at f/2 which would
be<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.330> rear<00:04:27.720> if<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.710> want<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:29.039> further<00:04:29.250> blur

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
be to rear if you want to further blur

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.719 
be to rear if you want to further blur
to<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.970> foreground<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:30.900> you'll<00:04:31.229> put<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.590> on

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
to the foreground then you'll put it on

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.300 
to the foreground then you'll put it on
front<00:04:32.729> -<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:35.250> never<00:04:35.400> really<00:04:35.729> want<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.360> go<00:04:36.510> past

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
front - you never really want to go past

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.159 
front - you never really want to go past
the<00:04:38.310> aperture<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.240> you're<00:04:39.419> shooting<00:04:39.630> at<00:04:39.960> so

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
the aperture that you're shooting at so

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.899 
the aperture that you're shooting at so
if<00:04:40.260> you're<00:04:40.409> shooting<00:04:40.650> at<00:04:40.889> f/2<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.580> don't<00:04:41.760> want

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
if you're shooting at f/2 you don't want

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.779 
if you're shooting at f/2 you don't want
to<00:04:42.000> really<00:04:42.180> go<00:04:42.419> past<00:04:43.169> F<00:04:43.530> -<00:04:43.949> you<00:04:44.430> don't<00:04:44.550> want<00:04:44.729> to

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
to really go past F - you don't want to

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.230 
to really go past F - you don't want to
shoot<00:04:44.909> at<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.240> 8<00:04:45.449> or<00:04:45.770> 4<00:04:46.770> or<00:04:47.070> 5<00:04:47.310> 6<00:04:47.580> because<00:04:48.030> what

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
shoot at to 8 or 4 or 5 6 because what

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.820 
shoot at to 8 or 4 or 5 6 because what
will<00:04:48.330> happen<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.810> you'll<00:04:49.050> begin<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.530> start

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
will happen is you'll begin to start

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.180 
will happen is you'll begin to start
softening<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.849> image<00:04:51.110> so<00:04:52.110> let's<00:04:52.860> say<00:04:53.039> you're

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
softening the image so let's say you're

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.870 
softening the image so let's say you're
shooting<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.669> shooting<00:04:54.300> at<00:04:54.449> f/4<00:04:54.990> then<00:04:55.860> what<00:04:56.849> I

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
shooting it shooting at f/4 then what I

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.439 
shooting it shooting at f/4 then what I
found<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:58.050> want<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.320> match<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:59.030> D<00:05:00.030> focus

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
found is you want to match the D focus

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.779 
found is you want to match the D focus
control<00:05:00.780> ring<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.070> aperture<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.550> you're

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
control ring to the aperture that you're

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.189 
control ring to the aperture that you're
shooting<00:05:03.000> at<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.510> if<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.690> want<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:03.960> further

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
shooting at so if you want to further

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.170 
shooting at so if you want to further
blur<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.250> foreground<00:05:05.699> you're<00:05:06.000> going<00:05:06.120> to

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
blur the foreground you're going to

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.399 
blur the foreground you're going to
shoot<00:05:06.389> it<00:05:06.539> at<00:05:06.720> front<00:05:07.229> 4<00:05:07.590> or<00:05:07.940> rear<00:05:08.940> 4<00:05:09.360> or<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:09.930> can

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
shoot it at front 4 or rear 4 or you can

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.129 
shoot it at front 4 or rear 4 or you can
shoot<00:05:10.560> at<00:05:10.710> 2.8<00:05:11.310> or<00:05:11.520> also<00:05:11.820> up<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.510> anything<00:05:12.900> in

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
shoot at 2.8 or also up to anything in

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.629 
shoot at 2.8 or also up to anything in
between<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.650> range<00:05:13.919> but<00:05:14.099> if<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:14.340> start

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
between that range but if you start

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.149 
between that range but if you start
going<00:05:14.849> beyond<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:16.260> aperture<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:16.860> you're

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
going beyond the aperture that you're

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.680 
going beyond the aperture that you're
shooting<00:05:17.340> at<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:17.789> if<00:05:17.880> you're<00:05:18.000> shooting<00:05:18.210> an<00:05:18.270> f4

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
shooting at so if you're shooting an f4

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.920 
shooting at so if you're shooting an f4
and<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.440> push<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:19.979> 5.6<00:05:20.820> on<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.330> D<00:05:21.510> focus

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
and you push it to 5.6 on the D focus

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.080 
and you push it to 5.6 on the D focus
control<00:05:22.320> then<00:05:23.130> you'll<00:05:23.340> start<00:05:23.610> seeing<00:05:23.880> some

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
control then you'll start seeing some

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.770 
control then you'll start seeing some
shot<00:05:24.479> softness<00:05:25.199> in<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:26.180> your<00:05:27.180> focal<00:05:27.570> plane

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
shot softness in the your focal plane

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.980 
shot softness in the your focal plane
where<00:05:28.259> you<00:05:28.409> want<00:05:28.680> sharp<00:05:29.330> which<00:05:30.330> also<00:05:30.570> can<00:05:30.840> be

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
where you want sharp which also can be

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.390 
where you want sharp which also can be
really<00:05:31.139> cool<00:05:31.440> if<00:05:31.590> you're<00:05:31.680> trying<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:32.009> get<00:05:32.130> some

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
really cool if you're trying to get some

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.270 
really cool if you're trying to get some
soft<00:05:32.820> focus<00:05:33.090> effect<00:05:33.380> then<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.770> can<00:05:34.889> also<00:05:35.039> do

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
soft focus effect then you can also do

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.940 
soft focus effect then you can also do
that<00:05:35.430> as<00:05:35.550> well<00:05:35.789> so<00:05:36.060> that's<00:05:37.020> essentially<00:05:37.710> what

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
that as well so that's essentially what

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.339 
that as well so that's essentially what
it<00:05:38.099> allows<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.639> do<00:05:38.820> when<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.840> move<00:05:40.080> that

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
it allows you to do when you move that

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.529 
it allows you to do when you move that
when<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:40.860> when<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.550> move<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:41.940> D<00:05:42.150> focus

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
when you when you move the D focus

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:42.930 
when you when you move the D focus
control

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
control

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.190 
control
so<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:43.180> want<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.450> further<00:05:43.630> blur<00:05:43.990> the

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
so you want to further blur the

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.130 
so you want to further blur the
background<00:05:44.320> or<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.220> foreground<00:05:46.140> essentially

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
background or the foreground essentially

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.140 
background or the foreground essentially
when<00:05:47.290> you<00:05:47.410> further<00:05:47.680> blur<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.190> background<00:05:48.310> it

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
when you further blur the background it

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.810 
when you further blur the background it
sharpens<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.440> foreground<00:05:50.950> a<00:05:51.130> little<00:05:51.370> bit<00:05:51.550> so

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
sharpens the foreground a little bit so

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.730 
sharpens the foreground a little bit so
it's<00:05:52.030> kind<00:05:52.240> of<00:05:52.300> like<00:05:52.450> a<00:05:52.510> little<00:05:52.840> bit<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.140> a<00:05:53.440> give

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
it's kind of like a little bit of a give

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.950 
it's kind of like a little bit of a give
and<00:05:53.920> take<00:05:54.240> so<00:05:55.240> that's<00:05:55.420> what<00:05:55.600> makes<00:05:55.750> these

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
and take so that's what makes these

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.160 
and take so that's what makes these
lenses<00:05:56.350> so<00:05:56.620> unique<00:05:59.070> the<00:06:00.070> 135<00:06:00.790> f/2<00:06:01.450> DC<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.140> a

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
lenses so unique the 135 f/2 DC is a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.820 
lenses so unique the 135 f/2 DC is a
fantastic<00:06:03.130> lens<00:06:03.370> I<00:06:03.700> absolutely<00:06:04.060> love<00:06:04.420> mine

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
fantastic lens I absolutely love mine

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.990 
fantastic lens I absolutely love mine
Nikon<00:06:05.830> also<00:06:06.220> makes<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:06.760> 105<00:06:07.480> F<00:06:07.780> 2<00:06:08.020> DC<00:06:09.000> both

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
Nikon also makes a 105 F 2 DC both

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.090 
Nikon also makes a 105 F 2 DC both
lenses<00:06:10.270> were<00:06:10.600> made<00:06:10.840> in<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.230> mid<00:06:11.380> 90s<00:06:11.860> and

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
lenses were made in the mid 90s and

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.920 
lenses were made in the mid 90s and
actually<00:06:12.820> they're<00:06:13.000> still<00:06:13.210> producing<00:06:13.420> them

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
actually they're still producing them

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.070 
actually they're still producing them
today<00:06:14.640> over<00:06:15.640> there's<00:06:15.850> been<00:06:16.420> a<00:06:16.450> rumor<00:06:16.720> going

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
today over there's been a rumor going

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.290 
today over there's been a rumor going
around<00:06:17.230> that<00:06:17.680> in<00:06:17.980> the<00:06:18.130> last<00:06:18.430> two<00:06:19.030> three<00:06:19.270> years

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
around that in the last two three years

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.190 
around that in the last two three years
a<00:06:19.750> Nikon<00:06:20.740> may<00:06:22.260> update<00:06:23.260> the<00:06:23.620> 135<00:06:24.580> DC<00:06:25.060> to<00:06:25.420> a<00:06:25.450> 135

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
a Nikon may update the 135 DC to a 135

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.790 
a Nikon may update the 135 DC to a 135
1.8<00:06:26.950> but<00:06:27.250> without<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.790> D<00:06:27.970> focus<00:06:28.420> control<00:06:28.800> so

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
1.8 but without the D focus control so

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.530 
1.8 but without the D focus control so
if<00:06:29.920> that<00:06:30.100> were<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.340> happen<00:06:30.400> I<00:06:31.000> would<00:06:31.300> imagine

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
if that were to happen I would imagine

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.410 
if that were to happen I would imagine
this<00:06:32.500> lens

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
this lens

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.840 
this lens
the<00:06:35.350> price<00:06:35.590> of<00:06:35.620> this<00:06:35.860> lens<00:06:36.100> would<00:06:36.250> go<00:06:36.460> up<00:06:36.640> on

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
the price of this lens would go up on
