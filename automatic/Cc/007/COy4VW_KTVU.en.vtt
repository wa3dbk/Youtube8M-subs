that's<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.239> statistics<00:02:44.110> class<00:02:44.320> I'm

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
that's just the statistics class I'm

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.190 
that's just the statistics class I'm
taking<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:45.160> statistics<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:46.300> life<00:02:46.540> sciences

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
taking is statistics for life sciences

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.590 
taking is statistics for life sciences
so<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> lot<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.190> is<00:02:48.310> medical<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.510> not

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
so a lot of it is medical so it's not

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.180 
so a lot of it is medical so it's not
all<00:02:49.810> health<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.380> fitness<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:50.860> again<00:02:51.070> you
