think that's the case I actually think
what<00:03:17.310> Mark<00:03:17.580> Millar<00:03:17.790> did<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.060> red<00:03:18.240> skull<00:03:18.620> for

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
what Mark Millar did with red skull for

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.080 
what Mark Millar did with red skull for
the<00:03:19.680> ultimate<00:03:19.920> universe<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.310> genius

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the ultimate universe is genius

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.480 
the ultimate universe is genius
because<00:03:21.630> what<00:03:22.170> happens<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.770> turns<00:03:22.950> out<00:03:23.100> the

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
because what happens is it turns out the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.770 
because what happens is it turns out the
ultimate<00:03:23.760> red<00:03:23.880> skull<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.180> Captain<00:03:24.510> America's

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
ultimate red skull is Captain America's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830 
ultimate red skull is Captain America's
son<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:26.220> me<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.460> makes<00:03:26.640> total<00:03:26.910> sense<00:03:27.000> because

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
son to me this makes total sense because

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.660 
son to me this makes total sense because
we've<00:03:27.990> already<00:03:28.290> established<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:29.220> there<00:03:29.490> is

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
we've already established that there is

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.820

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
lucky and if he was stolen is probably

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.810 
lucky and if he was stolen is probably
enough<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.590> somehow<00:03:52.950> figure<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.640> way<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820

stuff<00:04:07.710> he<00:04:08.520> gives<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.850> cute<00:04:09.150> excuse<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> say

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
stuff he gives this cute excuse to say

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.710 
stuff he gives this cute excuse to say
well<00:04:10.170> he's<00:04:10.380> slower<00:04:11.250> aging<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.270> even<00:04:12.600> though

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
well he's slower aging so even though

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.060 
well he's slower aging so even though
he's<00:04:13.260> probably<00:04:13.290> around<00:04:14.010> 50<00:04:14.520> he<00:04:14.730> still<00:04:15.000> fit<00:04:17.810> and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.349 
he's probably around 50 he still fit and
it<00:04:20.070> gives<00:04:20.370> him<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.640> personal<00:04:20.970> connection<00:04:21.210> with

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359

it gives him a personal connection with
Captain<00:04:21.750> America<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:22.260> think<00:04:22.710> works<00:04:22.980> perfectly

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
Captain America I think works perfectly

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.350 
nightmares I think it's a bad diet or
whatever<00:04:47.680> Zico<00:04:48.070> son<00:04:48.310> is<00:04:49.950> weight<00:04:51.300> over<00:04:52.300> the

that<00:05:13.480> they're<00:05:13.840> there<00:05:14.200> buffer<00:05:14.620> in<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.890> for

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
that they're there buffer in it for

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.340 
that they're there buffer in it for
delays<00:05:16.000> cuz<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.510> trade<00:05:16.720> doesn't<00:05:16.990> come<00:05:17.110> out<00:05:17.170> so

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
delays cuz the trade doesn't come out so

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.870 
delays cuz the trade doesn't come out so
may<00:05:17.530> it's<00:05:17.740> only<00:05:17.890> six<00:05:18.160> issues<00:05:19.410> but<00:05:20.880> personally

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
may it's only six issues but personally

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.470 
may it's only six issues but personally
I've<00:05:22.090> really<00:05:22.570> enjoyed<00:05:22.660> this<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.140> far<00:05:24.480> I'm

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
I've really enjoyed this so far I'm

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.700 
I've really enjoyed this so far I'm
hoping<00:05:25.720> we<00:05:25.900> lose<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.110> couple<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.440> these<00:05:26.500> team

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
hoping we lose a couple of these team

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.290 
hoping we lose a couple of these team
members<00:05:27.010> because<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.400> don't<00:05:27.580> care<00:05:27.850> about<00:05:28.060> them

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
members because I don't care about them

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.390 
members because I don't care about them
like<00:05:29.140> I'm<00:05:29.290> okay<00:05:29.410> with<00:05:29.680> keeping<00:05:29.980> war<00:05:30.160> machine

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
like I'm okay with keeping war machine

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.380 
like I'm okay with keeping war machine
because<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.640> makes<00:05:30.820> sense<00:05:31.000> maybe<00:05:31.180> but<00:05:31.330> I'm

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
because that makes sense maybe but I'm

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.870 
because that makes sense maybe but I'm
hoping<00:05:31.570> we<00:05:31.690> lose<00:05:32.670> red<00:05:33.670> wasp<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:35.730> could<00:05:36.730> live

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
hoping we lose red wasp I could live

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.280 
hoping we lose red wasp I could live
without<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.270> new<00:05:37.390> Black<00:05:37.570> Widow<00:05:37.900> like<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.140> don't

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
without the new Black Widow like I don't

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.230 
without the new Black Widow like I don't
hate<00:05:38.530> her<00:05:38.680> but<00:05:38.860> she<00:05:39.160> just<00:05:39.340> seems<00:05:39.580> like<00:05:39.760> she's

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
hate her but she just seems like she's

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.350 
hate her but she just seems like she's
there<00:05:40.420> to<00:05:40.600> do<00:05:41.290> something<00:05:41.710> with<00:05:41.830> Nick<00:05:41.980> Fury<00:05:42.360> but

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
there to do something with Nick Fury but

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.530 
there to do something with Nick Fury but
so<00:05:43.570> far<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.750> really<00:05:43.780> enjoyed<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.350> series
