for your hitter down minecraft and it's

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.089 
for your hitter down minecraft and it's
how<00:00:07.330> to<00:00:07.389> break<00:00:07.630> bedrock<00:00:08.050> there's<00:00:08.800> many<00:00:09.010> ways

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099 
how to break bedrock there's many ways

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.789 
how to break bedrock there's many ways
to<00:00:09.250> do<00:00:09.490> it<00:00:09.519> now<00:00:09.730> so<00:00:09.969> this<00:00:10.089> is<00:00:10.240> just<00:00:10.419> another

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
to do it now so this is just another

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.140 
to do it now so this is just another
addition<00:00:11.799> to<00:00:11.950> how<00:00:12.099> to<00:00:12.160> break<00:00:12.519> another<00:00:12.669> set<00:00:13.059> of

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
addition to how to break another set of

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.549 
addition to how to break another set of
bedrock

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
bedrock

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.260 
bedrock
you<00:00:14.799> can't<00:00:15.039> pick<00:00:15.249> this<00:00:15.400> up<00:00:15.579> but<00:00:15.849> all<00:00:16.030> you<00:00:16.150> will

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
you can't pick this up but all you will

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.620 
you can't pick this up but all you will
need<00:00:16.360> to<00:00:16.510> do<00:00:16.690> this<00:00:16.900> is<00:00:17.280> a<00:00:18.280> stair<00:00:18.910> or<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.240> chest

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
need to do this is a stair or a chest

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.100 
need to do this is a stair or a chest
and<00:00:20.050> with<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:20.830> skeleton<00:00:21.340> schools<00:00:21.720> any<00:00:22.720> school

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
and with the skeleton schools any school

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.630 
and with the skeleton schools any school
will<00:00:23.260> work<00:00:23.440> it's<00:00:23.680> just<00:00:23.740> easiest<00:00:24.250> to<00:00:24.340> get<00:00:24.460> with

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
will work it's just easiest to get with

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.100 
will work it's just easiest to get with
a<00:00:24.670> skeleton<00:00:24.910> school<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.570> that's<00:00:25.930> why<00:00:26.050> I'm

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
a skeleton school so that's why I'm

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.830 
a skeleton school so that's why I'm
using<00:00:26.140> these<00:00:26.440> so<00:00:27.220> say<00:00:27.730> you're<00:00:27.940> on<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.390> bottom

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
using these so say you're on the bottom

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.750 
using these so say you're on the bottom
of<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.200> nether<00:00:29.650> or<00:00:29.950> bottom<00:00:30.190> of<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.400> overworld

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
of the nether or bottom of the overworld

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.369 
of the nether or bottom of the overworld
and<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.030> want<00:00:31.180> to<00:00:31.240> just<00:00:31.330> clear<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.990> bedrock

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
and you want to just clear the bedrock

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.169 
and you want to just clear the bedrock
but<00:00:32.710> you<00:00:32.800> can't<00:00:33.010> because<00:00:33.399> it's<00:00:33.879> unbreakable

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
but you can't because it's unbreakable

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.989 
but you can't because it's unbreakable
really<00:00:34.780> all<00:00:35.620> you<00:00:35.739> need<00:00:35.859> to<00:00:35.949> do<00:00:36.070> is<00:00:36.339> either<00:00:36.640> get

really all you need to do is either get

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.259 
really all you need to do is either get
your<00:00:37.239> chest<00:00:38.109> or<00:00:38.589> your<00:00:38.949> stair<00:00:39.339> or<00:00:39.370> use<00:00:39.760> both<00:00:39.999> to

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
your chest or your stair or use both to

your chest or your stair or use both to
show<00:00:40.449> you<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.800> just<00:00:41.920> want<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.129> get<00:00:42.219> your

show you and you just want to get your
wither<00:00:42.489> skeleton<00:00:42.879> to<00:00:42.940> school<00:00:43.179> and<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.749> want

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
wither skeleton to school and you want

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.180 
wither skeleton to school and you want
to<00:00:43.989> like<00:00:44.199> look<00:00:44.499> on<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.890> side<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:46.499> the<00:00:47.499> chest<00:00:47.829> so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
to like look on the side of the chest so

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.819 
to like look on the side of the chest so
if<00:00:48.999> I<00:00:49.120> look<00:00:49.659> here<00:00:49.929> it<00:00:50.170> will<00:00:50.289> destroy<00:00:50.620> this

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
if I look here it will destroy this

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.309 
if I look here it will destroy this
piece<00:00:51.069> of<00:00:51.249> bedrock<00:00:51.429> right<00:00:51.879> here<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.359> if<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.539> do

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
piece of bedrock right here so if I do

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.479 
piece of bedrock right here so if I do
it<00:00:53.379> now<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.559> look<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:53.949> side<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.280> then<00:00:54.399> you

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
it now you look on the side and then you

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.549 
it now you look on the side and then you
place<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.449> reverse<00:00:55.719> skeleton<00:00:56.079> school<00:00:56.289> and<00:00:56.469> it

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
place the reverse skeleton school and it

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.099 
place the reverse skeleton school and it
will<00:00:56.649> actually<00:00:56.769> just<00:00:56.949> delete<00:00:57.429> this<00:00:58.109> bedrock

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
will actually just delete this bedrock

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.540 
will actually just delete this bedrock
and<00:00:59.379> then<00:00:59.499> it's<00:00:59.679> gone<00:00:59.829> forever<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.219> can<00:01:00.339> walk

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
and then it's gone forever you can walk

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.450 
and then it's gone forever you can walk
in<00:01:00.729> it<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:01.389> just<00:01:01.629> gone<00:01:01.839> completely<00:01:02.139> now<00:01:02.499> and

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
in it it's just gone completely now and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.609 
in it it's just gone completely now and
if<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.670> did<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:03.879> on<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.269> side<00:01:04.540> then<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.320> would

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
if I did it on this side then it would

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.039 
if I did it on this side then it would
disappear<00:01:05.829> on<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.490> side<00:01:06.640> as<00:01:06.790> well<00:01:06.939> so<00:01:07.119> you

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
disappear on that side as well so you

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.480 
disappear on that side as well so you
just<00:01:08.200> need<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.380> basically<00:01:08.770> place<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:09.460> a

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
just need to basically place a with a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.670 
just need to basically place a with a
skeleton<00:01:09.729> school<00:01:10.149> to<00:01:10.659> destroy<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.320> bedrock

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
skeleton school to destroy the bedrock

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.429 
skeleton school to destroy the bedrock
and<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:13.299> is<00:01:13.450> really<00:01:13.719> good<00:01:13.960> because<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.320> can

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
and this is really good because you can

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.200 
and this is really good because you can
actually<00:01:14.799> do<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.159> break<00:01:15.430> through<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.030> roof

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
actually do it to break through the roof

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.050 
actually do it to break through the roof
of<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.840> nether<00:01:16.990> as<00:01:17.259> well<00:01:17.439> so<00:01:17.880> imagine<00:01:18.880> this

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
of the nether as well so imagine this

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.810 
of the nether as well so imagine this
piece<00:01:19.689> of<00:01:20.020> bedrock<00:01:20.409> right<00:01:20.829> here<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.579> roof

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
piece of bedrock right here is the roof

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.889 
piece of bedrock right here is the roof
to<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.090> nether<00:01:22.270> I'm<00:01:22.420> not<00:01:22.509> going<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.689> go<00:01:22.750> all

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
to the nether I'm not going to go all

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.120 
to the nether I'm not going to go all
the<00:01:22.930> way<00:01:23.049> up<00:01:23.259> I'm<00:01:23.530> just<00:01:23.680> going<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:23.920> show<00:01:24.070> you

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
the way up I'm just going to show you

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.039 
the way up I'm just going to show you
right<00:01:24.310> now<00:01:24.369> all<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.390> need<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.600> do<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.780> put<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
right now all you need to do is put the

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.929 
right now all you need to do is put the
staircase<00:01:26.590> down<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.399> just<00:01:27.520> need<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.789> look

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
staircase down and you just need to look

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.240 
staircase down and you just need to look
inside<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.780> staircase<00:01:29.619> right<00:01:29.829> here<00:01:30.100> and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
inside the staircase right here and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.359 
inside the staircase right here and
place<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.539> school<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.289> as<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:32.740> can<00:01:32.890> see<00:01:33.100> it

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
place the school and as you can see it

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.160 
place the school and as you can see it
will<00:01:33.460> destroy<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.090> bedrock<00:01:34.450> layer<00:01:34.630> above<00:01:34.990> it

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
will destroy the bedrock layer above it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.340 
will destroy the bedrock layer above it
so<00:01:35.829> you<00:01:35.920> just<00:01:36.039> need<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.310> basically<00:01:37.060> put<00:01:37.780> a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
so you just need to basically put a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.310 
so you just need to basically put a
staircase<00:01:39.039> underneath<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.149> bedrock<00:01:40.509> go<00:01:41.170> to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
staircase underneath the bedrock go to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.990 
staircase underneath the bedrock go to
and<00:01:41.649> place<00:01:41.859> the<00:01:42.009> school<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.490> then<00:01:42.670> you've<00:01:42.850> got

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and place the school and then you've got

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.620 
and place the school and then you've got
a<00:01:43.030> hole<00:01:43.299> in<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.840> roof<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.320> nether<00:01:44.500> or

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
a hole in the roof of the nether or

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.580 
a hole in the roof of the nether or
whatever<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.750> need<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:46.899> break<00:01:47.170> bedrock

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
whatever you need to break bedrock

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.490 
whatever you need to break bedrock
really<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.939> can<00:01:49.060> also<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.259> can

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
really and you can also I know you can

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.289 
really and you can also I know you can
only<00:01:50.590> do<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.100> way<00:01:51.369> if<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:52.000> want<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.179> like

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
only do it this way if you want to like

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.969 
only do it this way if you want to like
break<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.780> sides<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.829> use<00:01:53.950> a

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
break the sides and you have to use a

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.459 
break the sides and you have to use a
chest<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.909> can't<00:01:55.149> do<00:01:55.329> it<00:01:55.420> anyway<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.229> got<00:01:56.409> to

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
chest you can't do it anyway you got to

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.289 
chest you can't do it anyway you got to
do<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.090> basically

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
do it like that so that is basically

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.359 
do it like that so that is basically
just<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.929> nice<00:01:59.140> quick<00:01:59.560> simple<00:01:59.950> trick<00:02:00.100> debate

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
just a nice quick simple trick debate

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.819 
just a nice quick simple trick debate
