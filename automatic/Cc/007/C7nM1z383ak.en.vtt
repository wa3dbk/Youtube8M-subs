Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today in the PcT Test Lab, we are

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.780
testing Ranger’s Glossy Accents on Polymer
clay.Now, those of you who’ve been around...you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.840
now know that I like to test different products
and see how they are compatible with Polymer

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.310
clay, and we are testing the Ranger’s Glossy
Accents… which is generally used in scrapbooking

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.800
and that type of thing, but it is a clear
dimensional medium.Now, I’ve got a sample

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.899
here, I’ve got a piece of baked Premo clay
that had a bit of a Gold leaf texture…or

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.359
Gold leaf added to it, and I thought I’d
put this finish on it, and as you can see,

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.910
it is very glossy and we did it…

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.199
I did it back...let’s see, in January…at
the beginning of January, so it’s been more

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.840
than a couple of months, and so we know that
that’s enough time to know whether it’s

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600
compatible or not.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.220
And I put two coats on, and so you can see
that it is fairly thick, but if you put a…

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.710
you could put an even thicker layer on if
you wanted it to dome on anything that was

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.550
sort of textured or not.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.030
It is flexible, it won’t chip or peel or
anything, and after that amount of time, I

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.770
can see that it is not sticky or anything,
so it is compatible.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.930
Now, it is very similar, in my opinion, to
the product we tested a little while ago called

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.250
the Aleene’s Jewelry Pendant Gel, it is
the same kind of flexibility, the same kind

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.350
of shine to it, it does a similar thing…
like if you’ve pressed your fingernail into

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.829
it you can leave a dent in it, but over a
little bit of time, it seems to work its way

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.410
out, so it’s kind of a semi-flexible type
thing, it doesn’t seem to scratch up too

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.350
much or anything so it looks like it’s going
to be a good product for Polymer clay.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.820
Price wise…okay here in Canada our prices
are a little different, but this was about

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:22.640
$11 at Michaels, and this is about $8, I believe,
in the states, it’s about $8 for the Aleene’s

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.950
and $5 for the Glossy Accents, there’s 4
ounces in the Aleene’s, and 2 ounces here,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:38.130
so it really depends on which you think is
a better deal…volume wise, the Aleene’s

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.580
is a better deal, but you might not be able
to find it as easily as the Glossy Accents,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.410
and you may not need as much of it, so it’s
really up to you, I’m finding them to be

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.640
very, very similar products.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.090
Now, as far as using it, what you do is just
squeeze it out of the bottle here, it goes…

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.480
it’s fairly clear to start off with, it’s
very similar to the Aleene’s as far as...it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.610
looks slightly milky but not too much, you
go around the edge of your project and then

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.610
fill it in.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.500
Now, depending on your thickness that you
put it on...will depend on how quickly it

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.040
dries and how domed it looks, but you can
put it on quite thick it’s meant for that.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.700
Now as far as any bubbles or things like that,
you can use a little pin and pop them, or

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.130
drag them out to the edge.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.160
I like to always use a pin when I’m putting
a finish on like this.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.790
‘cause then I can drag it right out to the
edges, to make sure that it’s going all

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.900
the way around quite nicely, I’d spend a
little bit more time on it than that, and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.350
then you just let it dry…just check for
little bubbles, that kind of thing, it doesn’t

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.070
seem to pull away from the edges or anything
like that, which is a good thing.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.590
And what I would do is let it sit, over…
24hrs at least before you start messing around

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.730
with it, and because it’s a wet surface,
what I suggest is… whenever you’re doing

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.180
anything with a finish on a piece, just put
a little lid over it so that you’re not

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.070
letting dust settle on to the wet surface
and then staying there forever.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.030
So I hope that was helpful for you, if it
was, please let us know if you like this video.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.350
And if you have a suggestion for a product
you’d like me to test in the PcT Test Lab,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.870
make sure to leave those in the comment section
below.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.130
And if you have any other suggestions for
videos that you’d like me to share with

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.040
you, I’d love to hear from you.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.120
So we’ll see you next time and bye for now.
