00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is that they are building a huge

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.440 
is that they are building a huge
underground<00:00:33.739> top-secret<00:00:34.739> bunker<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
underground top-secret bunker which is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.440 
underground top-secret bunker which is
to<00:00:36.780> allow<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> government<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.160> operate<00:00:38.450> in

have<00:00:47.730> now<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> something<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.649> could

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
have now which is something that could

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290 
have now which is something that could
not<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.789> could<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.120> withstand

not be that could not withstand

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.049 
not be that could not withstand
withstand<00:00:52.230> any<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> attack

of all just looking at the size of it

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.910 
of all just looking at the size of it
you<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:25.120> tell<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.230> for<00:02:26.410> utilities

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
you can tell it's not just for utilities

but secondly you know there will be

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.200 
but secondly you know there will be
relocation<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.400> utilities<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.000> they're<00:02:31.120> not

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
relocation of utilities so they're not

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.190 
relocation of utilities so they're not
totally<00:02:31.930> lying<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> really
