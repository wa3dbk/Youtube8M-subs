this<00:00:24.460> is<00:00:24.609> a<00:00:24.640> piece<00:00:25.119> of<00:00:25.330> aluminum<00:00:26.170> that's<00:00:26.350> been

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
this is a piece of aluminum that's been

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.950 
this is a piece of aluminum that's been
held<00:00:26.740> together<00:00:26.859> with<00:00:27.160> three<00:00:28.000> M's<00:00:28.210> marine

held together with three M's marine
silicone<00:00:29.500> rubber<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.699> what<00:00:31.000> we're<00:00:31.119> gonna<00:00:31.210> do

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
silicone rubber and what we're gonna do

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.319 
silicone rubber and what we're gonna do
is<00:00:31.660> score<00:00:32.019> it<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.440> we're<00:00:38.559> gonna<00:00:38.710> spray<00:00:39.329> marine

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
formula on both sides

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.680 
formula on both sides
and<00:00:45.040> we'll<00:00:45.129> let<00:00:45.250> it<00:00:45.399> sit<00:00:45.640> up<00:00:45.730> for<00:00:45.969> a<00:00:46.239> couple

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
and we'll let it sit up for a couple

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
and we'll let it sit up for a couple
minutes

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

formula can do is remove Sharpie pen and
this<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.120> just<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.370> residue<00:00:57.879> that's<00:00:58.510> on<00:00:58.809> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
this is just the residue that's on the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
wedge we'll put it in between a silicone

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.130 
wedge we'll put it in between a silicone
rubber<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:12.270> lift<00:01:13.270> right<00:01:13.599> off<00:01:13.649> really<00:01:14.649> clean
