00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
ocean and I thought to myself this is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.480 
ocean and I thought to myself this is
actually<00:02:56.510> true<00:02:56.540> healing<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.980> was<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
actually true healing it was just the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.790 
actually true healing it was just the
most<00:02:58.640> expansive<00:02:59.000> experience<00:02:59.870> tears<00:03:00.470> came<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
most expansive experience tears came to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.790 
most expansive experience tears came to
my<00:03:00.950> eyes<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.430> they<00:03:01.490> almost<00:03:01.670> are<00:03:01.970> right<00:03:02.240> now

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
my eyes and they almost are right now

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.380 
my eyes and they almost are right now
but<00:03:03.800> just<00:03:04.010> don't<00:03:04.220> much<00:03:04.430> appreciation<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
but just don't much appreciation that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.180 
but just don't much appreciation that
