00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to start with the braids so you start

to start with the braids so you start
from<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.930> side<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.410> hair<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
from one side of your hair so if you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.780 
from one side of your hair so if you
take<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.090> side<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.930> three<00:01:04.470> sections<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
take one side into three sections to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.140 
take one side into three sections to
braid<00:01:07.130> away<00:01:08.130> from<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.580> face

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
braid away from your face

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.539 
braid away from your face
and<00:01:09.600> always<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.010> done<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.430> many

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and always this can be done in so many

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
and always this can be done in so many
different<00:01:11.729> types<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.330> braids<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.840> think

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
different types of braids but I think

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
different types of braids but I think
I'm<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> stick<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> easy<00:01:14.700> one

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I'm just going to stick to the easy one

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.950 
I'm just going to stick to the easy one
so<00:01:15.259> it<00:01:16.259> looks<00:01:16.439> something<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.960> then

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so it looks something like this and then

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.399 
so it looks something like this and then
just<00:01:18.990> keep<00:01:19.409> braiding<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> pin<00:01:21.409> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
just keep braiding and then you pin just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.760 
just keep braiding and then you pin just
at<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> bottom<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.280> hair<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.759> that
