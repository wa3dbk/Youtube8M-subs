00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.750
 today 4% of French left edf for new suppliers 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.379
 of electricity and some made 35 singers new contract their 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.400
 would cost more is the case of benoit and we'll see why he has 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.609
 left paradise the regulated tariffs 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.609
 ap hello 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.589
 Benoît and give a little color to his electrical appliances 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.090
 yes he has subscribed to an electricity contract rte 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.029
 mean by that 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.850
 if all the users they consume 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.830
 problem 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.880
 renewable 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.860
 electricity and that saves struggling it's really existed green 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.070
 by this green electricity it is no longer the world 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.530
 but for me to have a contract with the mark by daniele know what other end 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.850
 of the electricity network 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.390
 there are renewable electricity producers that will produce 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.610
 the equivalent of consumption the site of private donations 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.110
 it is producing electricity through wind turbines or panels 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.080
 solar costs more than thanks to a nuclear power plant 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.740
 Benoît's bill is therefore the most ecological but less economical 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.490
 so there your very beautiful schedule you scatter 540 euros per year for 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.530
 abound the first 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 so I'm a little over 400 deaths a year 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.980
 1 the good alternative for me too to save energy for not 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.130
 pay its 540 euros i think in five years percent of my tariff here 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.220
 electricity will be cheaper than the rate includes three hours in general 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 in France 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.730
 it is benoît think to get a competitive price it is not because the 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.690
 offices des gargotes are very small because it's a society 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.190
 cooperative of collective interest 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.820
 three thousand and five hundred members are not there to garner 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.609
 record profits general meetings to decide 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.510
 the refinement to succeed all the profits so we do not give the project 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.860
 so it's logically his head the heroes 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.270
 it's ultimately the goal is to get 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.540
 electricity at a fair and transparent price 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.490
 so it's not 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 the goal of the company is not lucrative 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.240
 that's for the intentions but let's see concretely what is this 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.880
 gives in production for the Serbian 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 for example 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.990
 you have a season that the first site marco tardelli champagne so in 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 photovoltaic the few convoy balloons will not surprise much 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.540
 for now thirty square meters anyway that's the equivalent 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.009
 of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.739
 of focus we will say 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.099
 the names it's a start for us in the ardennes but at the national level and 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.439
 mercor% go means of production of 70 homes 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.429
 created in 2005 was yesterday when we are in the beginning but not a style 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.979
 like here in a wind turbine project that should see the light of day a year from now 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.139
 project with us 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.779
 much relied on smaller machines are to respect the 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.179
 distances 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:33.499
 that means we stay on other machines 8 5% to 10% is too long 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.709
 - 3 4 million euros investments to emerge 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.069
 but there are limits but power could produce clean after a 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.049
 half-season poor households 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.739
 we cover our activity 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.099
 she 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.000
 the idea is always to raise the share of green electricity on the network 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.379
 other proposed measures 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.189
 equal cries green city 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.109
 through the purchase of green certificates 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.039
 we really have 100% renewable electricity production and the 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.700
 recommendations of net purchases on the network as much green electricity 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.710
 that you consume 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.580
 other providers offers you contracts allows jesters strong 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.530
 electricity 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.889
 chris pine city 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.199
 how it works 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.209
 in addition to selling their green electricity some producers can sell 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.579
 to a green certificate a document which notifies that they are well put of 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.019
 green electricity on the rest 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.589
 your gray electricity provider has again 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.329
 chris huhne energy 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.399
 and buy certificates 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.319
 in order to undermine the good conscience 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.520
 but the lyonnais 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.520
 more electricity to the network 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.269
 whatever its color foot electricity produced in France with the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.190
 China Laos 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.919
 obtaining 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.150
 the place of production the farthest consumers the losses 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.520
 online are important goal to help hitting too 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.030
 to decentralize production and therefore to have many production sites 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.620
 more locally distributed throughout the territory to avoid the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.980
 transportation is avoiding transportation and cost decreases losses 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.329
 even 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.180
 he now at our neighbors the Belgians are going to see an experiment 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 similar 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.759
 biya 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.239
 but we too 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.329
 hatched in belgium and the rest there are no regulated tariffs that's the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.419
 hard law of the prevailing market but if least expensive electricity and 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.449
 100% renewable 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.370
 created in 1991 and coconut with a record twin fiscal pole for the most 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.889
 age 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.580
 today this professor of electricity was shot in a 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.729
 fifteen wind turbines from its solar installation or from 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.610
 small hydroelectric plants 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.770
 it thus provides power for 5000 customers they are also shareholder of 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.529
 this citizen cooperative 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.209
 customers at home will be both investors and customers it's 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.220
 that makes it yes to the US the competent and fo 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.100
 to buy 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.570
 an action of 250 kilos and right now 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.999
 I complete 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.539
 at the property of a centimeter tamino link he no longer buy a good 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.539
 price the green electricity that is produced 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.269
 in this area of ​​shops and offices for example heating and 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:14.930
 electricity are provided through solar panels 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.930
 they mistakenly consider themselves operating she lives rapeseed 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.800
 for defense m percent thousand euros to emulators the newspapers 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.909
 for now chips with a very small supplier in flanders it feeds 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.740
 of 1% of the population and yet the list waited more than six months 

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:36.259
 to introduce a grandstand the big trees on the lowest prices of the 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.940
 market and profits that comes 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.240
 but these projects 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.790
 it seems like the drama 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.710
 therefore not be complacent in the form of maximum dividends to the 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.749
 suspension 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.210
 and other benefits 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.910
 20 in the country and the arms 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.910
 because to pump water are sinecure 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.640
 viviane artigalas are very trendy renewable energies but as it does not 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.389
 do not always 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.190
 montpellier 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.139
 their solar panels are not enough for them 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.849
 five years ago one must be wary of the depths first by conviction 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.050
 ecology 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.560
 and while rebels and loyalists they will be at the helm and almost 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.680
 as much in the street is dirty sc apart from his friends we recognize having 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.039
 she was passing her excesses she comes and in this case complete 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.819
 contribute to the cleanliness and its member states that are not 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.819
 needed every day we would accept it 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.750
 the electric at the cafetière the city of our consoles so 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.389
 the hit and run 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.349
 he brings the best 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.629
 over a year ago compared to the old bills you compared 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.970
 between the colored bricks when comparing the two clubs 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:46.490
 the 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.990
 why is that 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.300
 a difference of more or less 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.950
 the woman position among the cheapest now I would like you miss 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.099
 she is trying green energy the sound 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:06:59.569
 m also every purpose 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.529
 a dividend 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.529
 more or less precise 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:08.679
 with others and the future elimination of the regulated tariff in France 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:12.259
 change for renewable electricity could possibly 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:12.460
 more
