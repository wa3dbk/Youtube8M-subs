nobody<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.610> audio<00:06:22.819> pack<00:06:23.060> got<00:06:23.330> back<00:06:23.569> out<00:06:23.919> um<00:06:24.919> I

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
nobody the audio pack got back out um I

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.309 
nobody the audio pack got back out um I
don't<00:06:25.759> think<00:06:26.090> the<00:06:26.330> in<00:06:26.479> the<00:06:26.569> same<00:06:26.780> same<00:06:27.110> days

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
don't think the in the same same days

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.640 
don't think the in the same same days
because<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.949> think<00:06:28.909> it<00:06:29.300> would<00:06:29.479> split<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.110> paper

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
because I think it would split the paper

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.730 
because I think it would split the paper
movie<00:06:31.159> is<00:06:31.520> so<00:06:31.789> big<00:06:32.030> they<00:06:32.479> both<00:06:32.659> so<00:06:32.930> big<00:06:33.199> I<00:06:33.500> I

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
movie is so big they both so big I I

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.110 
movie is so big they both so big I I
don't<00:06:34.189> think<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:34.460> would<00:06:34.610> happen<00:06:34.849> I<00:06:35.090> think

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
don't think that would happen I think

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.510 
don't think that would happen I think
they<00:06:35.419> would<00:06:35.569> separate<00:06:35.960> them<00:06:36.370> yeah<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.400> think

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
they would separate them yeah I think

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.670 
they would separate them yeah I think
that<00:06:37.789> that's<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.810> rule<00:06:38.960> you<00:06:39.439> know<00:06:39.529> what

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
that that's the rule you know what

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.689 
that that's the rule you know what
everyone<00:06:40.009> thinks<00:06:40.159> is<00:06:40.310> really<00:06:40.550> going<00:06:40.639> to

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
everyone thinks is really going to

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.850 
everyone thinks is really going to
happen<00:06:40.849> they've<00:06:41.120> got<00:06:41.300> but<00:06:41.629> and<00:06:41.840> if<00:06:42.199> it's<00:06:42.680> pack

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
happen they've got but and if it's pack

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.529 
happen they've got but and if it's pack
llame<00:06:43.340> whether<00:06:43.580> that's<00:06:44.000> going<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:44.270> get<00:06:44.389> the

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
llame whether that's going to get the

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.939 
llame whether that's going to get the
date<00:06:44.750> presumably<00:06:46.810> but<00:06:47.810> if<00:06:47.930> they're<00:06:48.139> close<00:06:48.560> I

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
date presumably but if they're close I

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.339 
date presumably but if they're close I
mean<00:06:49.129> it<00:06:49.490> can<00:06:49.849> you<00:06:50.029> jointly<00:06:50.750> train<00:06:51.110> them<00:06:51.319> and

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
mean it can you jointly train them and

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.399 
mean it can you jointly train them and
at<00:06:51.650> during<00:06:51.919> the<00:06:52.009> same<00:06:52.189> period<00:06:53.169> separately<00:06:54.169> as

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
at during the same period separately as

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:57.279 
at during the same period separately as
to<00:06:54.680> I<00:06:54.710> would<00:06:55.610> just<00:06:55.789> run<00:06:55.939> to<00:06:56.150> two<00:06:56.870> separate

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
to I would just run to two separate

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.550 
to I would just run to two separate
camps<00:06:57.740> and<00:06:58.389> keep<00:06:59.389> them<00:06:59.629> away<00:07:00.080> from<00:07:00.110> each<00:07:00.379> other

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.969 
camps and keep them away from each other
even<00:07:01.099> though<00:07:01.520> their<00:07:02.360> friends<00:07:02.870> say<00:07:03.020> they<00:07:03.050> like

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
even though their friends say they like
