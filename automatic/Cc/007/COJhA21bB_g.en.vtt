00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.060
 good friends of hdblog no is not this lg 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.320
 flex to make bad videos but it's mine 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.080
 pseudo-artistic shooting in full hd at 30 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 frames per second 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's try to do now is usually a fan 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.410
 fast on the road finally a day 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.420
 let's try now with the zoom between 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.960
 the other I activated the audio zoom then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.340
 should change the audio perception 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 doing this zoom in we go back 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.579
 now it has turned off the audio zoom and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.410
 since the terminal is important not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.180
 just because the first terminal is curved but 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.510
 also because it costs 900 euros 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.840
 here we do a complete test e 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.079
 of we enter here we are in silence in one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.350
 very very dark area boxes of the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.350
 mail ready to the elevator 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 ok we head to the floor and if 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 we see the adaptation to lights a lot 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.610
 low because notoriously in the lift a 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 a faint light 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.909
 here is this lighting 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 here the video buttons can 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 be recorded even in ultra hd 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.670
 as well as 1080p but 60 frames per 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 second, however, at 60 frames per second not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 you can activate the stabilization that is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 digital and in this case it was 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 activated you can also register 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.960
 videos in videos with the stamp label 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.659
 from the front or rear camera 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.560
 or vice versa it is also possible to do i 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.939
 video with a zoom box 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.860
 situation is nice that it could be 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.930
 useful certain situations we are 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.250
 arrived the door is opening serves 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.759
 invaded by light 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.799
 we see the adaptation to the new lights e 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.130
 also the color calibration is six 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.820
 fast it takes a little and last 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.720
 the sun full sun today in Milan 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.720
 miracle in Milan
