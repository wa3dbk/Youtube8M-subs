hi guys bishop butters here here with a

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.160 
hi guys bishop butters here here with a
quick<00:00:20.260> demonstration<00:00:20.470> video<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.840> is<00:00:23.020> the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
quick demonstration video this is the

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.630 
quick demonstration video this is the
this<00:00:23.800> is<00:00:24.420> 32<00:00:25.560> dark<00:00:26.560> matter<00:00:26.770> pedestals<00:00:27.340> all

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
this is 32 dark matter pedestals all

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.970 
this is 32 dark matter pedestals all
with<00:00:28.210> fully<00:00:28.510> charged<00:00:28.869> watches<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.590> flowing

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
with fully charged watches the flowing

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.869 
with fully charged watches the flowing
time<00:00:30.400> all<00:00:30.760> activated<00:00:31.570> at<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.990> same<00:00:32.230> time<00:00:32.879> this

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
time all activated at the same time this

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.340 
time all activated at the same time this
is<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.120> maximum<00:00:34.629> amount<00:00:34.720> you<00:00:34.989> can<00:00:35.110> have

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
is the maximum amount you can have

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.780 
is the maximum amount you can have
stacked<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:36.280> gives<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.850> global<00:00:38.400> 1000<00:00:39.400> time

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
stacked this gives a global 1000 time

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.000 
stacked this gives a global 1000 time
machine<00:00:40.510> speed<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.910> can<00:00:43.059> see<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.800> is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
machine speed as you can see this is

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.610 
machine speed as you can see this is
just<00:00:45.040> going<00:00:45.370> crazy<00:00:45.640> it's<00:00:46.030> not<00:00:46.210> even<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.840> good

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
just going crazy it's not even a good

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.180 
just going crazy it's not even a good
way<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.890> scale<00:00:48.280> on<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.610> rate<00:00:49.030> of<00:00:49.059> EMC<00:00:49.930> per<00:00:50.230> second

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
way to scale on a rate of EMC per second

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.850 
way to scale on a rate of EMC per second
on<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.370> rate<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.790> thousand<00:00:52.329> it<00:00:52.870> looks<00:00:53.500> like

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
on a rate of a thousand it looks like

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.369 
on a rate of a thousand it looks like
you<00:00:54.160> get<00:00:54.460> about<00:00:55.260> 10,000<00:00:56.260> EMC<00:00:57.120> every<00:00:58.379> few

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
you get about 10,000 EMC every few

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.990 
you get about 10,000 EMC every few
second<00:00:59.860> like<00:01:00.010> let's<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:01.000> um<00:01:01.360> I'd<00:01:01.870> say<00:01:03.000> 10,000

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
second like let's see um I'd say 10,000

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.139 
second like let's see um I'd say 10,000
EMC<00:01:04.800> every<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.030> half<00:01:07.060> seconds<00:01:09.149> maybe

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
EMC every one and a half seconds maybe

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.840 
EMC every one and a half seconds maybe
every<00:01:10.479> two<00:01:10.509> seconds<00:01:11.110> so<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.380> about<00:01:11.850> 5,000

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
every two seconds so it's about 5,000

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.469 
every two seconds so it's about 5,000
EMC<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> second<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.009> fully<00:01:15.460> with<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.940> fully

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
EMC a second with a fully with a fully

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.910 
EMC a second with a fully with a fully
optimized<00:01:16.869> flower<00:01:17.290> all<00:01:17.619> mark<00:01:17.920> three<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.470> if

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
optimized flower all mark three so if

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.730 
optimized flower all mark three so if
you<00:01:21.070> can<00:01:21.250> afford<00:01:21.479> 32<00:01:22.479> dark<00:01:22.900> matter<00:01:23.140> pedestals

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
you can afford 32 dark matter pedestals

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.359 
you can afford 32 dark matter pedestals
and<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.340> can<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.720> patience<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.170> make<00:01:26.560> 32

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
and you can have the patience to make 32

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.830 
and you can have the patience to make 32
watches<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:28.090> flowing<00:01:28.450> time<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:30.490> yeah<00:01:31.090> make

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
watches of flowing time then yeah make

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.800 
watches of flowing time then yeah make
sure<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.409> that<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:33.610> its<00:01:34.090> global<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:34.750> you

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
sure you do that also its global so you

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.030 
sure you do that also its global so you
don't<00:01:34.960> need<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.200> have<00:01:35.290> like<00:01:35.439> thirty<00:01:35.860> two

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
don't need to have like thirty two

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.590 
don't need to have like thirty two
pedestals<00:01:36.280> over<00:01:36.640> here<00:01:36.970> its<00:01:37.479> tax<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.680> it's<00:01:39.340> for

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pedestals over here its tax it it's for

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.490 
pedestals over here its tax it it's for
everything<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.189> just<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.290> first

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
everything it is just this the first

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.429 
everything it is just this the first
time<00:01:44.619> I've<00:01:44.770> actually<00:01:44.860> tried<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:46.439> it's

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
time I've actually tried it and it's

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.730 
time I've actually tried it and it's
just<00:01:47.590> ridiculous<00:01:48.159> now<00:01:48.990> okay<00:01:49.990> let's<00:01:50.560> see

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
just ridiculous now okay let's see

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.289 
just ridiculous now okay let's see
combined<00:01:51.549> with<00:01:51.700> somnia<00:01:52.150> I'm<00:01:52.390> at<00:01:53.490> seven<00:01:54.490> let's

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
combined with somnia I'm at seven let's

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.510 
combined with somnia I'm at seven let's
just<00:01:55.630> say<00:01:55.810> I'm<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.200> hundred<00:01:56.979> eighty<00:01:57.130> thousand

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
just say I'm a hundred eighty thousand

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.190 
just say I'm a hundred eighty thousand
DMC<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.430> only<00:02:00.610> problem<00:02:00.880> with<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.479> take<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
DMC the only problem with this is take a

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.510 
DMC the only problem with this is take a
look<00:02:02.439> how<00:02:02.590> slowly<00:02:02.860> it's<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.369> make

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
look how slowly it's going to make

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.539 
look how slowly it's going to make
somnia<00:02:04.479> go<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:05.079> is<00:02:05.259> set<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.680> peaceful<00:02:06.220> right

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
somnia go this is set to peaceful right

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.520 
somnia go this is set to peaceful right
now<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:07.570> if<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.899> had<00:02:08.079> this<00:02:08.290> set<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.829> say<00:02:10.530> normal

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
now so if I had this set to say normal

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.680 
now so if I had this set to say normal
or<00:02:11.650> hard<00:02:11.860> I'd<00:02:12.640> probably<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.060> wait<00:02:13.209> about<00:02:13.299> two

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
or hard I'd probably to wait about two

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.680 
or hard I'd probably to wait about two
maybe<00:02:14.380> even<00:02:14.560> three<00:02:14.860> minutes<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.760> it's

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
maybe even three minutes for this it's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.580 
maybe even three minutes for this it's
simulating<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.650> much<00:02:17.920> stuff<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:19.510> only<00:02:20.470> going

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
simulating so much stuff it's only going

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.559 
simulating so much stuff it's only going
at<00:02:20.770> about<00:02:20.920> two<00:02:21.160> or<00:02:21.430> three<00:02:21.640> times<00:02:21.819> normal<00:02:22.030> speed

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.300 

I<00:02:24.629> haven't<00:02:24.930> tried<00:02:25.049> actually<00:02:25.469> using<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.129> watch

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
I haven't tried actually using a watch

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.130 
I haven't tried actually using a watch
of<00:02:26.340> flowing<00:02:26.790> time<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.150> increase<00:02:27.390> time<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
of flowing time to increase time and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.860 
of flowing time to increase time and
then<00:02:28.620> sleeping<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.219> bed<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.870> might

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
then sleeping in a bed that might

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.890 
then sleeping in a bed that might
actually<00:02:30.989> crash<00:02:31.439> it<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:31.829> not<00:02:31.950> sure<00:02:32.900> might

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
actually crash it I'm not sure might

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:45.860 
actually crash it I'm not sure might
actually<00:02:34.019> try<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.530> soon<00:02:34.769> oh<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.540> boring

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
actually try that soon oh this is boring

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
actually try that soon oh this is boring
starting<00:02:46.469> us<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.859> screen<00:02:48.829> hmm<00:02:49.829> i<00:02:50.040> think

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
starting us on the screen hmm i think

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.649 
starting us on the screen hmm i think
what<00:02:50.879> i'm<00:02:50.969> gonna<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.209> i'm<00:02:51.329> going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.569> give

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
now fully charged and time speed is

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.770 
now fully charged and time speed is
forward<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.230> let's<00:03:28.409> see<00:03:28.560> oh<00:03:29.449> definitely<00:03:30.449> not

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
forward so let's see oh definitely not

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.339

no<00:03:30.989> no<00:03:31.139> no<00:03:31.259> no<00:03:31.409> do<00:03:32.359> let<00:03:33.359> me<00:03:33.449> try<00:03:33.659> d<00:03:33.750> charging<00:03:34.259> it

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
no no no no do let me try d charging it

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.619 
no no no no do let me try d charging it
because<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:36.000> actually<00:03:36.299> free<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.509> use

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
because the that's actually free to use

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.979 
because the that's actually free to use
it<00:03:37.519> goes<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.549> little<00:03:38.729> faster<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.389> not<00:03:39.569> by<00:03:39.780> much

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
it goes a little faster but not by much

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.300 
it goes a little faster but not by much
so<00:03:40.349> I<00:03:40.909> want<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:42.000> create<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.269> mode<00:03:42.449> to<00:03:42.540> do<00:03:42.659> that<00:03:42.810> so

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
so I want to create a mode to do that so

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.330 
so I want to create a mode to do that so
yeah<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.489> you're<00:03:44.639> using<00:03:44.819> somnia<00:03:45.449> to<00:03:45.689> do<00:03:45.810> this

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
yeah if you're using somnia to do this

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.800 
yeah if you're using somnia to do this
be<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.489> her<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.669> wait<00:03:47.939> out<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> somnia<00:03:48.569> screen

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
be for her to wait out the somnia screen

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.979 
be for her to wait out the somnia screen
for<00:03:49.109> about<00:03:49.259> two<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.530> three<00:03:49.739> minutes<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.870> if

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
for about two to three minutes but if

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.800 
for about two to three minutes but if
you're<00:03:52.109> not<00:03:52.259> using<00:03:52.500> somnia<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.189> do<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.810> and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you're not using somnia to do this and

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.149 
you're not using somnia to do this and
you're<00:03:55.019> just<00:03:55.139> walking<00:03:55.379> away<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.799> coming<00:03:55.949> back

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
you're just walking away and coming back

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.089 
you're just walking away and coming back
this<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.540> arguably<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.500> most<00:03:58.530> effective

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
this is arguably the most effective

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.110 
this is arguably the most effective

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
method so I'm going to cut out the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.679 
method so I'm going to cut out the
somnia<00:04:00.659> screen<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.079> guys<00:04:01.669> five<00:04:02.689> four
