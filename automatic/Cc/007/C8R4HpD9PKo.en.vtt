00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and using piping tip 68 we're going to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.779 
and using piping tip 68 we're going to
create<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.430> leaves<00:01:24.649> and<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.579> has

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
a ridge in the center which will give

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.819 
a ridge in the center which will give
you<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.729> leaf<00:01:30.299> effect<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:34.649> show

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
