so here let's just go ahead we're gonna

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.720 
so here let's just go ahead we're gonna
we<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> start<00:00:37.230> screen<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> play

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
we got a start screen here with a play

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.709 
we got a start screen here with a play
but<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.120> something<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.450> ahead<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
but we're something go go ahead and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
but we're something go go ahead and
click<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.730> I've<00:00:41.730> brought<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
click on it I've brought this up in the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
click on it I've brought this up in the
simulator<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.260> I've<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.500> zoomed<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.010> quite

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
simulator so I've got it zoomed up quite

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
simulator so I've got it zoomed up quite
a<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.050> we

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a bit but but as you can see that we

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
a bit but but as you can see that we
were<00:00:46.980> basically<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.460> keeping<00:00:47.789> score<00:00:47.969> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
were basically we're keeping score of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
were basically we're keeping score of
how<00:00:48.480> many<00:00:48.660> zombies<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.260> kill<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.680> are

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
how many zombies we kill which are

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
how many zombies we kill which are
basically<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> blocks<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> top<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
basically the blocks at the top that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
basically the blocks at the top that
we're<00:00:51.870> gonna<00:00:52.020> collide<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> then

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
we're gonna collide with and then

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.250 
we're gonna collide with and then
there's<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> couple<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.719> levels<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.170> are

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
there's a couple of levels that are

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
there's a couple of levels that are
involved<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.129> game<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.640> you've<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.940> we

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
involved with this game so you've got we

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
involved with this game so you've got we
started<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.629> Atlanta<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:59.070> end<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
started out with Atlanta we end up in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880 
started out with Atlanta we end up in
New<00:00:59.670> York<00:00:59.879> City<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.289> once<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> complete

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
New York City and then once we complete

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030 
New York City and then once we complete
the<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.550> zombie<00:01:03.480> hordes<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.080> waves<00:01:04.530> there

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the the zombie hordes or waves there

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
the the zombie hordes or waves there
then<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.519> complete<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> entire<00:01:06.750> game<00:01:07.200> so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
then we can complete the entire game so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.320 
then we can complete the entire game so
you<00:01:08.040> could<00:01:08.189> add<00:01:08.369> additional<00:01:08.820> levels<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you could add additional levels if you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
you could add additional levels if you
want<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.530> there's<00:01:10.770> enough<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
want but you if there's enough there to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
want but you if there's enough there to
get<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.450> since<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> idea<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
get you going since you get the idea of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
get you going since you get the idea of
what's<00:01:13.740> happening<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.729> also<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
what's happening there's also if you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.609 
what's happening there's also if you
here<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> background<00:01:16.259> there's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
here there in the background there's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.460 
here there in the background there's
also<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:17.909> audio<00:01:18.210> loop<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
also a bit of an audio loop as for the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870 
also a bit of an audio loop as for the
game<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.250> give<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.610> bit<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
game to give it a little bit of a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.780 
game to give it a little bit of a
background<00:01:21.270> sound<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.020> whenever<00:01:22.350> we

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
background sound and then whenever we

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.789 
background sound and then whenever we
take<00:01:23.790> control<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> our<00:01:24.270> paddle<00:01:24.689> ball<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
take control of our paddle ball and to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.330 
take control of our paddle ball and to
play<00:01:26.040> whenever<00:01:26.729> there's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> collision<00:01:28.340> then

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
play whenever there's a collision then

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.030 
play whenever there's a collision then
there<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.479> sound<00:01:30.930> associated<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.829> as

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
there is a sound associated with that as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370 
there is a sound associated with that as
well<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.880> shows<00:01:33.150> how<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> load<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.079> audio

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
well so it shows how to load up audio

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.120 
well so it shows how to load up audio

little<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> menuing<00:01:41.189> system<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.479> also

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
little bit of a menuing system and also

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.020 
little bit of a menuing system and also
keeps<00:01:43.020> score<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:44.189> many<00:01:44.399> zombies<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
keeps score of how many zombies that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.940 
keeps score of how many zombies that
we've<00:01:45.180> killed<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> remove<00:01:46.439> objects<00:01:46.890> from

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
we've killed how to remove objects from

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
we've killed how to remove objects from
the<00:01:47.250> screen<00:01:47.579> whenever<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> collision<00:01:48.780> occurs

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the screen whenever the collision occurs

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
the screen whenever the collision occurs
so<00:01:49.740> there's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.040> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> things<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> in

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so there's a lot of things going on in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.460 
so there's a lot of things going on in
this<00:01:51.090> tutorial<00:01:51.869> let<00:01:51.960> me<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.320> can

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
this tutorial let me see if I can

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.080 
this tutorial let me see if I can
actually<00:01:52.860> survive<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> little<00:01:53.909> hard

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
actually survive this it's a little hard

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.640 
actually survive this it's a little hard
to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> mouse<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
to do with the mouse on the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.410 
to do with the mouse on the
simulator<00:01:57.600> sometimes<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.780> lose<00:01:58.990> focus<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:01.210> I

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
simulator sometimes I lose focus if I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.020 
simulator sometimes I lose focus if I
move<00:02:01.690> too<00:02:02.020> quickly<00:02:02.470> just<00:02:03.120> like<00:02:04.120> that<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:10.000> we

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
move too quickly just like that there we

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.060 
move too quickly just like that there we
go<00:02:10.119> now<00:02:10.540> that<00:02:10.570> last<00:02:11.200> block<00:02:11.470> just<00:02:11.680> didn't<00:02:11.920> want

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
go now that last block just didn't want

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.280 
go now that last block just didn't want
to<00:02:12.100> go<00:02:12.250> all<00:02:12.490> right<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:12.850> we<00:02:13.000> we've<00:02:13.450> survived<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
to go all right so we we've survived the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.430 
to go all right so we we've survived the
zombie<00:02:15.090> hordes<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.270> we<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.720> completed<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
zombie hordes and we have completed the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.020 
zombie hordes and we have completed the
game<00:02:17.590> now<00:02:18.100> like<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.370> said<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.580> could<00:02:18.790> add

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
game now like I said you could add

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.930 
game now like I said you could add
additional<00:02:19.750> levels<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.620> want

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
additional levels to this if you want

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.250 
additional levels to this if you want
everything<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.060> included<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.630> tutorial

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
everything is included in the tutorial

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.920 
everything is included in the tutorial
and<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.070> like<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.490> said<00:02:24.640> I'm<00:02:24.730> gonna<00:02:24.850> include<00:02:25.660> a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and so I like I said I'm gonna include a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.960

description of this video so go check
that<00:02:29.800> out<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.910> happen<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.240> make<00:02:31.360> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that out and if you happen to make a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.350 
that out and if you happen to make a
mash-up<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.730> make<00:02:34.180> some

mash-up of this and you you make some

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.960 
mash-up of this and you you make some
variation<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> game<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:36.010> make<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.610> video

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
variation of the game then make a video

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.060 
variation of the game then make a video
and<00:02:37.270> send<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.930> me<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.230> would<00:02:38.440> love<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.040> a
