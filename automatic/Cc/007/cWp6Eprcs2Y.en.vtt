00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.039 

basically<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.140> draw<00:02:35.470> three<00:02:35.860> times<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:37.049> had

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
basically you you draw three times I had

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.869 
basically you you draw three times I had
