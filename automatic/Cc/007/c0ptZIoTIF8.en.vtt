What's up here Dr BC and in this episode I will show you, how to insert and eject SIM card and the memory card in Moto E.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.460

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.460
This is Moto E, recently launched by Motorola
at a price tag of 115 US $. For our previous

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.289
videos on this phone, please click on the
link flashing on yours screen. In this video,

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.910
I will show you how to insert and eject the
SIM card and the memory card in this phone.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.640
Now, to insert the SIM and SD card, you had
to take out this back, this back cover is

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.730
only, open for that. There is no notch to
remove the back cover, you can go from any

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.789
side and try to pull out the back. It is quite
tricky to remove the back cover. Try to lift

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
from all sides, and here you can see that
the back cover comes out nicely. This phone

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.789
supports the Micro SIM card. So you have to
cut down the regular SIM for Moto E.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.699
Now to insert SIM, align the SIM like that,
the notch is toward phone and contact pads

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.720
down, and then inserts the SIM into the tray.
Use your finger nail to push the SIM in. You

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.930
will hear the noise of clips. That is for
SIM 1. Similarly insert the SIM into SIM tray

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.850
two. Clips noise confirms the proper insertion.
Now I will show you how to insert the SD card

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.890
in to Moto E. Take the SD card, and make the
arrangement like that. Contact pads down,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.970
and then insert this into the phone. There
is no clip noise while inserting. Now let's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.430
see the Moto E, as you can see that the phone
ask for restarting to use SIM card, this means

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.560
that the SIM on Moto E is not hot swappable.
You have to restart Moto E each time, when

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.730
you change the SIM, very bad. Ok now my Moto
E is rebooting. This will take time. Let's

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.060
put the back cover back. And now the Moto
E is booting, nice animation. Whoa nice animations,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.060
looks like earth. Now Moto E is booted up.
Here you can see that the network is detecting,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.970
and the phone is asking for security PIN.
Now I had entered the PIN. Now you can see

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.110
that both SIM are active on Moto E.
Now I will show you the storage of the phone.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.000
Go to storage and then to the down. Here you
can see that the SD card, 1.84 GB is detected,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.700
and that much is available for use. To un-mount
tap this un-mount and the SD card is successfully

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.360
un-mounted. Now let's see that this Moto E
is compatible with 64 GB card. The maximum

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.830
storage capable is 32 GB according to Moto
E data sheet; let's see what happen when you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.950
insert a 64 GB in Moto E. Take out the back
cover, this time it is easy. Now take out

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.610
the un-mounted card and then insert this 64
GB card. As you can see that, it is hard to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.800
insert this card into SD card slot. Now it
is ok. On the Moto E you can see that the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.350
SD card is detected, but it is blank. The
mount is not working. As you can see that

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.760
it is very difficult to take out this card.
Now I will show you the 2 GB card, it is working

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.640
and detecting, but the 64 GB is not working.
The s5 is detecting this card; the card is

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.540
working well in S5. So the 64 GB card is not
working on Moto E. Is it is so, this card

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.390
works on my Galaxy star, and star pro. But
this is not working on Moto E. What is the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.490
reason for that? I had to format this card;
inside Moto G. Currently I have lot of data

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.120
inside this card, so I am not formatting this.
This card will definitely works with my Moto

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.770
E. Now I will show you how to remove the SIM,
just press the SIM and boom this will be out,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.800
now press again to put it back. In the same
manner you can take out the others, press

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.709
and the SIM will be out, then press again
the SIM will be loaded. Now you can put the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.690
SD card and then take out this, just by pulling
it out, there is not inter-lock in the SD

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.150
card slot.
So in conclusion it is very easy to insert

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.110
and eject the SIM card and the SD card in
Moto E. The dual SIM capability along with

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.010
high performance, make this best to buy at
115 $. Stay tune to us, to see how Moto E,
