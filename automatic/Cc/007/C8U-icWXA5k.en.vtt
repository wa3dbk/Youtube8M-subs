 compositional 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.100

 for that part of composition it closes a little yes to the composition that the song 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.200

 being even more vast and the lucca space there would have been really delirium 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.809
 I wonder every time I wonder why 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:40.609

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.629

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.849

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.469

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.860

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.260
