now<00:01:25.950> straight<00:01:26.340> away<00:01:26.610> i'm<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> estimate

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
now straight away i'm going to estimate

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
now straight away i'm going to estimate
this<00:01:27.570> car<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.900> cost<00:01:28.080> roughly<00:01:28.380> five<00:01:28.710> hundred

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this car will cost roughly five hundred

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.859 
this car will cost roughly five hundred
thousand<00:01:29.369> dollars<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.729> purchase<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.659> may

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
thousand dollars to purchase which may

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
thousand dollars to purchase which may
sound<00:01:31.079> expensive<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.159> anything<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
sound expensive but if anything this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700 
sound expensive but if anything this
estimation<00:01:33.479> might<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.900> slightly<00:01:34.170> too<00:01:34.409> low

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
estimation might be slightly too low

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200 
estimation might be slightly too low
especially<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.759> compare<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> other

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
especially if we compare it to other

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.749 
especially if we compare it to other
prices<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.990> other<00:01:37.380> sports<00:01:37.680> classics<00:01:38.310> for

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.530 
having a classic muscle-car style to it
I<00:02:26.159> think<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.730> car<00:02:26.939> could<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> price

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
I think this car could have a price

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
I think this car could have a price
between<00:02:27.750> sixty<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.379> seventy<00:02:28.620> thousand

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
between sixty and seventy thousand

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.250 
between sixty and seventy thousand
dollars<00:02:29.670> which<00:02:30.150> once<00:02:30.389> again<00:02:30.510> i<00:02:30.659> think<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.109> very

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
dollars which once again i think is very

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.020 
dollars which once again i think is very
reasonable<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.519> anything<00:02:32.730> this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
reasonable but if anything this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.699 
reasonable but if anything this
estimation<00:02:33.480> might<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:33.930> slightly<00:02:34.170> too<00:02:34.439> low

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
estimation might be slightly too low

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.649 
estimation might be slightly too low
especially<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:35.849> compared<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.269> cars<00:02:36.480> such

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
especially when we compared to cars such

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.959 
especially when we compared to cars such
as<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.870> vapid<00:02:37.379> blade<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:38.219> have<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> price<00:02:38.819> of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
as the vapid blade which have a price of

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.910 
as the vapid blade which have a price of
one<00:02:39.060> hundred<00:02:39.120> sixty<00:02:39.689> thousand<00:02:40.170> dollars<00:02:40.500> but

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
one hundred sixty thousand dollars but

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.530 
one hundred sixty thousand dollars but
like<00:02:41.040> i<00:02:41.189> said<00:02:41.219> in<00:02:41.549> my<00:02:41.579> opinion<00:02:41.969> i<00:02:42.239> think<00:02:42.299> this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
like i said in my opinion i think this

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.240 
like i said in my opinion i think this
car<00:02:42.750> will<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> lot<00:02:43.109> cheaper<00:02:43.139> with<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> price
