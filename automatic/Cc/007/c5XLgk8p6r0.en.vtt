00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.490
 the chinese smartphone with horner 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.780
 launched last Friday 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.460
 the Netherlands are new flagship and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.740
 like this honda 6 plus that i put in here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.269
 my hands just got in and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.800
 we go in this first impression i 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.240
 suggest you run through with one 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.529
 preliminary assessment of this telephone 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 then of course we will go for you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 and the really come with one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 final judgment on this telephone 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 let's start quickly with this one 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.949
 phone 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 love 399 euros and what a very beautiful 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.980
 price is specified in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.630
 moreover, this phone has a whole 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 unique point where we later have the most 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 preview 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 well i know him though it was the brand of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 we expensive that very affordable smartphones 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.829
 rhone brings session on the european market 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.690
 therefore also for example horne ix 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 ordinary 3c et cetera it just doesn't like it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 pray now with guests from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.930
 the via 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.489
 6 plus is slightly more expensive 3 out of 990 euros and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.570
 that can be explained in respect of the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.100
 phone is not entirely made of 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 plastic but also partly metal 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.250
 side is completely made of metal 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.039
 so its something exclusive construction 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.559
 materials using the phone 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.330
 fairly hefty in size, it is 7.5 mm 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 thin it pretty neat and but 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.540
 weighs at 170 grams that follows care 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.560
 well for that really solid 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.180
 to the touch 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 the edges are around screen and the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.799
 side will be my top and bottom 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.150
 maybe it could have been just a bit smaller 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.600
 Nonetheless phone look beautiful 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.700
 see 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.580
 is beautifully finished design is not 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 very thunderous or so yes it is 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.460
 just a very logical smartphone 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.229
 is not logical and beautiful 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 finished and yes that just has to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.829
 just well done with horner and good 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.869
 row they should have nothing to quad 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.610
 HD screen with a resolution of 25 under 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.380
 60 by 1440 pixels 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.060
 no they just choose the chinese one 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.130
 always standard for full hd display 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 similarly with the living 6 plus screen 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.079
 excess of five still inches and one 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.549
 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.619
 all in all for the pixel density of 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.049
 about 400 pp which is just really whole 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.670
 great is the screen itself 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.409
 good looking I don't think it's special 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.799
 nice screen but just a good one 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.960
 screen 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 the brightness is not very special 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.680
 look what it seems like these are 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.840
 Color rendering also looks nice 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 just good looking 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.110
 phone has not really one in terms of screen 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.970
 wow factor but the screen does look 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 just great and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.540
 it was probably nothing on down there 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.490
 to be stuff you look at the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.260
 software and does not stand out on the phone 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.140
 and north 500 ran on and on 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.520
 android free pantry KitKat that's 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.660
 a bit of a shame but maybe it will come 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 I still don't know who did it 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.860
 it is exactly a disaster again 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.690
 I do n't want to say because and kill four points 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.310
 four kitty cat is just really good and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.380
 modern operating system 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.410
 and it is also the fact that the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.230
 6 horns plus the emotion we interface 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.210
 from rough we are on phones and that 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.010
 A dua is incredibly emphatic 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.270
 is present on a telephone that is first 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.390
 stamp on an android phone and 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.950
 bustle actually looks with it's one 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.910
 world of difference with a bare version 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.580
 from android 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.990
 I still think it's a bit of a shame 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.459
 for example, I prefer all of that 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.080
 s in a separate overview 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.730
 do not immediately come to my home screen 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 but that is a personal choice guess 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.540
 I'll take that road until the phone rings 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.010
 very nice to use despite the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.990
 emotion that we get from the phone is common 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.930
 super fast is partly due to the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.380
 crack 925 processes from hour we strip 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.600
 set with 8 know four cortex a15 kennedy 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.239
 1.73 buckle locks and 4 cortex a7 kennedy 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.220
 clocked in 1.3 guide 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.660
 In addition, the phone has 3G and RAM 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.220
 That just makes sure the phone 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.260
 in a few years it will also be heavy 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.910
 wear xcom and that is just one 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.380
 very big advantage I find on it 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.570
 first sight of these 6 plus horns 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.400
 phone is easy to start using apps 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.959
 fast on heavy apps also seem first 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.150
 face to turn well 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.209
 battery is nice and big content 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.590
 of 36 100 mille per hour so would be there 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.330
 it can't go wrong either 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.160
 phone seems at first glance 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.810
 of being pleasant to use but 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.860
 of course we are also working hard on this 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.060
 the arm in our 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.980
 We are going to really review reviews there 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.540
 try to find out if this phone 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.850
 as fine as the first impression does 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.900
 suspect then we will look there 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.280
 maybe some of the nicest thing about this one 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.440
 horner 6 plus and that is the room 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.820
 back or actually has cameras 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.040
 two cameras namely and back 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.750
 are both 8 megapixel cameras and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.310
 that allows you to take a photo 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.590
 to focus afterwards then you can 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.230
 For example, determine if I now have a photo 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.489
 turns the camera I'm talking into 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.930
 can I determine afterwards if I have the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.120
 want to have cameras or the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.880
 background with light in the curtains 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.799
 I find that very nice feature that 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.769
 interface also works nice and smooth I think 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.019
 a nice 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.370
 the city culture we just good it 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.080
 seems a better one at first sight 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.129
 rooms are then those other double 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.620
 camera that wants to have it 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.750
 tested htc one m8 that room was not 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.669
 many soups with results from this camera 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.319
 like dick to be good comes too 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.710
 because he has higher resolution photos 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.050
 makes 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.639
 another nice thing is that the 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.530
 selfie camera 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.210
 it also takes 8 megapixel photos, too 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.580
 the horns 6 plus think in this 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.960
 I absolutely meet their needs because yes 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.220
 very many people who want to be happy anyway 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.080
 have a good front camera 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.729
 so they can take beautiful pictures for 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.650
 snapchat or instagram or facebook 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.050
 so yes that does horner just whole 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.300
 cheap camera in the camera area 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.250
 does the manufacturer on it is also everyone 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.990
 nothing wrong on paper and on duplicate 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.039
 camera seems to be a nice add 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.479
 nobody you can of course 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.280
 takes normal pictures but also just as well 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.860
 that k photos can still be used afterwards 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.180
 determine what you want sharp 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.229
 but then of course we go the river 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.639
 also extensive testing on that 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.440
 cameras are really as good as they do 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.050
 is suspected but we can of that 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.969
 wait to test it properly on it 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.409
 at first glance, this phone seems like everything 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:17.680
 to have good success 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.949
 to become 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.979
 unit price 400 no 400 euros 3 or 90 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.300
 euro is not that bad for that money 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.550
 get your phone with the full hd screen 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.699
 the high-end with an octa-core processor 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.139
 octa-core processor 3 4 grams 32 gigabytes 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.029
 extendable memory 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.370
 good camera to both the front and 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.169
 backside in a pretty nice design 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.819
 that is well finished 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.310
 so yes i can't wait for this one 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.139
 phone going to review first sight 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.909
 sees the phone that I 'm in 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.710
 review we are going there really final 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.150
 we try to give answers to that 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.400
 now you have to wait for a while I'm going now 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.990
 review this phone in any case 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.550
 You can get one written soon 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.229
 review and and filmed river of mine
