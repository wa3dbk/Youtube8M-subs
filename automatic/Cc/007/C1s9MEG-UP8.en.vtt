00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
chocolate bunnies I thought this would

be<00:01:02.870> fun<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:03.650> year<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.250> hide<00:01:04.549> some<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
be fun this year to hide some of the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.300 
be fun this year to hide some of the
bunnies<00:01:05.360> around<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.900> house<00:01:06.080> instead<00:01:07.010> of<00:01:07.100> just

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
bunnies around the house instead of just

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.640 
bunnies around the house instead of just
doing<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.729> ton<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.000> Easter<00:01:08.510> eggs<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.440> we<00:01:09.500> might

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
doing a ton of Easter eggs so we might

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.770 
doing a ton of Easter eggs so we might
do<00:01:09.799> a<00:01:09.830> couple<00:01:10.190> of<00:01:10.250> like<00:01:10.460> fun<00:01:10.880> Easter<00:01:11.299> eggs<00:01:11.479> or

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
do a couple of like fun Easter eggs or

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.899 
do a couple of like fun Easter eggs or
you<00:01:11.930> like<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.290> golden<00:01:12.710> one<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.010> course<00:01:13.280> but

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
you like the golden one of course but

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.399 
you like the golden one of course but
then<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.090> think<00:01:14.360> we<00:01:14.479> also<00:01:14.659> might<00:01:14.990> do<00:01:15.170> these

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
then I think we also might do these

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.340 
then I think we also might do these
bunnies<00:01:16.119> instead<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.360> many<00:01:17.510> eggs<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.229> then

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
bunnies instead of so many eggs and then

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.350 
bunnies instead of so many eggs and then
I<00:01:18.560> go<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.830> Target<00:01:19.280> for<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.520> rest<00:01:19.729> of<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.000> candy

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
I go to Target for the rest of the candy

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.850 
I go to Target for the rest of the candy
which<00:01:20.510> is<00:01:20.659> really<00:01:20.960> great<00:01:21.140> because<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.530> only

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
which is really great because I only

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.440 
which is really great because I only
have<00:01:22.190> one<00:01:22.580> child<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:24.380> helps<00:01:24.710> me<00:01:24.920> to

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
have one child and so this helps me to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.090 
have one child and so this helps me to
prevent<00:01:26.450> buying<00:01:26.689> like<00:01:26.960> bags<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.680> bags<00:01:27.830> of

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
prevent buying like bags and bags of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.219 
prevent buying like bags and bags of
candy<00:01:28.340> because<00:01:29.090> they<00:01:29.270> have<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.479> little<00:01:29.810> section

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
candy because they have a little section

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.050 
candy because they have a little section
where<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:30.680> can<00:01:30.860> get<00:01:30.979> each<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.490> these<00:01:31.580> items

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
where you can get each of these items

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.000 
where you can get each of these items
