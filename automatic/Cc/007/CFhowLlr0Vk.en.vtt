00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:15.809
 here is the beast 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:20.690
 ok you go out with a cover it's for 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.690
 that the hints you do not have us 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 the little colicis busy ramsey ch 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.550
 rather to go directly to the jemaye 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.700
 and a little low water when it does 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.760
 really too hot this is not the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.480
 best for the yield so I 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.879
 tried to show you her tits materia 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 obviously hot for the fiom who 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.149
 swirls went on after that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 it's a small flame they do nothing to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 to see much worse than that but for the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.250
 heat they emit from that one 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.180
 it's not a january I do a little 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 all kinds dessert game for now 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.580
 what works best are two the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.549
 chip briquettes simply 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:22.380
 animals shavings compressed 3 euros the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:28.530
 6 and that makes a lot of weight in front of you 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 already seen it's not bad actually I 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.840
 simply introduce the beam again 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.340
 heated 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.350
 I fill it with little peel 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 dribbles to the front and will be 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.460
 directly inspired in the home 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.380
 horizontal here 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.970
 quarter of an hour the log ice is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:00.990
 clearly the flames that are sucked 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:02.400
 down I go a little the advantage the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 is that it makes pile hair the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:12.770
 good shot compared to my home that him 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.480
 is refractory bricks in this country 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.390
 so here we had a pipe that I had 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920
 set to make desserts so I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.480
 think about doing a paddle filling 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.560
 automatic 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.780
 but since it worked well 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.290
 beam I have more or less 3h30 4h 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.990
 autonomy 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.180
 I do not think I do it then in 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.670
 the bottom a double grid to avoid 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.490
 that pollen gets tired and in 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.140
 under and an ashtray with a brick 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.020
 here which has melted but which will be passed for 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.640
 you I find it nice removable bricks 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.640
 and some leaks not pass serious 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.690
 that's the level we're asking for it's not 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.620
 complicated I did not land a hand 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.940
 on it and I 'm going to him but there are fifteen 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.390
 minutes otherwise to send it to 15 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.700
 minutes 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.760
 it starts to heat up match and everything 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.230
 was going his hand upside down if my 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.130
 notice i will soon be able to close with 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.090
 the draws are then in general account 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.840
 but wood a little obvious even though it was 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.000
 it takes a multi shot just that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.410
 decreases a little 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 the arrival of time and his opinion that it 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.000
 smoke a lid is no longer very 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.330
 strange 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.730
 here you go, do not hesitate to leave your 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.410
 comments especially ask questions 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.570
 if you ever want some 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.640
 information and I will try to 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.280
 add some photos see the videos 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.010
 first tests of the assembly 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.010
 this is berthod
