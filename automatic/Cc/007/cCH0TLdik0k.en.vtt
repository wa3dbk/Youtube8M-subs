00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.370
 a system that can prevent about one third of rear-end collisions 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.920
 or the seriousness of the 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.509
 Reduce the CEO 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 ORF with Fug and right the predicate 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.569
 while savers carry 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.109
 how such electronic distance controllers work and, above all, what they do 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.349
 You can see that now 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.409
 most road users this the risk of too low 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.369
 Safety distance to vehicles in front well aware 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.529
 but in spite of all the crises, they should be oriented towards the guiding posts 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.199
 Road markings and stopping distances There were many in everyday traffic 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.090
 unconscious too close up 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.580
 in the worst case, this leads to rear-end collisions coming from wood 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.310
 conditions 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.749
 Distance control system available in passenger cars and trucks since 1998 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.209
 usually the terms ac Cesena of the discussion forum are up to the 

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:56.890
 Ceiling or AG built 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.380
 technically, two variants of this test come to be used on his bike 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.440
 Rostock and last 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 the combination is possible and that's how it works 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.260
 the cyclist is at the desired speed and possibly also 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.040
 the distance and activated on 17 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.670
 the lane is clear and will automatically retain this speed 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.370
 as in a conventional cruise control here a front man braked 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.300
 Assistance gently and holds the default safety distance own 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.220
 until the lane is clear again an automatic acceleration on the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 previously set desire speed 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.840
 what the CVP usually in the speed range of 30 to 200 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.220
 Kilometers per hour 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.780
 there are also systems that work white band Groovin upsetting 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.479
 the passenger is currently relieving frequent drivers on highways but ch 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.640
 also for safety and environmental protection 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.630
 On motorways, about one third of rear-end collisions could be avoided 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.190
 And that's around fifty thousand a year 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.870
 It also helps reduce fuel consumption by about ten percent 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.280
 Conclusion of the electronic passenger as CC is comfortable and safe he is gentle 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.400
 Purse and environment and actually belongs in Triglitz vehicle
