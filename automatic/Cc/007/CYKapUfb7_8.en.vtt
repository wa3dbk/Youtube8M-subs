 in not too rich on interesting 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.530
 game plots 2012 one of the few 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.840
 projects managed to offer 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.449
 fascinating story turned out to be game of 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.640
 thrones rpg many characters each 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.050
 with his skeleton in the closet courtiers 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.449
 intrigue and proprietary dark atmosphere 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.140
 fans of the ice song 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.419
 and flame 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.429
 however first of all it was not merit 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.350
 cyanide developers studio from 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.570
 george martin created wonderful 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.790
 the universe and overseen spelling 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.920
 the script for the game is now the same cyanide 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.900
 had the opportunity to prove that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.040
 without foreign source material they are not 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.500
 hit the face 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.930
 together with the studio spider they own 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.880
 allure olive parks and men action 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.250
 which happens in invented by them 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.450
 world but what came of it now 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.910
 let's try to figure it out 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.470
 pleasantly surprised when meeting a game 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.290
 first of all non-standard approach 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.690
 authors classic fantasy stamp 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.759
 the orcs they created the universe are not 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.920
 brainless critters brazenly on 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.869
 rights and freedoms 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640
 the continent and the series exactly the representatives 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.220
 human race want to enslave 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.000
 proud tribes of greenskins living in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.130
 southern lands 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 in a multi-year standoff is nearing 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.960
 turning point homes emperor of the people 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.560
 is going to make an alliance with elves and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.330
 the gnomes 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.550
 Of course this promises nothing to orcs. 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.440
 good so one of the elite warriors 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.890
 squad bloodsuckers named arch silt 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.970
 is assigned to kill a monarch 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.610
 his journey becomes guide 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.830
 stix is ​​one of a kind sensible 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.470
 goblin sadly the most vivid impression 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.600
 from the game leaves exactly promising 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.729
 the beginning after which rapidly 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.650
 disappointment comes first 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.720
 frustrating weak local work 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.460
 the universe here will not deceive you 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.380
 kilobytes of text telling 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.720
 numerous religions traditions 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.580
 stories do joke about world presence 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 elves and gnomes generally resemble only in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.880
 beginning and closer to the final showing us on 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.220
 a couple of minutes of their ambassadors 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.409
 the writers and the character rested 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.659
 abarka or everything says it is incredible 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.760
 the original nickname butcher before us 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.950
 the most common Mordovorot tormented 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.870
 dark memories of his struggle with 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.040
 does not touch with internal anger and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.659
 weakly reflected in the plot as a whole 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.730
 immediately striking the gulf between 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.090
 orcs morsom best for dummies game of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.489
 thrones 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.170
 one in general, but as far as 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.209
 this is a huge difference in implementation 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 Morse character really revealed 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.959
 in intimate conversations near the fire where he 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.189
 talked about his past and family 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.829
 which had to quit 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.450
 having gone to war his mental throwing between 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.970
 guilt and war duty 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.489
 forced sincerely empathized forks 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.680
 sandman does not cause emotion and partner 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.379
 arch ella situation does not save the goblin 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.450
 stiks and so donkey from shrek 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.109
 refusing too funny jokes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 at first he tries to look like 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.030
 finished price tag but in the end of course 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.620
 it turns out to be a cool pair 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.540
 cook a convenient plot mess with so 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.879
 dull heroes would be difficult at 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.950
 developers and the script failed 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.419
 replete with banal twists and finals 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.269
 History language does not turn to call 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.139
 reward for the effort before the ending works 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.239
 and band 1 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.639
 and for more than ten hours 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.590
 the player is fed only the illusion of choice and 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.629
 familiar from the game of thrones dialogue with 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.939
 style answers yes and come on 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.400
 still saddens that the author abruptly 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.829
 reduced the number of plot clips and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.840
 general chatter generously diluted it all 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.150
 the gameplay with which they have absolutely trouble 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.190
 now we are regularly forced to fight 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.959
 break through the corridors by degree 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.609
 linearity able to compete with 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.709
 levels and chipping blowing towards 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.479
 side quests better not even watch 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.250
 one has only to agree to the execution 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.810
 additional orders like you 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.970
 will be sent to the next gut shaped 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.859
 location without the ability to go back 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.169
 and the maximum that in this case can be 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.540
 hoping for some pants is ridiculous 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.699
 a scant handful of loot and all would be fine if 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.959
 it would be interesting to fight 2 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.819
 playable characters with their 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.680
 skill sets and tactical pause 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.099
 seem to be fascinating 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.079
 battle 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.729
 but no beating the blunt 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.470
 artificial intelligence tires a 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.870
 most of the fights can be completed 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.150
 never regaining consciousness and taking advantage 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.829
 one or two tactics better to save 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.540
 time and choosing a stick to turn on 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.090
 invisibility to reduce the population 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.729
 enemies covertly stealth in the brainchild of cyanide and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.409
 spider stand-up comedy 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.810
 here you can only if you go to 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.150
 a foe really close or slaughter 1 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.159
 dummy in front of another while 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.320
 but the cooling corpses of comrades are no one 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:24.320
 apparently not the usual case 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.260
 confess forces and men only approved 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.120
 we are in the opinion that the last attempt 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.770
 authors game of thrones rpg and create 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.600
 convincing story succeeded 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.000
 exclusively thanks to first-class 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.480
 source material and support george 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.940
 martin 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.010
 this time they took a step back and judging 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.930
 around again returned to production 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.690
 nondescript crafts yes in the new creation 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.550
 cyanide spider and decent graphics good 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.350
 in some places design and technically 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.150
 all decent no bugs and 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.220
 wanton brakes have been reported 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.230
 the game is not disgusting 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.280
 but the pleasure of it is a little alas 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.280
 typical passing 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:24.750
