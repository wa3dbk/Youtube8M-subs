did this right here just wrote Galaxy
Nexus<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:31.080> most<00:00:31.289> likely<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
Nexus and I think and it's most likely a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.900 
Nexus and I think and it's most likely a
truth<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.130> lot<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.340> people<00:00:32.430> didn't<00:00:32.759> even

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
truth that a lot of people didn't even

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.150 
truth that a lot of people didn't even
bother<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> watch<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.719> video<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
bother to watch the video so so when I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.470 
bother to watch the video so so when I
just<00:00:35.460> decided<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.059> include<00:00:36.210> those

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
just decided not to include those

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
just decided not to include those
entries<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
entries so as you can see this is a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
entries so as you can see this is a
correct<00:00:38.820> entry<00:00:39.149> galaxy<00:00:39.510> s3<00:00:39.809> because<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.050> has

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
correct entry galaxy s3 because it has

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.069 
correct entry galaxy s3 because it has
s3<00:00:40.649> keyword<00:00:41.129> 1x<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> fine<00:00:42.239> nexus<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> fine

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
s3 keyword 1x is fine nexus one is fine

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
s3 keyword 1x is fine nexus one is fine
so<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.860> watch<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> video<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.879> probably

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so if you watch the video you probably

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
so if you watch the video you probably
know<00:00:45.480> how<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.530> annoy<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.920> that
