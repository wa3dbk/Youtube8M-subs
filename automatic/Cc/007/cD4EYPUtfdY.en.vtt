00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 I liked this hairstyle so that it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 very quickly very easily done when 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 it is that it looks spectacular 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 hairstyle every time will be a new way 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 Look with various accessories from 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 so today we will try to do 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 something like 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 for riding this gloves we need 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 second comb elastic band 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 the color of your hair 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 further we will need studs desirable 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 and more convenient if they are 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 I have one of various sizes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.120
 such in length and others less to us 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.430
 will need 125 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.829
 on slightly towel-dried hair 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.170
 put a small amount of lung 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.210
 conditioner balsam for volume and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.190
 hair elasticity pre 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.190

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.830

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.430
 minute and untangle the hair after which 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.620
 washing off then I washed the mask dried 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.990
 hair and turn to the very hairstyle 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 for starters, I expose on curling 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.500
 temperature of 180 degrees as I think 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.370
 her most optimal for creating 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.980
 curls and hair straighteners 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:48.850
 and at this time I will comb the set and 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.290
 I will highlight the side parting hair I will 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.760
 fill not all that is why I highlight 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.130
 strands of two sides somewhere year ear and with 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.410
 other doing the same thing all 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 I collect the rest of the hair with 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.790
 Crabic so that they do not bother me 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.890
 and now I need a special one 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.240
 liquid for laying which without effort 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.940
 help me create 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.490
 elastic curls while it does not stick together 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.350
 hair and well removed when 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.840
 combing I'm spraying 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.910
 straining a little dry before 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.040
 how will I fill 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.780
 wash curls warmed up so i 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:38.440
 turn to the creation of curls 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:44.080
 I will curl them starting from the bottom and 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.830
 going up I hold for a few seconds 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.830
 and let go 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:09.550
 take off the crab and distribute the curls 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:13.030
 fingers now take elastic 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.620
 gum and hairpins for fixing hair and 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.190
 at the very ends we fix with 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.190
 elastic bands 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.080
 bundle I will wrap with both hands 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.080
 in roller 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.160
 and fix the result with studs 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.030
 it remains only to correct strands in front 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.310
 if you have some kind of me then 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.170
 Not all hair will be in a hairstyle and 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.680
 for example, this is 5 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.520
 I want her to somehow not fall off 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.080

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.080
