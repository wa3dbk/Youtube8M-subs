00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.550
 Developed by the creators of the last Mortal Kombat, Injustice is a brawler of the mold 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.980
 classic in which the most famous heroes of the DC universe are to give themselves to it 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.980
 Comics. 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.750
 The recall of the license and the mechanics very similar to those of the previous work will suffice 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.440
 of the team to convince the players? 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.190
 It seems superfluous to talk about the plot in a fighting game's review, but the development team 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.870
 wanted to give a lot of emphasis to the game modes for "solitary" users. 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 The Story mode is set in an alternative universe in which Superman has established a 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.010
 sort of dictatorship, after a tragic event that destroyed Metropolis and the wife of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 good Clark Kent. 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.890
 The plot proceeds with that somewhat imaginative doing typical of many cross-over comics, 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.550
 avoiding too many inconsistencies and succeeding in piling the story into a progression 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.010
 all in all sensible, and progress is enlivened by some unpublished Quick Time Event. 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.530
 All in all the structure stands up, also thanks to the charisma of the protagonists: the team 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.230
 has been able to take advantage of the license well, satisfying those looking for a more framed experience. 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.680
 The presence of the "Stars Laboratories" missions responds to the same need: beyond 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 260 extra missions, sometimes very special, in which to work to obtain the classic ones 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 three stars. 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.270
 The player's level, which allows you to unlock alternate costumes and other items, 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.190
 it is a further incentive to spend many hours in the company of Injustice. 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.190
 It is a pity that then, having come to explore the multiplayer sector, we come across 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 a bleak poverty of options. 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.212
 Only the local and online confrontation: really the bare minimum for a fighting game. 

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:43.210
 As soon as you take the pad in hand, Injustice reveals the many correlations with the previous one 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 work of the development team: the feeling, the physics of jumps and blows, the reactions 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.110
 the punches are exactly those of the last &lt;b&gt; Mortal Kombat &lt;/B&gt;. 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.320
 And just like the title dedicated to Raiden and Johnny Cage, at first the game appears a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.910
 slightly woody, only to be perfectly functional for the execution of combinations 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.600
 however quite varied, with a clear focus on Juggling's dynamics. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.400
 However, Injustice does not show great depth. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.670
 The fairly skimpy move list allows you to run a number that is certainly not exuberant 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.750
 of combinations, and it is the special attacks that make it a little more lively 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 situation. 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.300
 Each hero has his prerogatives, all to be discovered: some merely enhance 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.030
 the basic attacks, leaving a little dumbfounded in terms of variety. 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.140
 Others instead materialize weapons or special gadgets. 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 The good variety and respect for the classic iconography of the characters brought into play succeeds 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.160
 all in all to refresh the fighting. 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.560
 Then we find the dynamics related to the special bar. 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 Thanks to this it is possible to enhance one of the distinctive moves, adding a second one 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.620
 hit after the first one scored, or repel the opponent after a parade. 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.640
 Both of these options actually seem quite superfluous, and it's much better, 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.290
 in the economy of the clash, wait until you have accumulated all the bar to perform 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.080
 a devastating final move, capable of affecting a significant portion of the life bar. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:10.900
 The bar can also be used for a special counter, which activates a short one 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.560
 cut-scene in which the two fighters will launch themselves against each other. 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.040
 Despite the overall variety is good, also increased by the dynamics of interaction 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 with the gaming environment, many of Injustice's solutions do not seem well balanced, 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.840
 and certainly don't make the games more technical. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.849
 Perfect for a few games between friends, Injustice is in short a title certainly substantial, 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.310
 but maybe a little too light in the long run. 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:47.879
 The work of the development team is solid with regards to the technical and artistic sector. 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.460
 The good polygonal mass is exhibited in models that emphasize an almost Gothic reinterpretation 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.390
 of the protagonists of the DC universe. 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.440
 The animations are quite jerky, but the choice seems intentional to replicate the rhythms 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.640
 and the "theatricality" of the aforementioned Mortal Kombat that the public enjoyed so much. 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.240
 The glance is rather pleasant, especially as regards the &lt;b&gt; modeling 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.550
 of the arenas &lt;/B&gt;, real protagonists of Gods Among Us. 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.019
 A little aliasing and a "plasticky" effect of certain elements do not distract attention 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.599
 from a solid framerate and a convincing texturization. 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.599
 Good dubbing (unlike that of the previous job), a little less savory 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.440
 the accompanying music: few tracks from the soundtrack, and certainly not very inspired. 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.550
 Injustice can be considered as a "popular" fighting game, which strives 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.790
 above all to please the general public and to propose an overall experience well 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.139
 structured, rather than refining and balancing the dynamics of the combat system. 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.099
 Mastering the twenty-four heroes of the DC Comics universe does not require great technicalities, 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.849
 rather a bit of memory and a generic predisposition for the Juggling. 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.900
 It is obviously possible to study tactics and combos with more attention, but urgency 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.370
 the main title seems to follow a bombastic spectacularity, conveyed thanks 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.939
 to the duels, to the transitions between the sectors of the maps, to the abundance of interactive elements.
