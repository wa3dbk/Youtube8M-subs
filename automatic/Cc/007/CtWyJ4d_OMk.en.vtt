00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.870
 magazine fashion knitting for the whole family 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.340
 and in this video tutorial we will tell you how 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 perform a long loop which is otherwise 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.190
 also called an elongated loop or 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.350
 boucle loop 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 so to make a long 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.449
 loop we need to perform 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029
 pre chain of aerial 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 loops and knit and at least one or two 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 a number of columns without nakida here we already 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.149
 sample is ready and show you how it looks 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.180
 Now we start a row, enter the hook 1 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.000
 crochet the bottom loop 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.149
 crochet clockwise thread which 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.210
 on above the index finger hold 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 hook under the index finger and 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.750
 crochet and who are 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 under the pointer fall down to the common bracket 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.699
 crossing and we pull the hook out 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.859
 Our base loops on hook us 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.460
 it turned out two loops we seize the worker 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.150
 the thread that we have is under 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.770
 from under the index finger and draw out 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 of our two loops pav we continue 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.780
 enter the hook into the next loop 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.840
 the grounds are hooked 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.770
 working over your index finger over 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.610
 clockwise 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 pull the hook under 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 pointer to the finger and grab the thread 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.960
 under the index finger pull 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.409
 loop on the hook two loops capture 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.750
 thread and pull through two loops at once 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.130
 here we are all ready for two 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.000
 loops stretched booklet continue 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 next loop 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.049
 the base we enter the hook grab 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.899
 we pull the upper working thread under 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.590
 lower working thread and pull as if 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.729
 crossed over or again razdnichka 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.680
 stretch 2 loops all 3 loop elongated 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.130
 ready so continue with you until the end 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.299
 row we enter the hook 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.580
 from above capture and from below capture 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.520
 we stretch 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.330
 and again no job grabbing it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.180
 through two loops 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.190
 we introduce the next loop to capture 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.800
 top bottom 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.150
 we stretch with certain skills all 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.700
 it turns out very were the scene here we are with 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.370
 you tied the series to the end like this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.430
 It looks on the one hand and a typhoon 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.400
 view from the other side 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.320
 further further in order to knit 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400
 elongated loops loops loops next 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.220
 we will need to knit again 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.710
 nakida column and so we will do 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.140
 so let's alternate one row knit 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.590
 next single rows 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.000
 knit elongated boucle loops or else 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.580
 called long peaks here loops u 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.490
 we are resilient 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:57.200
 do not draw well how to say no no 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.680
 drawn to the wrong side on 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.380
 the downside of knitting here is very 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:09.370
 It turns out very similar to 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 knitted all good bye
