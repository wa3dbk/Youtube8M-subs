00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 gross shop puntonet is pleased to invite you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.589
 in a new video review today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.620
 we're going to see the terminal x12 cube 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.080
 entry level terminal that really does the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.509
 its value for money one of the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 strengths of this phone then 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.449
 let's not get lost in small talk 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.449
 start the video immediately 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.170
 let's go straight to analyzing the part 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.020
 aesthetics of the device when 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.570
 let's take kubot x12 for the first time 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.520
 in hand after unpacking it you can 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.650
 immediately understand how the company has 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.379
 worked well on this terminal 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.510
 the materials are excellent the back part 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.580
 of the device is a rough part 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.620
 therefore a very good grip 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.930
 inside this smartphone and all 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.699
 the hardware features of the are 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.890
 really high level we will have the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.690
 possibility of going to remove the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.469
 our battery having a back cover 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.050
 removable and 2200 milan battery 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.520
 for we will have free access to the two sims e 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.140
 also the possibility of going to 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.450
 insert a micro sd 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.570
 the weight is relatively low yes 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.850
 talk about 150 grams for this kubot x12 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.320
 and the thickness of only 8.55 mm la 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.160
 hardware part of the device is 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.000
 characterized by a gpu mediatek mtk 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.630
 67 35 m quad core 64 bit display 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.160
 5 inch lcd one gigabyte of ram 8 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.490
 gigabytes of internal memory we have 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.209
 called expandable android in version 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.830
 5.1 lollipop 4g lte wifi gps bluetooth 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:46.220
 a rear 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.280
 5 megapixel front a battery from 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.830
 2200 milan for one of the strengths of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.509
 this kubot x12 in my opinion the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 software customization 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.090
 or we have android lollipop in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.860
 version 5.1 but is a proper lollipop 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 stocks like we also have for example 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.630
 within nex 5 therefore also who is 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.330
 lover of this interface of the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 material design will look great on 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.210
 this type of device 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.210
 let's now analyze the audio test 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.530
 before leaving with our classics 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.920
 benchmark test quadrant en tutorial 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.080
 racing and big bank 3 we go to see the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.790
 temperature of our device first 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.790
 precisely to perform the re-head 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.030
 Yup 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.250
 after almost ten minutes on the right the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.860
 temperature reaches around 40 degrees 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.690
 but the heat dissipation on this 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.940
 smartphone is really good 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.900
 in fact they are not perceived in the least 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.820
 these high line temperatures 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.340
 maximum a device that we can't 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.010
 which advise you given the price 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.370
 relatively content and the version of 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.800
 android that arrives at lollipop 5.1 in 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.480
 stock version a device that 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.860
 could be your device 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.810
 favorite 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.400

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.670
