00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
cutting around the ears here but I think

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.920 
cutting around the ears here but I think
it's<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.160> little<00:04:23.520> cute<00:04:23.789> little<00:04:23.930> sophisticated

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.170 
look
I<00:04:25.900> think<00:04:26.229> is<00:04:26.350> Huell<00:04:26.910> especially<00:04:27.910> for<00:04:28.090> the

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
I think is Huell especially for the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.620 
I think is Huell especially for the
spring<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.110> summer<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:30.669> I<00:04:31.000> think<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.330> will<00:04:31.510> go

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
spring and summer and I think I will go

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.570 
spring and summer and I think I will go
ahead<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:31.930> put<00:04:32.139> some<00:04:32.169> concealer<00:04:32.620> on<00:04:32.800> top<00:04:33.250> just

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
ahead and put some concealer on top just

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.640 
ahead and put some concealer on top just
so<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.940> can<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.150> even<00:04:34.419> more<00:04:34.449> defined<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.440> might

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
so it can be even more defined I might

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.010 
so it can be even more defined I might
even<00:04:35.800> go<00:04:36.010> ahead<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.310> tweeze<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.930> since<00:04:37.930> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
even go ahead and tweeze this since the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.990 
even go ahead and tweeze this since the
hair<00:04:38.199> is<00:04:38.440> really<00:04:38.800> fake<00:04:40.830> I'm<00:04:41.830> pretty<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.760> I
