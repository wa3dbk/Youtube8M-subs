 Hey, it's Felipe voigt so you can come to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 war in that series of videos that I 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.740
 I know you love it, you know I did it. 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.539
 with gta 4 and it's obvious focus of gt subject 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 also deserves its own videos of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 can be the wife interesting after all 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 gta feel one of the biggest and most 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 detailed quality games and has 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.490
 fucking video price content 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 simply and without further ado 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.899
 there the first blog of it comes down to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.090
 go through walls you love to see this 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.820
 no matter what the occasion behind the wall is 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.000
 simple cool as fuck though yes 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.129
 matter the occasion if bathe occurs in 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.780
 parallel the kiss only in the police stations 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.700
 and can be arrested to find out where the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.340
 joke station marked on the map and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.539
 wall to the right of the entrance door 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.059
 simply do not have applied physics to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 circular you just fall and have seen 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.420
 that kind of loop system of the whole 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.460
 game in which you cross the map goes 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 fall for a half mile on the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.199
 point exactly on the surface of the map. 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.510
 and with pop physics this game already seen right? 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.490
 fall never lose grace you can stay 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.100
 jumping as many times as you want because it 's 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.479
 It's cool, dude, that a law is legal. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 the next is a detail that left me 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.409
 puzzled I do not know if it's an easter egg 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.000
 a reference to something with a movie 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.799
 a series that I did not get a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.259
 simply a texture bench of the game 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.700
 the bangu of the producers even in this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.430
 point here on the map or if you are walking 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 you can repair something peculiar 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.729
 especially if you have the evening is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.439
 a golden tree 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.869
 ranking is the kind of thing that wins 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.000
 your face attention that the pine of 40 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.680
 meters of correct gold there 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.079
 there is no doubt what the fuck is that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970
 Fuck you have a shiny tree. 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.310
 which stands out in the middle of several other 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.530
 It's enough to comment on the people. 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 It's cool then it marks as a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.700
 interest and let's next next 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 reference on board in addition to the two is 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 purchased kind of workshop that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.369
 is also here in bauru bale is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 marked on the map you came here from the side 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.500
 out if you will notice a kind of a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.159
 trash a box the generator I had not 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.530
 idea 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.899
 fuck that is what is evident is the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
 painting that object from that box 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.489
 strange identical to the robot painting 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.000
 clapton is our darling and manu with ozil 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.010
 wise 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 I think I'm the only person in the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:25.800
 world that likes cleto is serious gomaq 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:28.709
 robozinho at last is as follows 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.840
 we know gta5 a fucking game that gave birth to 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.730
 Mind detailed face can play it there 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.830
 for the entire Bible and will always have a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.540
 detail something you did not know 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.070
 had not discovered before is a detail 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.640
 I find it as cool as it gets. 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.020
 simply a hashi my friend after 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.209
 disinforms in the face if signalers 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.090
 Do you have a car with the days? 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.770
 except nothing a decent car to race 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.959
 you stop next to another car that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.120
 also be the deficit for the non-running 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.510
 will crack signal with a bus a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.040
 taxi driver or an old woman in the sub-11 of a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.780
 Time is not silver 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.820
 I never saw it once, but at last 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.770
 to brake the brake start to accelerate 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.209
 whether it's singing a tire or just speeding up 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.340
 car then blink the headlight any 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.590
 type sign and the guy will understand how 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.030
 a whole says an invitation for a hashi it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.530
 will give a signal usually speak some 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.150
 because it gives a sign that he accepted in the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.519
 same red light it will trigger a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.620
 retarded 75 time running behind him is 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.870
 equal or delayed the race has no end 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.700
 and beginning itself that only goes 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.500
 to start running for weight, you can take a 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.330
 take the test runs faster but 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.920
 usually not due to the beautiful 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.660
 drivers in this game he will beat the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.850
 car that happens to fuck there yes to 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.500
 ask what you win fucking win 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.209
 none is that kind of streak that we 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.280
 sees everywhere next faces run a 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.049
 risk of breaking in half and an accident 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.090
 that involves a family in a 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.799
 bus stop for fuck 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.420
 besides feeding a little your 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.310
 alter-ego face another detail that I 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.560
 I find it very interesting from this 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.180
 My life changed in gt day is the following 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.010
 we know you have the gun in a 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.829
 car and push the button to shoot it 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.630
 serious shoot is true but has already proven 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.020
 think what it does if you have 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.730
 selected stamp it shows finger 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.740
 it was just the old man who brilliantly and simply 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.600
 The party says I discovered this I think 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.760
 I never walked stay showing the finger 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.530
 For everyone on the street, you already thought of 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.690
 find one of the characters with another 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.850
 character game, that's why I ended up doing 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.920
 without wanting to find iron 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.380
 using franklin and finally we know that 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.660
 Fred is the most unpredictable guy ever 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.940
 won the game world or not 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.650
 I found him in the woods in the fifth 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.840
 the fuck was singing friend trying to find 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.430
 Default zinha optional and then I changed 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.170
 character and when I came across 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.330
 trevor he simply greeted 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.650
 beauty and father father I simply started 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.380
 to follow the work to see what he 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.030
 it was where I hear him his reaction 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.860
 in time he started to get pissed 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.900
 Yes, they meant what he was going to do. 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.760
 wanted witnesses and keep the car out 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.710
 and I continued sign he warned more 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.210
 since it threatened to give a beating and 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.160
 then listen to me as I continue 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.890
 following him and guess what he got more 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.840
 Rudolph took a punch in the face. 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.580
 said that I died expensive guy have from 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.770
 From this gil I learned to keep a certain 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.350
 safe distance of iron and coal 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.730
 Let everyone do what is 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.470
 Thank you so much for watching. 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.540
 As I already said, yes, there's going to be a 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.580
 video of itself maybe next one after 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.860
 next face has crappy content 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.090
 crowding people here but finally enough 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.130
 connected to the channel that was not 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.450
 write and if you like, you already know 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.580
 what to do and thank you so much 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.580
 watching, thanks, and until the next
