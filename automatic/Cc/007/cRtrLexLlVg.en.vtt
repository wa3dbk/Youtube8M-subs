00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.360
 [music] 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.270
 hello guys my name is paderin 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 today you will learn how to do this 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.189
 item like butterfly or 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.010
 in order to learn it at least 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.010
 you should be good at the wheel 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.940
 if you are a master of sports on the wheel then you 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.710
 everything will turn out without problems and so in 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.110
 starting position getting up whom 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.030
 right leg push and on the wheel that she 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.680
 there will be jolts on butterflies if left then 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.460
 accordingly, butterflies will also be needed 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.000
 him get up to the starting position and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.909
 do this movement and start it 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.680
 movement is done in order to raise 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.979
 you up that is not only to you 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.220
 kicked yourself and throw off once again 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.890
 would bounce 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.530
 with your back with your leg out 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.600
 jolts shorter everything is clear here 5 when 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.550
 this you must still strongly waved his hand 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.370
 no way back to the web site to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.650
 so that the body goes below you 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.490
 lean pits goes exactly and already from 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.490
 of this position 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:34.310
 that is, the poppy and this movement is 1 time 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.190
 when you master it you can already 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.710
 proceed to the execution of the element itself 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.240
 many fear that they will fall for bare 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.340
 or account as a general with this element 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.650
 need to fall don't understand the code just need 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.460
 rise from one foot to the other and all when 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.080
 in this move your back and foot 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.820
 it is necessary to start the wrong way not to jump 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.240
 no need for golf and dancing 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.020
 walking and doing like this this is not necessary 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.380
 you just have to do it where 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.360
 that is, 180 degrees 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.340
 and lift it up while doing 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.099
 powerful swing foot all to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.770
 unfolded the body the element will go to the desired 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:20.570
 plane as soon as you took off 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.960
 lift the other leg up 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.990
 Tamah your land on the fly 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.990
 a leg 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.400
 The main mistakes in this element are 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.459
 many since I already said waving my foot 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.519
 forward and not up I showed and they 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.360
 forget to lift the body from below that is 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.819
 when you leave 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.909
 leave 0 body here and thereby 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.269
 it turns out us a real and this is absolutely 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.829
 no one 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.140
 that is, do not forget necessarily 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.890
 lift the body up with you with 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.890
 forget it 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.049
 staff 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.569
