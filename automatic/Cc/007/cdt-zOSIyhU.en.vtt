have<00:00:13.530> been<00:00:13.740> supporting<00:00:14.190> each<00:00:14.280> other<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:15.150> I

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
have been supporting each other what I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.670 
have been supporting each other what I
love<00:00:15.599> about<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.929> council<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.619> think

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
love about this council is that I think

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.840 
love about this council is that I think
it's<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.250> time<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.670> trends

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it's the first time that these trends

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.890 
it's the first time that these trends
are<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.359> be<00:00:18.420> brought<00:00:18.720> together

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
are going to really be brought together

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140 
are going to really be brought together
this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.710> where<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> promise<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.000> can

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
this is where the promise of what we can

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
this is where the promise of what we can
do<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.539> bigger<00:00:21.779> than<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.320> job

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this time Sony came around to us and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.330 
this time Sony came around to us and
they<00:00:31.289> came<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> our<00:00:31.560> office<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.130> said

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
they came to our office and they said

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.500 
they came to our office and they said
here's<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.610> we're<00:00:32.820> thinking<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
here's what we're thinking what are you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
here's what we're thinking what are you
guys<00:00:33.720> thinking<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> been<00:00:34.829> held

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
guys thinking what have you been held

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
guys thinking what have you been held
back<00:00:35.220> by<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.720> do<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
back by and what would you do if you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.750 
back by and what would you do if you
didn't<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.739> technical<00:00:38.010> limitations

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
didn't have any technical limitations

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
didn't have any technical limitations
that<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.270> gave<00:00:39.570> us<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> possibility<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that they gave us the possibility to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.650 
that they gave us the possibility to
provide<00:00:40.739> feedback<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.850> adapt<00:00:42.180> based<00:00:42.449> on

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
provide feedback and to adapt based on

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
provide feedback and to adapt based on
the<00:00:42.750> feedback<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.199> received<00:00:43.530> from

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the feedback they received from

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.200 
the feedback they received from
developers<00:00:44.160> vera<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.820> me<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.970> very

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
developers vera was for me a very

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.210 
developers vera was for me a very
important<00:00:45.600> message<00:00:45.720> all<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.650> developers

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
important message all these developers

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.090 
important message all these developers
had<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> hand<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:49.080> helping<00:00:49.470> form<00:00:49.830> what

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
had a hand in actually helping form what

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.950 
had a hand in actually helping form what
the<00:00:50.280> PlayStation<00:00:50.850> 4<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.330> eventually<00:00:51.600> turn

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the PlayStation 4 would eventually turn

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.079 
the PlayStation 4 would eventually turn
out<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.290> be<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.980> took<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:53.550> into

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
out to be we took all that into

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.979 
out to be we took all that into
consideration<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.949> create<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.210> system<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
consideration to create the system that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.400 
consideration to create the system that
just<00:00:58.589> works<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.909> we<00:01:00.089> think<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.260> word

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
just works when we think about the word

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.830 
just works when we think about the word
simple<00:01:01.829> we've<00:01:02.550> chosen<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.210> interpret<00:01:03.360> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
simple we've chosen to interpret that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.070 
simple we've chosen to interpret that
with<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> comparable<00:01:05.009> word<00:01:05.390> elegance<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.630> to

with a comparable word elegance and to

with a comparable word elegance and to
us<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.500> means<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.580> balance<00:01:09.210> between<00:01:09.420> how

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.449 
personalization there can be a
relationship<00:01:45.360> between<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.739> of<00:01:46.890> content

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
relationship between the kind of content

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.729 
relationship between the kind of content
that<00:01:47.550> I'm<00:01:47.670> interested<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.750> how<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
that I'm interested in and how the

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:51.889 
that I'm interested in and how the
options<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.399> presented<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.880> me<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.690> this

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
options are presented to me so this

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.410 
options are presented to me so this
system<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:53.099> very<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.759> aware<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
system actually is very much aware of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.479 
system actually is very much aware of
the<00:01:54.810> player<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.319> what's<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.190> on<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
the player and what's going on in the

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:58.880 
the player and what's going on in the
room<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.819> any<00:01:56.940> given<00:01:57.239> point<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.440> example

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
room at any given point so for example

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
room at any given point so for example
when<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.429> a<00:01:59.520> PlayStation<00:01:59.940> Store<00:02:00.200> right

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
when I go to a PlayStation Store right

everyone's time
it<00:02:19.410> doesn't<00:02:19.739> involve<00:02:19.950> three<00:02:20.790> minutes<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> boot

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it doesn't involve three minutes of boot

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390 
it doesn't involve three minutes of boot
up<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.840> disk<00:02:22.170> shuffling<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.950> sort<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.129> all<00:02:23.280> of

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
these things that are just like a

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.690 
these things that are just like a
nuisance<00:02:25.170> between<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.830> impulse<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> play<00:02:26.670> a
