now<00:00:02.960> in<00:00:03.110> this<00:00:03.230> video<00:00:03.759> another<00:00:04.759> one<00:00:04.940> on<00:00:05.089> the

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
now in this video another one on the

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.929 
now in this video another one on the
road<00:00:05.509> to<00:00:05.839> proving<00:00:06.319> Pythagoras<00:00:07.009> I'm<00:00:07.519> going<00:00:07.819> to

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:07.939 
road to proving Pythagoras I'm going to

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.600 
road to proving Pythagoras I'm going to
prove<00:00:08.269> that<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:09.410> angles<00:00:09.890> of<00:00:10.070> a<00:00:10.310> triangle

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
prove that the angles of a triangle

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.590 
prove that the angles of a triangle
always<00:00:11.210> add<00:00:11.390> up<00:00:11.570> to<00:00:11.840> 180<00:00:12.620> degrees<00:00:13.330> so<00:00:14.330> looking

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
always add up to 180 degrees so looking

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.650 
always add up to 180 degrees so looking
at<00:00:14.690> a<00:00:14.720> triangle<00:00:15.290> like<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:15.470> one<00:00:15.890> here<00:00:16.600> how<00:00:17.600> do

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
at a triangle like this one here how do

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.440 
at a triangle like this one here how do
you<00:00:17.900> prove<00:00:18.110> that<00:00:18.170> well<00:00:18.860> let's<00:00:19.730> take<00:00:20.270> this

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
you prove that well let's take this

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.320 
you prove that well let's take this
triangle<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:21.170> start<00:00:21.500> copying<00:00:21.920> it<00:00:22.100> it<00:00:22.910> take<00:00:23.210> it

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
triangle and start copying it it take it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.920 
triangle and start copying it it take it
once<00:00:23.650> compute<00:00:24.650> put<00:00:25.010> it<00:00:25.160> there<00:00:25.600> copy<00:00:26.600> it<00:00:26.750> again

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
once compute put it there copy it again

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.510 
once compute put it there copy it again
put<00:00:27.110> it<00:00:27.260> there<00:00:27.610> that's<00:00:28.610> something<00:00:28.940> like<00:00:28.970> this

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
put it there that's something like this

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.240 
put it there that's something like this
now<00:00:31.520> as<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.699> can<00:00:31.910> see<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.660> triangles<00:00:33.260> can<00:00:34.010> be

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
now as you can see the triangles can be

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.850 
now as you can see the triangles can be
used<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.850> fill<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.420> plane<00:00:35.690> quite<00:00:36.079> easily<00:00:36.320> you

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
used to fill the plane quite easily you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.260 
used to fill the plane quite easily you
can<00:00:37.040> keep<00:00:37.250> copying<00:00:37.670> them<00:00:37.880> this<00:00:38.840> point<00:00:39.290> here<00:00:39.680> is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
can keep copying them this point here is

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.940 
can keep copying them this point here is
exactly<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:41.540> distance<00:00:42.110> away<00:00:42.320> from<00:00:42.559> that

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
exactly this distance away from that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.910 
exactly this distance away from that
point<00:00:43.190> here<00:00:43.489> but<00:00:44.059> it's<00:00:44.180> also<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.660> copy<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
point here but it's also a copy of the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.700 
point here but it's also a copy of the
same<00:00:46.160> point<00:00:46.489> in<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:46.940> triangle<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.559> on

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
same point in this triangle and so on

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.380 
same point in this triangle and so on
and<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:48.920> forth<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:51.170> now<00:00:51.670> let's<00:00:52.670> give<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
and so forth so now let's give the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.780 
and so forth so now let's give the
angles<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.079> Triangle<00:00:54.860> we<00:00:55.190> just<00:00:55.399> use<00:00:55.550> one

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
angles in the Triangle we just use one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.330 
angles in the Triangle we just use one
of<00:00:55.820> them<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.239> give<00:00:56.629> them<00:00:56.660> names<00:00:57.079> as<00:00:57.469> per<00:00:58.160> our

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
of them and give them names as per our

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.090 
of them and give them names as per our
convention<00:00:59.000> will<00:00:59.210> use<00:00:59.420> Greek<00:00:59.780> letters<00:01:00.110> so

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
convention will use Greek letters so

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.609 
convention will use Greek letters so
alpha<00:01:01.820> beta<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.780> gamma<00:01:04.540> how<00:01:05.540> now<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:06.590> we

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
alpha beta and gamma how now can we

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.100 
alpha beta and gamma how now can we
prove<00:01:07.010> that<00:01:07.070> T's<00:01:07.640> add<00:01:07.880> up<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.299> 180<00:01:08.690> degrees

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
prove that T's add up to 180 degrees

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.100 
prove that T's add up to 180 degrees
well<00:01:09.710> let's<00:01:10.670> start<00:01:10.820> drawing<00:01:11.270> lines<00:01:11.570> through

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
well let's start drawing lines through

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.660 
well let's start drawing lines through
them<00:01:12.290> through<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.369> triangles<00:01:13.970> like<00:01:14.600> this

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
them through the triangles like this

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.940 
them through the triangles like this
these<00:01:16.670> red<00:01:16.939> lines<00:01:17.210> are<00:01:17.570> just<00:01:17.869> extensions<00:01:18.470> of

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
these red lines are just extensions of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.910 
these red lines are just extensions of
some<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.180> lines<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.840> triangle<00:01:21.260> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
some of the lines on the triangle and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.590 
some of the lines on the triangle and
what<00:01:22.100> I'm<00:01:22.189> going<00:01:22.400> to<00:01:22.460> be<00:01:22.520> concentrating<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:23.450> is

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
what I'm going to be concentrating on is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.210 
what I'm going to be concentrating on is
this<00:01:23.900> area<00:01:24.470> here<00:01:25.810> now<00:01:26.810> firstly<00:01:27.290> as<00:01:27.590> we<00:01:27.950> saw<00:01:28.100> in

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this area here now firstly as we saw in

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.740 
this area here now firstly as we saw in
the<00:01:28.250> previous<00:01:28.610> video<00:01:28.820> if<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.360> have<00:01:29.479> two

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
the previous video if you have two

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.359 
the previous video if you have two
crossing<00:01:30.229> lines<00:01:30.470> like<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:32.259> or<00:01:33.259> an<00:01:33.860> actual

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
crossing lines like that or an actual

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.870 
crossing lines like that or an actual
fact<00:01:34.790> like<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.540> one<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:38.330> one<00:01:38.390> here

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
fact like this one and this one here

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.690 
fact like this one and this one here
then<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.119> opposite<00:01:41.630> angles<00:01:42.200> are<00:01:42.700> identical

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
then the opposite angles are identical

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.539 
then the opposite angles are identical
so<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.360> other<00:01:44.450> words<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.159> angle<00:01:46.159> there<00:01:46.369> is

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
so in other words that angle there is

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.390 
so in other words that angle there is
betta<00:01:47.479> just<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.229> this<00:01:48.380> angle<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:49.130> these

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
betta just like this angle because these

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.249 
betta just like this angle because these
lines<00:01:49.990> cross<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:51.650> point<00:01:52.840> what<00:01:53.840> else<00:01:54.020> can

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
lines cross in that point what else can

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.280 
lines cross in that point what else can
we<00:01:54.320> find<00:01:54.590> out<00:01:54.740> well<00:01:55.600> because<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.869> triangle

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
we find out well because this triangle

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.830 
we find out well because this triangle
is<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> copy<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.310> triangle<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:59.210> angle<00:01:59.689> is

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
is a copy of that triangle that angle is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.620 
is a copy of that triangle that angle is
alpha<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:03.159> therefore<00:02:04.159> again<00:02:04.640> if<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.360> look<00:02:05.450> at

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
alpha and therefore again if you look at

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.440 
alpha and therefore again if you look at
these<00:02:05.780> two<00:02:06.049> lines<00:02:06.290> here<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.700> opposite<00:02:08.060> angle

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
these two lines here the opposite angle

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.910 
these two lines here the opposite angle
is<00:02:08.599> identical<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.829> that's<00:02:10.429> alpha

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
is identical so that's alpha

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.330 
is identical so that's alpha
finally<00:02:15.280> we'll<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:18.590> these

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
finally we'll see that this here these

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.150 
finally we'll see that this here these
this<00:02:19.730> line<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:21.380> parallel<00:02:21.530> with<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.220> line<00:02:24.550> and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
this line is parallel with that line and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.199 
this line is parallel with that line and
this<00:02:28.160> angle<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.930> gamma<00:02:30.319> is<00:02:30.700> copied<00:02:31.700> there

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
this angle here gamma is copied there

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.930 
this angle here gamma is copied there
because<00:02:32.600> it's<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.870> copy<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.380> triangle<00:02:34.010> so

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
because it's a copy of that triangle so

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.210 
because it's a copy of that triangle so
that<00:02:35.150> angle<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.840> gabba<00:02:38.319> but<00:02:39.319> of<00:02:39.410> course<00:02:39.650> this

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
that angle is gabba but of course this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.110 
that angle is gabba but of course this
here<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.269> line<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:45.489> those<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:46.850> line

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
here this line is and those this line

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.309 
here this line is and those this line
here<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.569> parallel<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:49.010> line<00:02:49.310> there<00:02:50.319> so

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
here is parallel with that line there so

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.570 
here is parallel with that line there so
that<00:02:51.790> corner<00:02:52.790> there<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.120> gamma<00:02:53.750> as<00:02:54.019> well<00:02:54.580> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that corner there is gamma as well and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.390 
that corner there is gamma as well and
then<00:02:55.819> again<00:02:56.120> we<00:02:56.390> use<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:57.350> fact<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.739> opposite

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
then again we use the fact that opposite

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.509 
then again we use the fact that opposite
corners<00:02:58.790> identical<00:02:59.600> than<00:02:59.780> two<00:02:59.959> lines<00:03:00.200> cross

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
corners identical than two lines cross

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.050 
corners identical than two lines cross
to<00:03:01.519> prove<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:02.470> corner<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.620> gamma<00:03:04.060> so

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
to prove that that corner is gamma so

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.789 
to prove that that corner is gamma so
now<00:03:05.860> we've<00:03:06.860> got<00:03:07.130> all<00:03:07.340> these<00:03:08.410> angles<00:03:09.410> here

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
now we've got all these angles here

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.110 
now we've got all these angles here
named<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:13.640> look<00:03:13.790> at<00:03:13.880> all<00:03:14.000> these

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
named but if you look at all these

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.550 
named but if you look at all these
angles<00:03:14.600> they<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:16.220> occupy<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.819> whole<00:03:17.560> area

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
angles they now occupy the whole area

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.640 
angles they now occupy the whole area
there<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.850> they<00:03:20.030> represent<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.690> full<00:03:21.019> circle

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
there so they represent a full circle

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.180 
there so they represent a full circle
which<00:03:22.489> by<00:03:23.359> convention<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.140> 360<00:03:25.070> degrees<00:03:27.190> but

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
which by convention is 360 degrees but

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.099 
which by convention is 360 degrees but
the<00:03:28.430> three<00:03:28.670> dot<00:03:28.820> 60<00:03:29.180> degrees<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.750> made<00:03:29.959> up<00:03:30.079> by

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
the three dot 60 degrees is made up by

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.920 
the three dot 60 degrees is made up by
alpha<00:03:30.799> plus<00:03:31.100> gamma<00:03:31.340> plus<00:03:31.790> beta<00:03:32.269> plus<00:03:32.510> alpha

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
alpha plus gamma plus beta plus alpha

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.150 
alpha plus gamma plus beta plus alpha
plus<00:03:33.170> gamma<00:03:33.320> plus<00:03:33.620> beta<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:35.590> well<00:03:36.590> if<00:03:36.890> that's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
plus gamma plus beta so well if that's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.250 
plus gamma plus beta so well if that's
the<00:03:37.280> case<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:39.670> two<00:03:40.670> times<00:03:41.000> because<00:03:41.750> alpha

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
the case then two times because alpha

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.530 
the case then two times because alpha
plus<00:03:42.500> alpha<00:03:42.920> 2<00:03:43.100> alpha<00:03:43.220> beta<00:03:43.760> plus<00:03:44.000> betas<00:03:44.359> to

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
plus alpha 2 alpha beta plus betas to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.440 
plus alpha 2 alpha beta plus betas to
beat<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.170> on<00:03:45.350> two<00:03:45.950> times<00:03:46.250> alpha<00:03:46.519> +<00:03:47.090> beta<00:03:47.120> +

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
beat and so on two times alpha + beta +

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.890 
beat and so on two times alpha + beta +
gamma<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.170> 360<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.250> therefore<00:03:50.209> quite

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
gamma is 360 and therefore quite

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.479 
gamma is 360 and therefore quite
trivially<00:03:51.530> alpha<00:03:52.459> +<00:03:52.700> beta<00:03:52.730> +<00:03:53.090> gamma<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.750> 180<00:03:54.590> so

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
trivially alpha + beta + gamma is 180 so

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.080 
trivially alpha + beta + gamma is 180 so
these<00:03:55.730> three<00:03:56.150> angles<00:03:57.079> add<00:03:57.410> up<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:58.700> Andhra

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
these three angles add up to Andhra

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:10.540 
these three angles add up to Andhra
native<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.630> that's<00:04:00.230> what<00:04:00.410> we<00:04:00.530> have<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.829> prove

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.610
