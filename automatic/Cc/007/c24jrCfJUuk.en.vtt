00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
today we're gonna talk about training to

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
today we're gonna talk about training to
the<00:00:30.860> pain<00:00:31.160> barrier<00:00:31.490> and<00:00:31.760> slightly<00:00:32.119> past<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.689> in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
the pain barrier and slightly past it in

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.520 
the pain barrier and slightly past it in
training<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:34.850> failure<00:00:35.059> which<00:00:35.930> are<00:00:36.200> two

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
training to failure which are two

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.990 
training to failure which are two
completely<00:00:37.010> different<00:00:37.250> things<00:00:37.580> they<00:00:37.910> have

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
completely different things they have

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000 
completely different things they have
people<00:00:38.180> going<00:00:38.449> well<00:00:39.080> I<00:00:39.140> trained<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.559> failure<00:00:39.830> I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
people going well I trained to failure I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.350 
people going well I trained to failure I
did<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.340> whole<00:00:40.520> thing<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.790> didn't<00:00:41.000> work

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
did the whole thing it didn't work

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360 
did the whole thing it didn't work
no<00:00:41.900> really<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.559> didn't<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:42.890> train<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
no really you didn't you train to the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.220 
no really you didn't you train to the
pain<00:00:43.670> barrier<00:00:43.910> where<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:44.270> hurt<00:00:44.510> maybe

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
pain barrier where it hurt maybe

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.689 
pain barrier where it hurt maybe
slightly<00:00:45.620> passed<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.250> didn't<00:00:46.460> train<00:00:46.610> to

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
slightly passed but you didn't train to

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.869 
slightly passed but you didn't train to
failure<00:00:48.040> when<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.129> trained<00:00:49.400> to<00:00:49.460> failure

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
failure when you trained to failure

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.610 
failure when you trained to failure
about<00:00:50.239> halfway<00:00:50.750> through<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.229> set<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.530> were

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
about halfway through the set you were

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.240 
about halfway through the set you were
in<00:00:51.739> extreme<00:00:52.339> pain<00:00:53.120> ok<00:00:53.900> extreme<00:00:54.379> pain<00:00:54.620> maybe<00:00:55.070> at

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
in extreme pain ok extreme pain maybe at

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.290 
in extreme pain ok extreme pain maybe at
a<00:00:55.280> quarter<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.729> the<00:00:55.790> way<00:00:55.879> through<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.120> set

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
a quarter of the way through the set

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.509 
a quarter of the way through the set
you're<00:00:56.420> an<00:00:56.570> extreme<00:00:57.050> pain<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:58.190> it's<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.430> the

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
you're an extreme pain and it's to the

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.920 
you're an extreme pain and it's to the
part<00:00:58.699> where<00:00:58.790> somebody<00:00:59.030> has<00:00:59.150> like<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.360> match<00:00:59.659> or

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
part where somebody has like a match or

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.380 
part where somebody has like a match or
lighter<00:00:59.960> holding<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.830> flame<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.970> that<00:01:02.120> body

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
lighter holding a flame to that body

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.520 
lighter holding a flame to that body
part<00:01:02.659> it<00:01:02.809> hurts<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.290> bad

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
part it hurts so bad

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.700 
part it hurts so bad
and<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:05.479> pain<00:01:05.690> won't<00:01:05.930> increase<00:01:06.260> it'll<00:01:06.530> just

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
and the pain won't increase it'll just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.860 
and the pain won't increase it'll just
stay<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.130> same<00:01:07.159> but<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:07.850> just<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.420> wears<00:01:08.750> on

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
stay the same but it just it wears on

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.690 
stay the same but it just it wears on
you<00:01:08.990> would<00:01:09.170> pulled<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:09.530> down<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.830> draws<00:01:10.130> your

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
you would pulled you down it draws your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.360 
you would pulled you down it draws your
energy<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:12.470> have<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.650> find<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.010> in<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:13.190> go<00:01:13.280> to

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
energy you have to find it in you go to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.670 
energy you have to find it in you go to
pass<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.479> keep<00:01:14.659> going<00:01:14.990> past<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.409> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
pass that to keep going past that and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.080 
pass that to keep going past that and
what<00:01:15.830> you'll<00:01:15.979> notice<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.790> range<00:01:17.000> of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
what you'll notice is the range of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.609 
what you'll notice is the range of
motion<00:01:17.479> will<00:01:17.600> get<00:01:17.720> shorter<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.200> shorter<00:01:18.229> with

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
motion will get shorter and shorter with

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.200 
motion will get shorter and shorter with
the<00:01:18.710> muscle<00:01:19.010> has<00:01:19.130> more<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.520> more<00:01:19.610> fibers<00:01:20.000> fire

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
the muscle has more and more fibers fire

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.910 
the muscle has more and more fibers fire
they'll<00:01:20.780> start<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.049> fatigue<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.530> not<00:01:21.650> be<00:01:21.770> able

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
they'll start to fatigue and not be able

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.890 
they'll start to fatigue and not be able
to<00:01:22.010> fire<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.940> won't<00:01:23.120> be<00:01:23.240> able<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.450> move<00:01:23.690> at

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
to fire and you won't be able to move at

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.540 
to fire and you won't be able to move at
some<00:01:24.080> point<00:01:24.290> know<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:25.040> point<00:01:25.280> when<00:01:25.460> you're

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
some point know that point when you're

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.330 
some point know that point when you're
not<00:01:25.700> moving<00:01:26.060> that's<00:01:26.660> failure<00:01:27.260> that's<00:01:28.010> not<00:01:28.250> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
not moving that's failure that's not the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.950 
not moving that's failure that's not the
pain<00:01:28.490> bear<00:01:28.640> that's<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:28.910> far<00:01:29.120> past<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.810> pain

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
pain bear that's so far past the pain

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.640 
pain bear that's so far past the pain
Mary<00:01:30.260> that's<00:01:30.350> another<00:01:30.710> state<00:01:31.040> okay<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.650> you

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
Mary that's another state okay and you

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.280 
Mary that's another state okay and you
know<00:01:33.800> many<00:01:34.040> people<00:01:34.130> have<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.810> know<00:01:35.840> tried<00:01:36.260> to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
know many people have you know tried to

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.410 
know many people have you know tried to
put<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> whole<00:01:36.740> train<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.130> failure<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.610> not

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
put a whole train to failure and not

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.030 
put a whole train to failure and not
being<00:01:38.570> able<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.810> achieve<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.260> is<00:01:39.560> definitely<00:01:39.980> a

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
being able to achieve it is definitely a

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.610 
being able to achieve it is definitely a
mental<00:01:40.660> struggle<00:01:41.660> or<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.900> mental<00:01:42.200> strength<00:01:42.560> to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
mental struggle or a mental strength to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.520 
mental struggle or a mental strength to
get<00:01:42.860> there<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.810> for<00:01:44.810> years<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.110> thought<00:01:45.320> you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
get there and for years I thought you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.960 
get there and for years I thought you
know<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:45.680> could<00:01:46.040> do<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.310> tried<00:01:46.520> Dori<00:01:46.730> needs

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
know I could do it I tried Dori needs

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.310 
know I could do it I tried Dori needs
training<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.420> didn't<00:01:47.600> work<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.780> well<00:01:48.020> for<00:01:48.080> me

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
training it didn't work that well for me

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.810 
training it didn't work that well for me
because<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.860> my<00:01:49.190> head<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.400> was<00:01:49.520> training<00:01:49.730> to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
because I in my head I was training to

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.430 
because I in my head I was training to
failure<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.630> actually<00:01:50.780> wasn't<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.320> was

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
failure but I actually wasn't I was

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.600 
failure but I actually wasn't I was
training<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.860> pain<00:01:52.070> barrier<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
training to the pain barrier and

he goes boom and they just fails it's

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.080 
he goes boom and they just fails it's
the<00:03:31.709> most<00:03:31.860> bizarre<00:03:32.070> thing<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.970> can

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
actually see complete muscular failure

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.030 
actually see complete muscular failure
for<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.269> worth<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.780> no<00:03:36.959> pain<00:03:37.200> so

for what it's worth and with no pain so
now<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.640> know<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.760> may<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.269> he's<00:03:39.420> got<00:03:39.709> five

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
now you know you may think he's got five

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.110 
now you know you may think he's got five
reps<00:03:41.010> left<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.370> him<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.640> he<00:03:41.700> fails<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.030> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
reps left in him and he fails in the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.449 
reps left in him and he fails in the
next<00:03:42.330> rep<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.380> complete<00:03:43.680> failure<00:03:44.040> but

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
next rep but it's complete failure but

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.479 
next rep but it's complete failure but
there<00:03:44.580> was<00:03:44.700> no<00:03:44.790> signs<00:03:45.239> there's<00:03:45.540> no<00:03:45.630> pain

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
there was no signs there's no pain

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.160 
there was no signs there's no pain
there's<00:03:47.489> no<00:03:47.580> lactic<00:03:48.000> acid<00:03:48.269> buildup<00:03:48.540> nothing

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
there's no lactic acid buildup nothing

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.440 
there's no lactic acid buildup nothing
like<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.650> fails<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.730> that's<00:03:51.209> when

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
like that it just fails so that's when

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.170 
like that it just fails so that's when
you<00:03:51.570> can<00:03:51.690> really<00:03:51.720> step<00:03:52.260> back<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.940> see<00:03:53.940> that's

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
you can really step back in see that's

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.520 
you can really step back in see that's
what<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.390> looks<00:03:54.510> like<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.750> fail<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.230> that's

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
what it looks like to fail and that's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.479 
what it looks like to fail and that's
what<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.769> looks<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.340> pain

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
what it looks like to be in the pain

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.970 
what it looks like to be in the pain
barrier<00:03:56.670> two<00:03:57.450> different<00:03:57.750> things<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.860> aware

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
barrier two different things so be aware

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.650 
barrier two different things so be aware
if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.640> know<00:03:59.730> you're<00:03:59.910> trying<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.450> train

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
if you you know you're trying to train

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.650 
if you you know you're trying to train
to<00:04:00.780> failure<00:04:01.079> it's<00:04:01.230> gonna<00:04:01.350> take<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:02.630> good<00:04:03.630> I

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
to failure it's gonna take you a good I

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.680 
to failure it's gonna take you a good I
mean<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.140> likely<00:04:04.350> probably<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.739> year<00:04:05.250> of

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
mean it's likely probably a year of

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.300 
mean it's likely probably a year of
training<00:04:06.690> under<00:04:06.989> Phil's<00:04:07.290> tutelage<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:08.220> be

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
training under Phil's tutelage to be

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.680 
training under Phil's tutelage to be
able<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.489> actually<00:04:08.610> get<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.209> pushing<00:04:09.450> myself

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
able to actually get to pushing myself

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.180 
able to actually get to pushing myself
to<00:04:10.110> absolute<00:04:10.680> failure<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.570> getting

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
to absolute failure I was getting

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.909 
to absolute failure I was getting
probably<00:04:14.390> 80%<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.480> failure<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.500> know<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.680> what

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
probably 80% to failure you know to what

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.819 
probably 80% to failure you know to what
I<00:04:16.979> perceived<00:04:17.340> was<00:04:17.489> failure<00:04:17.700> until<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.600> kept<00:04:18.900> you

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
I perceived was failure until I kept you

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.229 
I perceived was failure until I kept you
know<00:04:19.859> going<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.430> going<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.820> know<00:04:20.940> one
