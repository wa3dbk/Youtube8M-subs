00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
collars anything with horses they would

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.580 
collars anything with horses they would
sit<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.140> these<00:00:37.140> jaws

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
sit down here like this and these jaws

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.430 
sit down here like this and these jaws
open<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.350> down<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.040> little

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
open up and down here there's a little

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.490 
open up and down here there's a little
push<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.649> down<00:00:44.600> there's<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.750> leather<00:00:45.989> strap

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
push it down there's a leather strap

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.330 
push it down there's a leather strap
that<00:00:46.530> runs<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.140> closes<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that runs up and closes that and the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
that runs up and closes that and the
whole<00:00:50.520> idea<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.329> clamps<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> place<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
whole idea is it clamps it in place and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
whole idea is it clamps it in place and
can<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.100> moved<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.879> why<00:00:54.090> it's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
can be moved around that's why it's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
can be moved around that's why it's
wider<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.579> they're

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
wider in here it's like if they're

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.459 
wider in here it's like if they're
putting<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> horse<00:00:57.360> harness<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.989> anything<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
putting a horse harness or anything it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.010 
putting a horse harness or anything it
holds<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.129> place<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.359> person<00:01:00.809> could

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
holds it in place so the person could

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
holds it in place so the person could
move<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.559> easily<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.460> stitch<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
move it around easily and stitch it I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
move it around easily and stitch it I
don't<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.860> made<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

machine company the history of it it was

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.050 
machine company the history of it it was
actually<00:01:53.970> founded<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> 1858<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.060> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually founded like in 1858 and it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
actually founded like in 1858 and it
looks<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.110> absorbed<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:58.860> another

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
looks like it was absorbed into another

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.450 
looks like it was absorbed into another
company<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> late<00:02:01.040> 1800s<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> don't

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
company in the late 1800s so I don't

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
company in the late 1800s so I don't
know<00:02:02.549> how<00:02:02.729> long<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.180> kept<00:02:03.420> using<00:02:03.840> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
know how long they kept using that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.429 
know how long they kept using that
designation<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.390> means<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.600> reason<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.110> say

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
designation that means the reason I say

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.529 
designation that means the reason I say
that<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.129> can't<00:02:08.399> age<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.970> piece<00:02:09.239> but

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that is I can't age the piece but

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.090 
that is I can't age the piece but
turn-of-the-century<00:02:10.370> maybe<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.489> little

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
turn-of-the-century maybe a little

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.030

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
or maybe a little laughter I don't think

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.440 
or maybe a little laughter I don't think
