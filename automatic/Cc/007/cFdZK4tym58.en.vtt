haven't seen it check it out the links
in<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.980> description<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.670> let<00:00:12.480> me<00:00:12.719> quickly

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
in the description and let me quickly

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.599 
in the description and let me quickly
switch<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.580> rain<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.470> while<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> explain<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
switch the rain on while I explain to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.029 
switch the rain on while I explain to
you<00:00:17.699> how<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> circuitry<00:00:18.600> works<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.740> I've<00:00:19.830> got

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
you how the circuitry works so I've got

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.040 
you how the circuitry works so I've got
three<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.939> rain<00:00:21.150> detectors<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.840> which

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
three of my rain detectors here which

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
three of my rain detectors here which
are<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.350> connected<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> pulsing<00:00:23.609> bat

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
are now connected to a pulsing bat

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.210 
are now connected to a pulsing bat
switch<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.570> as<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> guys<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
switch and as you guys can see this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
switch and as you guys can see this
volunteer<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.449> wet<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.439> bat

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
volunteer just got wet and the bat

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.700 
volunteer just got wet and the bat
switch<00:00:28.980> pulsed<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> went<00:00:30.900> into<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
switch pulsed and went into this and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.240 
switch pulsed and went into this and
get-and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
get-and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.540

this<00:00:32.730> air<00:00:33.149> dispenser<00:00:33.809> timer<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this air dispenser timer so what this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.240 
this air dispenser timer so what this
does<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.540> dispenser<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.680> also

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
does is this dispenser time is also

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.910 
does is this dispenser time is also
connected<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.030> ant<00:00:39.210> gate<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.649> end

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
connected to the ant gate so this end

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
connected to the ant gate so this end
gate<00:00:41.219> will<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.879> send<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.780> pulse<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
gate will also send out one pulse and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.360 
gate will also send out one pulse and
will<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.489> no<00:00:45.180> longer<00:00:45.210> send<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.079> pulses<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
will then no longer send out pulses for

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.240 
will then no longer send out pulses for
five<00:00:47.670> minutes<00:00:48.090> no<00:00:48.719> matter<00:00:48.989> how<00:00:49.680> many<00:00:49.950> block

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
five minutes no matter how many block

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.290 
five minutes no matter how many block
updates<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.000> receives<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.579> by<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
updates it receives and by the time the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.889 
updates it receives and by the time the
rain<00:00:54.600> stops<00:00:55.460> let<00:00:56.460> me<00:00:56.670> quickly<00:00:56.969> show<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
rain stops let me quickly show this to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.000 
rain stops let me quickly show this to
you<00:00:59.420> all<00:01:00.420> those<00:01:00.719> items<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.649> have

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you all those items here will have

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.910 
you all those items here will have
degraded<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:03.239> rain<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.350> 15

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
degraded because rain will take about 15

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.050 
degraded because rain will take about 15
minutes<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.810> then<00:01:06.810> those<00:01:07.729> farmlands<00:01:08.729> here

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
minutes and then those farmlands here

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
minutes and then those farmlands here
will<00:01:09.299> start<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> update<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.530> guys<00:01:10.740> can

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
will start to update and you guys can

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
will start to update and you guys can
see<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.939> ant<00:01:12.150> gate<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> connected<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> tee

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
see the ant gate is connected to a tee

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.130 
see the ant gate is connected to a tee
flip-flop<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.840> switch

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
flip-flop here which will just switch

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710 
flip-flop here which will just switch
states<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.979> soon<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.640> gets<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:18.060> input<00:01:18.210> from

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
states as soon as it gets an input from

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
states as soon as it gets an input from
the<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.799> gate<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.020> they<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.490> dry

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the and gate here and they will now dry

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.179 
the and gate here and they will now dry
out<00:01:23.729> those<00:01:24.090> pieces<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.659> homeland<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.979> go

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
out those pieces of homeland and will go

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.760 
out those pieces of homeland and will go
through<00:01:26.220> eight<00:01:27.090> different<00:01:27.259> stages<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.439> think

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
through eight different stages I think

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
through eight different stages I think
it<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> someone<00:01:29.790> mentioned<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it is someone mentioned this in the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
it is someone mentioned this in the
comments<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.170> last<00:01:31.439> video<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.549> guys

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
comments of my last video and you guys

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
comments of my last video and you guys
can<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.570> polls<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
can see one of them polls but all of

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.480 
can see one of them polls but all of
them<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.579> still<00:01:35.759> wet<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.130> because

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
them are still wet and this is because

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.219 
them are still wet and this is because
they<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:39.000> trigger<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.509> seven<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.140> eight

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they will trigger like seven or eight

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.050 
they will trigger like seven or eight
block<00:01:40.799> updates<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.829> that's<00:01:43.829> why<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.700> need<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
block updates so that's why you need to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.469 
block updates so that's why you need to
deactivate<00:01:45.240> further<00:01:46.140> inputs<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.240> five

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
deactivate further inputs for the five

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690 
deactivate further inputs for the five
minute<00:01:48.840> period<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> five

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
minute period here and when the five

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.389 
minute period here and when the five
minutes<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.619> those<00:01:52.829> farmlands

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
minutes are over all of those farmlands

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.550 
minutes are over all of those farmlands
will<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.850> dry<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.689> detector<00:01:55.200> will<00:01:55.409> be

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
will be dry and the detector will be

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.620 
will be dry and the detector will be
able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.979> detect<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.759> next<00:01:56.790> rain<00:01:57.439> which<00:01:58.439> will

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
able to detect the next rain which will

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.010 
able to detect the next rain which will
occur<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.990> every<00:02:01.590> two<00:02:01.890> hours<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.729> those<00:02:03.030> five

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
occur like every two hours so those five

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.430 
occur like every two hours so those five
minutes<00:02:06.380> recreation<00:02:07.380> periods<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.369> call<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
minutes recreation periods you call it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.680 
minutes recreation periods you call it
doesn't<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.619> matter

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
doesn't really matter

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.730 
doesn't really matter
and<00:02:11.780> yeah<00:02:12.470> that's<00:02:12.680> basically<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.610> circuit<00:02:14.060> on

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
and yeah that's basically the circuit on

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.890 
and yeah that's basically the circuit on
how<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.800> improve<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.550> rain<00:02:16.970> detector<00:02:17.570> for

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
how to improve this rain detector for

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.580 
how to improve this rain detector for
father<00:02:18.730> faster<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.060> more<00:02:20.540> reliable<00:02:21.110> rain<00:02:21.380> off

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
father faster and more reliable rain off

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.130 
father faster and more reliable rain off
detection<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.880> rain<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.420> detection<00:02:23.840> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
detection the rain on detection is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.410 
detection the rain on detection is
basically<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.920> same<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.910> thing

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
basically the same as but this thing

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.810 
basically the same as but this thing
here<00:02:26.660> but<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.200> guys<00:02:27.320> can<00:02:27.530> see<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:28.580> rain

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
here but as you guys can see this rain

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.170 
here but as you guys can see this rain
detector<00:02:29.330> now<00:02:29.510> shows<00:02:29.920> rain<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.190> even<00:02:31.760> though

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
detector now shows rain on even though

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.240 
detector now shows rain on even though
it's<00:02:32.390> off<00:02:32.630> because<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.470> farm<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.980> hasn't

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's off because this farm that hasn't

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.080 
it's off because this farm that hasn't
fully<00:02:34.610> dried<00:02:35.600> out<00:02:35.810> yet<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.520> as<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.910> night

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
fully dried out yet and as the night

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.480 
fully dried out yet and as the night
falls<00:02:38.480> with<00:02:38.990> this<00:02:39.200> beautiful<00:02:39.830> sunset<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.520> I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
falls with this beautiful sunset here I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.190 
falls with this beautiful sunset here I
