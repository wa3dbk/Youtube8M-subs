the<00:00:01.350> next<00:00:01.709> step<00:00:01.949> in<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.460> cycle<00:00:02.700> after

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
the next step in the cycle after

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.210 
the next step in the cycle after
thinking<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:04.140> begin<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.440> ask<00:00:04.770> yourself

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
thinking is to begin to ask yourself

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.490 
thinking is to begin to ask yourself
questions<00:00:05.420> much<00:00:06.420> like<00:00:06.720> we<00:00:06.899> did<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.140> mr.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
questions much like we did with mr.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.770 
questions much like we did with mr.
bumble<00:00:07.799> Meyer<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.240> help<00:00:09.450> teachers

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
bumble Meyer this is to help teachers

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.230 
bumble Meyer this is to help teachers
distinguish<00:00:10.530> between<00:00:10.710> pertinent<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
distinguish between pertinent and a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.620 
distinguish between pertinent and a
revelant<00:00:12.719> information<00:00:14.120> questions<00:00:15.120> may<00:00:15.299> start

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
revelant information questions may start

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.830 
revelant information questions may start
out<00:00:15.780> as<00:00:15.990> very<00:00:16.350> broad<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.060> wonder

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
out as very broad like what is I wonder

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.970 
out as very broad like what is I wonder
why<00:00:19.020> or<00:00:19.560> golly<00:00:20.039> gee<00:00:20.369> could<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.859> but<00:00:22.859> as

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
why or golly gee could it be that but as

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.950 
why or golly gee could it be that but as
teachers<00:00:23.490> become<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:24.180> precise<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.869> their

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
teachers become more precise in their

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
teachers become more precise in their
thinking<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.710> questions<00:00:26.250> become<00:00:26.460> more

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
thinking the questions become more

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
thinking the questions become more
detailed<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.480> direct<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:29.279> should<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
detailed and direct like what should I

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.200 
detailed and direct like what should I
have<00:00:29.670> done<00:00:30.199> what<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.500> next<00:00:31.769> time<00:00:32.210> why

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
have done what can I do next time why

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.139 
have done what can I do next time why
did<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> react<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.110> way<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
did I react that way and what have I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.380 
did I react that way and what have I

mr.<00:01:24.329> Palomar<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:28.319> next<00:01:28.710> step<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> reflection

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
mr. Palomar the next step is reflection

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.389 
mr. Palomar the next step is reflection
and<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.810> order<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.110> reflect<00:01:31.469> teachers<00:01:32.219> must

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
and in order to reflect teachers must

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.270 
and in order to reflect teachers must
clarify<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.659> thinking<00:01:34.079> about

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
they must shed some light on what has

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.940 
they must shed some light on what has
occurred<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:38.280> mr.<00:01:38.789> bumble<00:01:39.090> Mayer<00:01:39.240> has

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
occurred just like mr. bumble Mayer has

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
occurred just like mr. bumble Mayer has
there<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.069> two<00:01:41.340> types<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.880> reflection

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
there are two types of reflection

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.649 
there are two types of reflection
reflection<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.860> action<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.640> reflection<00:01:45.539> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
reflection on action and reflection and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.520 
reflection on action and reflection and
action<00:01:47.240> reflection<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.360> action<00:01:48.569> occurs<00:01:49.079> when

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
action reflection on action occurs when

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
action reflection on action occurs when
teachers<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.009> able<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.849> question

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
teachers are able to think and question

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.679 
teachers are able to think and question
events<00:01:52.079> actions<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.069> conversations<00:01:53.939> after

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
events actions or conversations after

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.770 
events actions or conversations after
they<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.049> already<00:01:55.259> occurred<00:01:56.630> reflection<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
they have already occurred reflection in

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.749 
they have already occurred reflection in
action<00:01:58.319> occurs<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.920> teachers<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.429> thinking

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
action occurs when teachers are thinking

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.429 
action occurs when teachers are thinking
about<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.209> they're<00:02:00.450> doing<00:02:00.479> while<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.380> are

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
doing it this type of reflection has a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.889 
doing it this type of reflection has a
sense<00:02:04.470> of<00:02:04.590> urgency<00:02:04.860> about<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:06.119> no<00:02:06.390> students
