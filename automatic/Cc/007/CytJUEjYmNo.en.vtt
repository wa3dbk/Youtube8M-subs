00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
under my foot it also releases my

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.909 
under my foot it also releases my
tension<00:05:56.370> on<00:05:56.849> my<00:05:57.090> upper<00:05:57.479> thread<00:05:57.840> so<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.560> my

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
tension on my upper thread so that my

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.510 
tension on my upper thread so that my
threads<00:05:59.310> will<00:05:59.639> release<00:06:00.030> easily<00:06:01.070> so<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.280> free

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
threads will release easily so the free

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.339 
threads will release easily so the free
hand<00:06:02.759> system<00:06:02.909> is<00:06:03.389> definitely<00:06:04.020> another

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349
