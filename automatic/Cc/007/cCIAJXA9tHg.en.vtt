00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
thing was most clients were a patient we

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
thing was most clients were a patient we
had<00:01:40.920> waiting<00:01:41.280> lists<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.729> could<00:01:41.939> fulfill

had waiting lists and we could fulfill

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
had waiting lists and we could fulfill
them<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> keeps<00:01:43.320> happening<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
them but it keeps happening here and

them but it keeps happening here and
there<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.360> purpose

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
there and it's not really on purpose

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.590 
there and it's not really on purpose
it's<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> over

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it's just that I don't like to over

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's just that I don't like to over
produce<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.469> we<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.860> what's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
produce because we all know what's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.270 
produce because we all know what's
happening<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.670> our<00:01:50.759> production<00:01:55.159> well<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
happening with our production well on a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
happening with our production well on a
consumer<00:01:56.820> side<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.869> perhaps

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
consumer side and then that's perhaps

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.800 
consumer side and then that's perhaps
very<00:01:58.500> subjective<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.280> prefer<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> clear

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
very subjective I prefer to have a clear
