and basically remove those with a
screwdriver<00:01:04.519> we're<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> check<00:01:05.910> them<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
screwdriver we're going to check them to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120

make sure they're clean you go ahead and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
make sure they're clean you go ahead and
hold<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:08.940> sunlight<00:01:09.210> whatever

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
hold them up to some sunlight whatever

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
hold them up to some sunlight whatever
it<00:01:10.259> is<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:10.979> through<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.729> little

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it is so you can see through the little

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.170 
it is so you can see through the little
hole<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.740> basically<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.190> if<00:01:14.520> they're

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
clean or if they're clogged so you can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.630 
clean or if they're clogged so you can
see<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.780> hole<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.440> them<00:01:24.560> okay

see the little hole there on them okay

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.889 
see the little hole there on them okay
now<00:01:26.640> sometimes<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.300> they're<00:01:27.450> clogged<00:01:27.660> what<00:01:27.869> I

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
now sometimes if they're clogged what I

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.660 
now sometimes if they're clogged what I
would<00:01:28.110> recommend<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.369> ahead<00:01:29.580> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
would recommend to do is go ahead and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.810 
would recommend to do is go ahead and
take<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> wire<00:01:30.119> brush<00:01:30.149> or<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.649> tar<00:01:32.280> string<00:01:32.640> or

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it out back and forth with it as much as

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.930 
it out back and forth with it as much as
you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.160> basically<00:01:38.580> clean<00:01:38.820> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that hole so the gas will flow through

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.289 
that hole so the gas will flow through
it<00:01:41.640> evenly<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.140> main<00:01:43.350> jet<00:01:44.240> see<00:01:45.240> how

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it evenly this is your main jet see how

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
it evenly this is your main jet see how
you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.689> through<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:45.960> hole<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.290> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you can see through a hole there you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.170 
you can see through a hole there you

the inside I'd recommend buying some

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.920 
the inside I'd recommend buying some
carburetor<00:01:50.159> cleaner<00:01:50.479> just<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.689> through
