this<00:00:10.790> exercise<00:00:11.120> is<00:00:11.480> known<00:00:11.630> as<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.900> crunch

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
this exercise is known as the crunch

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.990 
this exercise is known as the crunch
we're<00:00:12.410> going<00:00:12.530> to<00:00:12.590> work<00:00:12.770> the<00:00:13.310> tree<00:00:13.550> trunk<00:00:13.820> the

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
we're going to work the tree trunk the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.610 
we're going to work the tree trunk the
middle<00:00:14.300> of<00:00:14.390> the<00:00:14.480> body<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.870> part<00:00:15.170> of<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.410> body

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
middle of the body the part of the body

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.770 
middle of the body the part of the body
that<00:00:15.800> holds<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.279> firm<00:00:16.640> and<00:00:16.910> safe<00:00:17.210> through

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
that holds you firm and safe through

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.330 
that holds you firm and safe through
every<00:00:18.200> single<00:00:18.380> movement<00:00:18.770> that<00:00:19.010> you<00:00:19.130> make

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
every single movement that you make

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.160 
every single movement that you make
every<00:00:19.700> day<00:00:19.730> as<00:00:20.270> well<00:00:20.570> as<00:00:20.690> in<00:00:20.780> moving<00:00:21.080> the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
every day as well as in moving the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.170 
every day as well as in moving the
weights<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.010> we're<00:00:22.130> going<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:22.310> focus<00:00:22.610> on<00:00:22.940> how

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
weights so we're going to focus on how

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.380 
weights so we're going to focus on how
do<00:00:23.240> we<00:00:23.510> really<00:00:24.050> work<00:00:24.260> those<00:00:24.530> intense<00:00:25.369> safe<00:00:26.060> and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
do we really work those intense safe and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.029 
do we really work those intense safe and
effective<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.380> we're<00:00:27.500> gonna<00:00:27.590> start<00:00:27.920> off<00:00:28.010> with

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
effective so we're gonna start off with

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.010 
effective so we're gonna start off with
a<00:00:28.190> basic<00:00:28.580> crunch<00:00:28.730> on<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.300> bench<00:00:29.510> here<00:00:29.840> right

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
a basic crunch on the bench here right

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.200 
a basic crunch on the bench here right
now<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.710> easiest<00:00:31.160> probably<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.029> most

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
now the easiest probably the most

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.700 
now the easiest probably the most
sensible<00:00:32.569> area<00:00:32.929> to<00:00:33.050> start<00:00:33.260> with<00:00:33.409> is<00:00:33.499> with<00:00:33.649> the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
sensible area to start with is with the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.500 
sensible area to start with is with the
feet<00:00:34.010> down<00:00:34.280> that<00:00:34.550> way<00:00:34.999> you<00:00:35.059> don't<00:00:35.269> have<00:00:35.390> to

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
feet down that way you don't have to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.360 
feet down that way you don't have to
worry<00:00:35.749> about<00:00:35.899> supporting<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:36.559> weight<00:00:36.710> same

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
worry about supporting the weight same

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.889 
worry about supporting the weight same
again<00:00:37.640> you'll<00:00:37.789> notice<00:00:38.030> underneath<00:00:38.569> here

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
again you'll notice underneath here

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.229 
again you'll notice underneath here
always<00:00:39.649> have<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.129> back<00:00:40.339> flat<00:00:40.729> to<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:40.969> bench

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
always have the back flat to the bench

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.329 
always have the back flat to the bench
then<00:00:41.749> always<00:00:42.140> simply<00:00:42.469> do<00:00:42.620> from<00:00:42.829> here<00:00:43.100> this

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
then always simply do from here this

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.910 
then always simply do from here this
Brian<00:00:43.640> is<00:00:43.789> about<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.149> do<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:44.420> curl<00:00:44.690> up<00:00:44.899> slow<00:00:45.649> and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
Brian is about to do is curl up slow and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.430 
Brian is about to do is curl up slow and
control<00:00:46.639> we're<00:00:46.909> looking<00:00:47.179> 2<00:00:47.449> to<00:00:47.659> 4<00:00:47.870> seconds<00:00:48.319> up

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
control we're looking 2 to 4 seconds up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.439 
control we're looking 2 to 4 seconds up
full<00:00:49.159> range<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.550> movement<00:00:49.699> on<00:00:50.059> this<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.359> only

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
full range of movement on this is only

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.959 
full range of movement on this is only
about<00:00:50.719> 30<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.260> 40<00:00:51.559> degrees<00:00:51.889> all<00:00:52.460> we're<00:00:52.699> doing

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
about 30 to 40 degrees all we're doing

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.569 
about 30 to 40 degrees all we're doing
is<00:00:53.089> flexing<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:53.899> extending<00:00:54.229> the<00:00:54.710> spine<00:00:54.979> this

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
is flexing and extending the spine this

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.860 
is flexing and extending the spine this
is<00:00:55.729> perfect<00:00:56.120> when<00:00:56.269> we<00:00:56.359> get<00:00:56.510> up<00:00:56.600> there<00:00:56.719> there's

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
is perfect when we get up there there's

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.569 
is perfect when we get up there there's
a<00:00:56.929> slight<00:00:57.199> pause<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:57.679> he's<00:00:57.799> squeezing<00:00:58.280> in

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
a slight pause so he's squeezing in

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.430 
a slight pause so he's squeezing in
tight<00:00:58.609> it's<00:00:59.149> holding<00:00:59.510> those<00:00:59.659> washboard<00:00:59.989> abs

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
tight it's holding those washboard abs

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.619 
tight it's holding those washboard abs
in<00:01:00.679> tight<00:01:00.949> as<00:01:01.670> he<00:01:01.819> does<00:01:01.999> that<00:01:02.149> you'll<00:01:02.299> notice

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
in tight as he does that you'll notice

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.389 
in tight as he does that you'll notice
he<00:01:02.780> comes<00:01:03.019> up<00:01:03.199> there's<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.709> gap<00:01:03.979> between<00:01:04.190> his

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
he comes up there's a gap between his

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.550 
he comes up there's a gap between his
chin<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:04.850> chest<00:01:05.059> just<00:01:05.869> imagine<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.439> were

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
chin and chest just imagine you were

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.590 
chin and chest just imagine you were
holding<00:01:06.890> an<00:01:07.009> orange<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.880> idea<00:01:08.149> is<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.329> keep

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
holding an orange the idea is to keep

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.109 
holding an orange the idea is to keep
that<00:01:08.869> gap<00:01:09.110> there<00:01:09.289> all<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.920> way<00:01:10.039> through<00:01:10.430> slow

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
that gap there all the way through slow

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.429 
that gap there all the way through slow
and<00:01:11.270> controlled<00:01:11.450> as<00:01:11.780> he's<00:01:11.899> doing<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:12.259> this

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
and controlled as he's doing this this

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.020 
and controlled as he's doing this this
is<00:01:12.560> beautiful<00:01:12.740> now<00:01:13.310> if<00:01:13.399> we<00:01:13.490> want<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.700> take<00:01:13.880> this

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
is beautiful now if we want to take this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.849 
is beautiful now if we want to take this
a<00:01:14.090> little<00:01:14.180> further<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.960> little<00:01:15.439> bit<00:01:15.619> more

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
a little further a little bit more

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.469 
a little further a little bit more
intense<00:01:16.219> or<00:01:16.369> we<00:01:16.549> simply<00:01:16.759> do<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.119> start<00:01:17.420> by

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
intense or we simply do is start by

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.599 
intense or we simply do is start by
lifting<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.930> legs<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.439> legs<00:01:19.070> parallel<00:01:19.490> to

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
lifting the legs here legs parallel to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.340 
lifting the legs here legs parallel to
the<00:01:19.700> ground<00:01:19.820> knees<00:01:20.149> above<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.539> hips<00:01:20.750> now<00:01:21.289> he

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
the ground knees above the hips now he

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.200 
the ground knees above the hips now he
has<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.829> support<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.280> weight<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.759> legs<00:01:23.000> at

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
has to support the weight of the legs at

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.910 
has to support the weight of the legs at
the<00:01:23.570> same<00:01:23.750> time<00:01:23.990> which<00:01:24.409> means<00:01:24.619> he's<00:01:24.740> got<00:01:24.859> a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
the same time which means he's got a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.429 
the same time which means he's got a
fire<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.820> deep<00:01:26.149> internal<00:01:26.659> muscles<00:01:26.930> inside

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
fire the deep internal muscles inside

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.349 
fire the deep internal muscles inside
his<00:01:27.619> core<00:01:27.859> to<00:01:28.280> keep<00:01:28.460> these<00:01:28.670> legs<00:01:28.939> here<00:01:29.179> because

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
his core to keep these legs here because

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.300 
his core to keep these legs here because
he's<00:01:29.509> got<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.750> keep<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.020> spine<00:01:30.289> in<00:01:30.320> contact<00:01:30.920> we

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
he's got to keep the spine in contact we

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.069 
he's got to keep the spine in contact we
can<00:01:31.460> make<00:01:31.609> this<00:01:31.700> even<00:01:31.880> more<00:01:32.179> intense<00:01:32.600> simply

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
can make this even more intense simply

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.109 
can make this even more intense simply
by<00:01:33.200> moving<00:01:33.380> his<00:01:33.619> hands<00:01:33.829> back<00:01:34.100> still<00:01:34.789> keeping

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
by moving his hands back still keeping

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.730 
by moving his hands back still keeping
his<00:01:35.210> shoulder<00:01:35.539> blades<00:01:35.750> back<00:01:35.899> what<00:01:36.530> have<00:01:36.619> we

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
his shoulder blades back what have we

Brian can do because he has worked at
this<00:01:47.179> for<00:01:47.390> many<00:01:47.570> years<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.990> be<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:48.259> strong<00:01:48.499> I

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
this for many years to be this strong I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.499 
this for many years to be this strong I
put<00:01:49.219> his<00:01:49.340> hands<00:01:49.549> all<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.969> way<00:01:50.060> back<00:01:50.270> his

put his hands all the way back his
weight<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.049> extreme<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.249> intense<00:01:52.789> pressure

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
weight is extreme so intense pressure

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.380 
weight is extreme so intense pressure
here<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> crunch<00:01:55.460> you've<00:01:56.179> got<00:01:56.299> to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
here this is a crunch you've got to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.389 
here this is a crunch you've got to
follow<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.749> form<00:01:57.049> it's<00:01:57.319> not<00:01:57.439> fast<00:01:57.890> it's<00:01:58.159> slow

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
follow this form it's not fast it's slow

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.630 
follow this form it's not fast it's slow
and<00:01:58.549> controlled<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.270> think<00:01:59.600> about<00:01:59.840> this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
and controlled and think about this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.609 
and controlled and think about this
18:24<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.819> these<00:02:01.969> up<00:02:02.450> for<00:02:02.689> about<00:02:02.869> two<00:02:03.140> seconds

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
18:24 of these up for about two seconds

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.800 
18:24 of these up for about two seconds
slight<00:02:03.920> pause<00:02:04.159> down<00:02:04.789> for<00:02:05.270> two<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.450> four

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
slight pause down for two to four

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.320 
slight pause down for two to four
seconds<00:02:06.319> so<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.469> really<00:02:06.859> work<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:07.280> from<00:02:07.999> feet

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
seconds so you really work it from feet

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.730 
seconds so you really work it from feet
close<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.500> body<00:02:09.680> spread<00:02:10.100> out

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
close to the body spread out

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.370 
close to the body spread out
this<00:02:11.070> is<00:02:11.460> how<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.820> do<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> crunch<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.230> how

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
this is how to do a crunch this is how

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.670 
this is how to do a crunch this is how
to<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.830> tree<00:02:14.040> trunk<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.520> life
