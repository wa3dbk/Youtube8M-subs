00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
made this rendering very quickly and it

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.380 
made this rendering very quickly and it
became<00:03:54.110> an<00:03:54.290> icon<00:03:54.709> all<00:03:55.190> over<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.640> Disney<00:03:56.000> parks

and especially Nikon because remember
walking<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.540> world<00:03:59.720> is<00:03:59.990> not<00:04:00.290> any<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.590> this

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709
