think he was probably a little nervous

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.670 
think he was probably a little nervous
too<00:02:55.180> because<00:02:55.299> he<00:02:55.480> wasn't<00:02:55.629> you<00:02:55.900> know<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.019> first

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
too because he wasn't you know I first

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.170 
too because he wasn't you know I first
said<00:02:56.799> exactly<00:02:57.099> sure<00:02:57.400> what<00:02:57.579> he<00:02:57.639> was<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.150> know

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:55.809 
hyped up through the media and even in

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.509 
hyped up through the media and even in
England<00:07:56.139> when<00:07:56.259> i<00:07:56.289> was<00:07:56.409> playing<00:07:56.559> Queens<00:07:57.279> and

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:57.519 
England when i was playing Queens and

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.070 
England when i was playing Queens and
Wimbledon<00:07:57.879> and<00:07:58.029> since<00:07:58.509> then<00:07:58.659> I<00:07:58.689> haven't<00:07:58.899> heard

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 
Wimbledon and since then I haven't heard

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.929 
Wimbledon and since then I haven't heard
anything<00:07:59.259> from<00:07:59.439> them<00:07:59.529> so<00:07:59.860> I<00:08:00.550> don't<00:08:00.819> know<00:08:00.879> I

00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:00.939 
anything from them so I don't know I

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.549 
anything from them so I don't know I
guess<00:08:01.029> they<00:08:01.269> weren't<00:08:01.389> interested<00:08:01.870> as<00:08:02.019> much<00:08:02.319> as

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:02.559 
guess they weren't interested as much as

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:07.379 
guess they weren't interested as much as
it<00:08:03.099> was<00:08:03.839> portrayed<00:08:04.839> in<00:08:05.110> the<00:08:05.259> media
