I just got it wired swing run this thing
on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> bench<00:00:31.380> tester<00:00:31.859> without<00:00:32.099> hooking

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
on the bench tester without hooking

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270 
on the bench tester without hooking
everything<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.660> uh<00:00:34.010> yeah<00:00:35.010> we're

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
everything up on it but uh yeah we're

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549 
everything up on it but uh yeah we're
gonna<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.570> does<00:00:36.870> right<00:00:37.530> now

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
gonna see what this thing does right now

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.090 
gonna see what this thing does right now
battery<00:00:38.190> voltage<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.820> sitting<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.329> about

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
battery voltage is sitting at about

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.910 
battery voltage is sitting at about
living<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.340> over<00:00:41.670> 11<00:00:42.120> volts<00:00:42.620> will<00:00:43.620> cut<00:00:43.800> our

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
living just over 11 volts will cut our

living just over 11 volts will cut our
batteries<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.579> run<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.000> thing<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.600> idle<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
batteries on run this thing up at idle I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.430 
batteries on run this thing up at idle I
just<00:00:46.890> wanted<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> show<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.399> guys<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:48.030> our

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
just wanted to show you guys what our

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.619 
just wanted to show you guys what our
300<00:00:49.440> amp<00:00:49.590> alternators<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.239> idle

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
300 amp alternators will put out at idle

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.510 
300 amp alternators will put out at idle
and<00:00:52.789> I<00:00:53.789> say<00:00:54.120> most<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:54.719> competitors

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
and I say most of our competitors

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.189 
and I say most of our competitors
they're<00:00:56.520> alternators<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.480> even<00:00:57.719> charge<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
they're alternators don't even charge it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.510 
they're alternators don't even charge it
idle<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:58.859> even<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
idle they don't even come with a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
idle they don't even come with a
warranty<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.199> give<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> one-year<00:01:01.890> warranty

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
warranty we do give a one-year warranty

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
warranty we do give a one-year warranty
with<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.110> daily

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
with these also they are good for daily

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.760 
with these also they are good for daily
drivers<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:06.240> help<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> smoke<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
drivers and will help you to smoke the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.390 
drivers and will help you to smoke the
competition<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> shows<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.189> let's<00:01:11.189> run

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
competition at the shows so let's run

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.740 
competition at the shows so let's run
this<00:01:11.549> thing<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> say<00:01:12.299> we're<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
this thing out I say we're just going to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
this thing out I say we're just going to
do<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.960> idle<00:01:13.290> check<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
do it idle check on this thing just to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.980 
do it idle check on this thing just to
see<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.060> power<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.570> getting<00:01:15.869> out

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
see what kind of power we're getting out

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.760 
see what kind of power we're getting out
of<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> we'll<00:01:17.909> cut<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> tester<00:01:18.780> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
of it so we'll cut the tester on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.920 
of it so we'll cut the tester on
get<00:01:20.770> her<00:01:20.860> batteries<00:01:21.369> cut<00:01:21.640> on

a right at 190 years at idle out of this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.760 
a right at 190 years at idle out of this
thing

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.220

Dawg<00:02:26.200> alternators<00:02:27.010> do<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.640> said<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.810> 300

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
Dawg alternators do I said this is a 300

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.940 
Dawg alternators do I said this is a 300
amp<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:31.000> wanted<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.569> shoot<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.319> one<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:32.709> at
