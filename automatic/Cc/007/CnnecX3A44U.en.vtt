they<00:01:43.330> are<00:01:43.660> there<00:01:44.200> really<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.700> varietal

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
they are there really a varietal

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.540 
they are there really a varietal
specific<00:01:46.539> we<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.280> varieties<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.310> will

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
specific we have varieties that will

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.339 
specific we have varieties that will
come<00:01:48.700> into<00:01:48.880> bloom<00:01:49.060> now<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.690> then<00:01:50.110> we<00:01:50.229> have

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
come into bloom now and then we have

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:51.990 
come into bloom now and then we have
varieties<00:01:50.709> that<00:01:50.739> will<00:01:51.069> come<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.729> through<00:01:51.970> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
varieties that will come in through the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.839 
varieties that will come in through the
wintertime<00:01:52.330> last<00:01:53.110> ones<00:01:53.319> typically<00:01:54.099> start

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
wintertime last ones typically start

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.249 
wintertime last ones typically start
blooming<00:01:55.060> around<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.450> first<00:01:55.629> of<00:01:55.720> April<00:01:55.989> or<00:01:56.110> so

now<00:01:56.800> orchids<00:01:57.789> tend<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.090> be<00:01:58.270> epiphytic<00:01:59.140> which

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
now orchids tend to be epiphytic which

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.410 
now orchids tend to be epiphytic which
means<00:01:59.619> they<00:01:59.739> grow<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.190> trees<00:02:00.759> out<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.090> soil

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
means they grow in trees out of soil

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.869 
means they grow in trees out of soil
this<00:02:02.259> looks<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.619> soil<00:02:03.009> but<00:02:03.250> I'm<00:02:03.340> what<00:02:03.759> is
