00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
moving enough oxygen state peak so I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.240 
moving enough oxygen state peak so I
thought<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> did<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.900> put<00:00:28.560> him<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.769> oxygen

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
thought I did have to put him in oxygen

down to the heart the trachea does take

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
down to the heart the trachea does take
up<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> big<00:01:10.229> bin<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:10.799> where<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.070> finger<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
up a big bin right where my finger is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.020 
up a big bin right where my finger is
and<00:01:12.119> narrows<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.890> goes<00:01:14.070> through<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.760> heart

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and narrows as it goes through the heart

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
and narrows as it goes through the heart
and<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:15.479> what's<00:01:15.810> causing<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> silly<00:01:16.650> or

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and that's what's causing the silly or

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.910 
and that's what's causing the silly or
he'd<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.369> much<00:01:17.490> trouble<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.330> he<00:01:18.750> breathes

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
he'd have so much trouble as he breathes

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.039 
he'd have so much trouble as he breathes
he's<00:01:20.340> trying<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> move<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> air<00:01:21.420> past<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
he's trying to move the air past the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.100 
he's trying to move the air past the
band<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> lungs<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
band and and to the lungs and it's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.340 
band and and to the lungs and it's
collapsing<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.360> getting<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.600> narrow<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
collapsing and getting very narrow in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
collapsing and getting very narrow in
the<00:01:28.650> middle<00:01:28.950> section<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.640> up

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the middle section so as you can see up

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
the middle section so as you can see up
at<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> front<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.159> where<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
at the front you can see the where it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
at the front you can see the where it
starts<00:01:36.000> wide<00:01:36.270> where<00:01:36.659> he's<00:01:36.780> trying<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> breathe

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
starts wide where he's trying to breathe

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.399 
starts wide where he's trying to breathe
then<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.369> takes<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.729> band<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> narrows

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
then it takes a band and then it narrows

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.280 
then it takes a band and then it narrows
and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> widens<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> goes<00:01:42.930> into

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and then it widens up as it goes into

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.090 
and then it widens up as it goes into
the<00:01:43.409> lung<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.360> dog<00:01:45.360> might<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.100> allergic

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the lung so a dog might have allergic

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
the lung so a dog might have allergic
reaction<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> thickening<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> might

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
reaction have thickening or it might

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.130 
reaction have thickening or it might
have<00:01:49.170> something<00:01:49.590> pressing<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have something pressing down in here to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.429 
have something pressing down in here to
make<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.220> windpipe<00:01:53.759> band<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> also<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> make

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
make that windpipe band and also to make

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100 
make that windpipe band and also to make
it<00:01:55.470> narrowed<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:57.119> breathe<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> try

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it narrowed as they breathe in and try

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.039 
it narrowed as they breathe in and try
to<00:01:58.200> move<00:01:58.469> air<00:01:58.680> past<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.399> but<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> lungs<00:02:00.689> look

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to move air past that but the lungs look

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.069 
to move air past that but the lungs look
fairly<00:02:01.590> inflated<00:02:02.520> there's<00:02:03.329> black<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.899> there

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
fairly inflated there's black in there

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.080 
fairly inflated there's black in there
