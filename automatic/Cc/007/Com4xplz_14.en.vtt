 links in the bobo bob description 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello to you, it's tony today 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.570
 so we find ourselves for a new 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.350
 video a new elite weapon this time 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.029
 here we are with the so-called weapon the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.580
 more horsepower shotguns 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.650
 the bulldog faith hammer so I say 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.380
 that because me during the use of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 this weapon for my master-of-arms challenges 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.750
 for keeping in gold and diamonds 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.489
 I did not find the faith hammer 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 especially chit certainly a bomb 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.230
 but by tchitÃ© in any case so this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 gameplay the arrival during a point 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.239
 strategic so sure I knew that 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.860
 it was the fashion terrace seems to me no 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.500
 it's not terrace I know more he me 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.149
 sense that these terraces and so I 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.399
 did not have any assets no accessories 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.660
 I was doing the challenges so 150 they 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.059
 go away all in accessories made 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.559
 both at the same time and so I have not 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.489
 not all accessories do not have 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.680
 looters in order to make 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.539
 ammunition to be able to be prone to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.129
 your ammo no stealthy impulses this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.560
 which makes every time I bust I 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.689
 am detectable at death no 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.799
 robustness by rowing gg nothing and more 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.080
 I have no accessories so I even 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.130
 not load big cape and so it's 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.100
 not what I 'm going to stick to the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.140
 ideal class I think for girls to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 pump and the bulldog nearly dies 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.970
 because I think about rifles to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.409
 pump is not really any accessories 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.360
 others I think we should use 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 except load of large capes and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.700
 advanced stripes since got to advance 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.680
 you better parts and what is 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.360
 always good to take and change of 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.750
 cap war more ammo recharge my 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.189
 etc. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.070
 I think it's really both 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.810
 important accessories to use in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.130
 all cases then if you want 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.119
 add a third is aimed at the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 war is for me a preference 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.200
 but it's really not obligatory me 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060
 I not consider its compulsory at least 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.110
 and then we all really allow 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.860
 what you 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.170
 to ride by imagining me as robust a pawn 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.720
 stealthy and go-getter that will allow you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 so run and shoot a time without 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.260
 targeted because in three quarters of the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 time to shotgun shot you without 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.190
 at least that's what you have to do 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 if you do not do it then I will 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.759
 advise to do that if you use 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.500
 this shotgun the lover otherwise it's 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.660
 fun of exchange a little bit of weapons and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.580
 it's an access but it's really not 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.830
 all parts of the world where I have 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.480
 could make 50 he while I 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.060
 did not have the accessories top and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.770
 with a shotgun thing he is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.850
 difficult because in this game nor rifle 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.610
 pump are quite difficult to use 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.090
 to some certain elite rebates the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.670
 like this one is the 19 jammer tag that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.050
 are pretty good or even good or 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.510
 minus my two favorite shotgun and 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.910
 said that I could use during this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.310
 this hunt for masters fausto parma 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.530
 is appreciated by the fencing master 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.360
 so here it is after it's really 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.340
 question preferably a question of 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.900
 disbursements how do you play it you know 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.459
 not if you come to the contrary if you 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.720
 aim on the contrary all the time or if 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.269
 you miss to be hot necessarily you 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.180
 Rather, aim with 15 hours 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.799
 head a laser finder the head a year so 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.930
 it's really a question of the water of 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.160
 preference on this class but that's it 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.070
 so at the moment I'm doing this video 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.510
 it's always the moment when new I have 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.489
 not my pc cd video that I was at 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.860
 advance so target this video do you 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.260
 said not yet that that's it he had his 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.510
 pc of springs and that's i'm going 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.600
 to be able to make my videos again 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.239
 every day not at all I 'm going to 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.310
 do well good shit to be 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.910
 So take it and I can not wait and can not wait 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.220
 let him come back 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.170
 they look forward to going fast and 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.430
 come back even faster but so 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.459
 here I would do you have a video ad 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.370
 for to announce you exactly when 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.170
 will my envy my pc be of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.340
 back to make the video no because the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.820
 very special video for that like 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.930
 usual and lasar jeans no but you 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.269
 will have videos that you sing 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.799
 prepare drop opening and that 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.750
 know I really prepare you what 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.180
 I have on hand because otherwise 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.680
 I really did not have much under the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.690
 hand in any case more is planned a few 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.140
 stuff for this week 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.150
 a bit of a missing who will get there 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.000
 you see the proof you are 150 and a half 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.320
 hundred at all and bottom right a choice 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.570
 you change weapons or and that's 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.580
 to see who wrote bulldogs press 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.920
 amr he wrote piecemeal and not 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.470
 so customize so that's for those 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.730
 who would doubt my class if I had 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.010
 really no trumps not the accessory 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.650
 so so here you see as even 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.690
 without accessories the range and the damage 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.400
 are pretty good in general 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.320
 so imagine with a little fright 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.990
 before it's a big cape garden 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.570
 you really have enough to pull 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.790
 enough to heat up even more 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.770
 far from killing even faster so 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.640
 so here it is and I cut also not 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.440
 a lot of little moments because there 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.270
 had uninteresting movements of 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.770
 times when I will die a lot of times 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.240
 because there the time I put a tower 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.040
 and relies on the east it's huge 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.960
 the times when I die because 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.600
 precisely I am detectable this weapon 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.830
 I did not want to mess you up 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.180
 a gameplay of 10 minutes or sometimes 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.110
 for 30 seconds knuckle gesture and 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.340
 maryse and a point 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.540
 so that's why there are small 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.730
 cuts but I hope you get up in a hurry 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.230
 still the best part of the 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.300
 gameplay the wachau objects take a 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.070
 quail 5 but anyways I'm not going 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.620
 hold it for a long time the quail of saints 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.960
 so here I left you anyway 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.850
 the last minute of the gameplay with the 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.040
 last strategic plan because it's okay 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.690
 to be a good part that a good end one 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.550
 will finish on a good end this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.830
 gameplay with halo wars burns that goes 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.390
 also do a lot of damage 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.919
 even steal small as that of 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.750
 beginning so in any case I hope to see 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.710
 if there is this video again we 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.720
 is not put the little blue thumb 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.420
 as usual it helps a lot and 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.310
 especially right now 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.440
 I would like to see you 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.900
 are present a moment where I can 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.820
 to be a little more absent so as 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.470
 usually commented if you have any 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.070
 questions and so we get together 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.070
 very soon and not been good 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.879
 strategy
