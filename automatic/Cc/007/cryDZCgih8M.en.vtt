star you mentioned the reference points

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.799 
star you mentioned the reference points
how<00:00:58.640> does<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:58.909> compare<00:00:59.089> to<00:00:59.360> some<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.720> the

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
how does that compare to some of the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.240 
how does that compare to some of the
other<00:00:59.839> circuits<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.409> you've<00:01:00.589> been<00:01:00.769> on<00:01:00.949> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
other circuits that you've been on and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.460 
other circuits that you've been on and
also<00:01:01.550> how<00:01:02.059> does<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.390> runoff<00:01:02.690> area<00:01:03.050> compared

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
also how does the runoff area compared

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.229 
also how does the runoff area compared
particularly<00:01:04.339> going<00:01:04.610> into<00:01:04.790> turn<00:01:04.940> one

you've run either motogp wise or am a
wise<00:01:09.200> well<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.100> mean<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.390> reference<00:01:11.810> points

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
wise well I mean the reference points

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.169 
wise well I mean the reference points
are<00:01:12.320> just<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.190> know<00:01:13.310> certain<00:01:13.729> parts<00:01:14.030> where

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
are just you know certain parts where

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.550 
are just you know certain parts where
we're<00:01:14.330> coming<00:01:14.450> out<00:01:14.690> of<00:01:14.750> some<00:01:14.990> corners<00:01:15.380> they

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
we're coming out of some corners they

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.919 
we're coming out of some corners they
waited<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.310> put<00:01:16.520> stuff<00:01:16.759> down<00:01:17.000> just<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.600> get

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
waited to put stuff down just to get

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.870 
waited to put stuff down just to get
some<00:01:18.200> feedback<00:01:18.410> on<00:01:18.679> knowing<00:01:19.429> where<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.610> needs

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
some feedback on knowing where it needs

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.190 
some feedback on knowing where it needs
to<00:01:20.030> be<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.360> now<00:01:20.509> they<00:01:20.660> know<00:01:20.810> where<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.050> needs

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
to be and now they know where it needs

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.310 
to be and now they know where it needs
to<00:01:21.289> be<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.590> it'll<00:01:21.830> be<00:01:22.420> fixed<00:01:23.420> pretty<00:01:23.990> much<00:01:24.170> as

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
to be and it'll be fixed pretty much as

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.719 
to be and it'll be fixed pretty much as
soon<00:01:24.350> as<00:01:24.619> possible<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.190> definitely<00:01:25.580> before

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
soon as possible and definitely before

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.359 
soon as possible and definitely before
we<00:01:25.940> get<00:01:26.030> back<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.800> honestly<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.979> runoff

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
we get back and and honestly the runoff

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.510 
we get back and and honestly the runoff
I<00:01:28.759> don't<00:01:28.970> really<00:01:29.119> see<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.740> know<00:01:30.860> every<00:01:31.130> areas

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
I don't really see you know every areas

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.749 
I don't really see you know every areas
is<00:01:31.850> fun<00:01:32.479> for<00:01:32.780> me<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.679> last<00:01:33.830> corners<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.640> know

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
is fun for me the last corners you know

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.990 
is fun for me the last corners you know
the<00:01:34.880> wall<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.240> pretty<00:01:35.750> close<00:01:36.050> but<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:37.429> know<00:01:37.580> I

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
the wall is pretty close but you know I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.080 
the wall is pretty close but you know I
can<00:01:38.630> deal<00:01:38.780> with<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.190> first<00:01:40.850> turn

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
can deal with it and the first turn

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.760 
can deal with it and the first turn
there's<00:01:41.390> plenty<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.720> runoff<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.289> only<00:01:42.530> thing

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
there's plenty of runoff the only thing

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.100 
there's plenty of runoff the only thing
that<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.039> think<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.569> maybe<00:01:44.569> he's<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> little<00:01:44.869> bit

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
that I think it maybe he's a little bit

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.839 
that I think it maybe he's a little bit
different<00:01:45.440> for<00:01:45.649> some<00:01:46.099> of<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.280> european<00:01:46.670> guys

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
different for some of the european guys

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.760 
different for some of the european guys
are<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:47.179> being<00:01:47.360> up<00:01:47.539> next<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:47.929> wall<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.470> mean

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
are just being up next to a wall I mean

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.930 
are just being up next to a wall I mean
just<00:01:48.800> going<00:01:49.280> down<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.429> front<00:01:49.640> straightaway

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
just going down the front straightaway

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.270 
just going down the front straightaway
and<00:01:50.330> real<00:01:50.840> realistically<00:01:51.679> if<00:01:51.950> you're<00:01:52.130> gonna

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and real realistically if you're gonna

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.740 
and real realistically if you're gonna
only<00:01:52.880> way<00:01:53.000> you're<00:01:53.119> going<00:01:53.209> to<00:01:53.270> get<00:01:53.450> into<00:01:53.690> that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
only way you're going to get into that

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.979 
only way you're going to get into that
is<00:01:54.050> if<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.709> mechanical<00:01:55.420> as<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.750> tire

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
is if you have a mechanical as in a tire

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:59.139 
is if you have a mechanical as in a tire
or<00:01:57.020> bike<00:01:57.560> or<00:01:57.800> something<00:01:58.009> or<00:01:58.459> you<00:01:58.640> get<00:01:58.849> hooked

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
or bike or something or you get hooked

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.969 
or bike or something or you get hooked
up<00:01:59.390> with<00:01:59.599> somebody<00:01:59.810> something<00:02:00.470> like<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.770> but

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
up with somebody something like that but

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.979 
up with somebody something like that but
actually<00:02:01.520> in<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.819> corner<00:02:02.179> if<00:02:02.660> you're<00:02:02.840> by

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
actually in the corner if you're by

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.960 
actually in the corner if you're by
yourself<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.739> would<00:02:04.039> say<00:02:04.220> it's<00:02:04.340> impossible<00:02:04.640> to

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
yourself I would say it's impossible to

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.580 
yourself I would say it's impossible to
get<00:02:05.209> into<00:02:05.360> anything<00:02:05.660> just<00:02:06.050> because<00:02:06.140> when<00:02:06.440> you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
get into anything just because when you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.580 
get into anything just because when you
start<00:02:07.489> to<00:02:07.640> turn<00:02:07.819> there's<00:02:08.780> huge<00:02:09.200> run<00:02:09.440> off

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
start to turn there's huge run off

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.380 
start to turn there's huge run off
there's<00:02:09.830> grass<00:02:10.069> everywhere<00:02:10.489> but<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.120> front

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
there's grass everywhere but the front

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.790 
there's grass everywhere but the front
straightaway<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.840> you're<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.290> between<00:02:12.620> two

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
straightaway I you're in between two

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.190 
straightaway I you're in between two
walls<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.150> know<00:02:14.270> with<00:02:14.480> with<00:02:14.840> how

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
walls but you know with with how

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720 
walls but you know with with how
everything<00:02:15.349> is<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.099> bikes<00:02:16.310> usually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
everything is with the bikes usually

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.400 
everything is with the bikes usually

the<00:02:32.269> runoff<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.840> last<00:02:33.200> turn<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.400> to

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
the runoff in the last turn going on to

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.839 
the runoff in the last turn going on to
the<00:02:34.610> front<00:02:34.849> straight<00:02:36.250> yeah<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.340> know<00:02:37.610> there's

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
the front straight yeah you know there's

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.809 
the front straight yeah you know there's
a<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.019> little<00:02:39.260> bit<00:02:39.379> close<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.550> think

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
a it's a little bit close but I think

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.360 
a it's a little bit close but I think
there's

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
there's

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.460 
there's
there's<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> couple<00:02:42.970> little<00:02:43.180> ideas<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.260> might

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
there's a couple little ideas that might

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.440 
there's a couple little ideas that might
might<00:02:45.010> change<00:02:45.340> for<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.760> when<00:02:46.180> we're<00:02:46.330> back

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
might change for that when we're back

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.539 
might change for that when we're back
here<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:49.209> know<00:02:49.330> it's<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:50.650> definitely<00:02:51.129> if

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
here you know it's that's definitely if

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.850 
here you know it's that's definitely if
there<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.659> worst<00:02:53.200> part<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> track

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
there is the worst part on the track

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.190 
there is the worst part on the track
that's<00:02:54.129> where<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.610> but<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.900> know<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.049> think

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
that's where it is but you know I think

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.410 
that's where it is but you know I think
it's<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> be<00:02:56.799> fun<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.099> think<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.879> think

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
it's going to be fun I think I think

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.860 
it's going to be fun I think I think
everybody<00:02:58.840> be<00:02:59.049> able<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.260> deal<00:02:59.440> with<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.799> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
everybody be able to deal with it and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.350 
everybody be able to deal with it and
you<00:03:01.870> know<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.140> only<00:03:02.459> only<00:03:03.459> real<00:03:03.760> reason<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:04.180> see

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
you know the only only real reason I see

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.930 
you know the only only real reason I see
it<00:03:04.450> getting<00:03:04.690> any<00:03:04.870> worse<00:03:05.260> as<00:03:05.560> if<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.310> if

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
it getting any worse as if it's in if

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.350 
it getting any worse as if it's in if
it's<00:03:07.150> raining<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:09.250> when<00:03:09.909> I<00:03:09.940> said<00:03:10.209> there

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
it's raining but when I said there

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360 
it's raining but when I said there
there's<00:03:10.599> a<00:03:10.659> couple<00:03:10.870> ideas<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.829> we've<00:03:12.010> talked

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
there's a couple ideas that we've talked

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.869 
there's a couple ideas that we've talked
about<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.810> suggested<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.680> might<00:03:15.489> make<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
about and I suggested and might make the

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.460 
about and I suggested and might make the
speeds<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.329> little<00:03:16.359> bit<00:03:16.780> quicker<00:03:16.959> on<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.260> front

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
speeds a little bit quicker on the front

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.140 
speeds a little bit quicker on the front
straightaway<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.250> angle<00:03:18.579> of<00:03:18.700> coming<00:03:19.030> on

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
straightaway but the angle of coming on

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.000 
straightaway but the angle of coming on
the<00:03:19.329> front<00:03:19.870> straightaway<00:03:20.079> will<00:03:20.650> be<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.829> whole

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
the front straightaway will be a whole

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.569 
the front straightaway will be a whole
lot<00:03:21.040> nicer<00:03:21.519> for<00:03:22.510> sure<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.340> kind<00:03:24.459> of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
lot nicer for sure so we just kind of

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.369 
lot nicer for sure so we just kind of
got<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.879> decide<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.359> know<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:25.629> they<00:03:25.840> they<00:03:26.200> want

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
got to decide you know if they they want

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.599 
got to decide you know if they they want
to<00:03:26.440> keep<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> speeds<00:03:26.950> down<00:03:27.099> we<00:03:27.280> gotta<00:03:27.430> stay

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
to keep the speeds down we gotta stay

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.160 
to keep the speeds down we gotta stay
where<00:03:27.819> we're<00:03:27.940> at<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.269> it's<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.510> little<00:03:28.780> bit<00:03:28.930> you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
where we're at and it's a little bit you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.869 
where we're at and it's a little bit you
know<00:03:29.200> fighting<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> subject<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> closed

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
know fighting the subject of a closed

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.630 
know fighting the subject of a closed
wall<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.420> then<00:03:31.540> if<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:32.470> they<00:03:32.950> want<00:03:33.159> to<00:03:33.190> get<00:03:33.340> you

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
wall and then if if they want to get you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.390 
wall and then if if they want to get you
know<00:03:33.670> do<00:03:34.269> away<00:03:34.480> with<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.530> being<00:03:36.010> close<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
know do away with the being close to the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.830 
know do away with the being close to the
wall<00:03:36.609> then<00:03:36.819> it's<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.060> going<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.359> a<00:03:37.450> faster

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
wall then it's just going to be a faster

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.170 
wall then it's just going to be a faster
run<00:03:38.019> on<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.260> front<00:03:38.440> straightaway<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:38.980> it's<00:03:39.879> a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
run on the front straightaway so it's a

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.550 
run on the front straightaway so it's a
you<00:03:40.690> know<00:03:40.780> kind<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.049> in<00:03:41.140> between<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.470> couple

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
you know kind of in between a couple

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.410 
you know kind of in between a couple
areas<00:03:41.950> but<00:03:42.250> there's<00:03:42.459> definitely<00:03:42.640> some<00:03:43.090> some

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
areas but there's definitely some some

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.880 
areas but there's definitely some some
things<00:03:43.629> that<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.049> done<00:03:44.170> before<00:03:44.530> we<00:03:44.709> get

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
things that can be done before we get

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.780 
things that can be done before we get
back<00:03:45.040> here<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:46.380> understand<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:47.470> dumb<00:03:47.919> the<00:03:48.579> way

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
back here I understand that dumb the way

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.089 
back here I understand that dumb the way
that<00:03:49.000> turn<00:03:49.329> is<00:03:49.480> laid<00:03:49.989> out<00:03:50.019> now<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.500> curving<00:03:50.950> is

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
that turn is laid out now the curving is

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.490 
that turn is laid out now the curving is
just<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.519> piece<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.120> flexible<00:03:52.630> astroturfing<00:03:53.319> so

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
just a piece of flexible astroturfing so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.750 
just a piece of flexible astroturfing so
that<00:03:53.650> could<00:03:53.799> be<00:03:53.829> moved<00:03:54.010> pretty<00:03:54.250> simply<00:03:54.700> is

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
that could be moved pretty simply is

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.940 
that could be moved pretty simply is
that<00:03:54.940> what<00:03:55.060> they're<00:03:55.150> talking<00:03:55.510> about<00:03:55.799> yeah<00:03:56.799> I'm

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
that what they're talking about yeah I'm

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.800 
that what they're talking about yeah I'm
sure<00:03:57.190> they'll<00:03:57.340> put<00:03:57.579> astroturf<00:03:58.239> or<00:03:58.450> something

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
sure they'll put astroturf or something

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.449 
sure they'll put astroturf or something
and<00:03:58.930> inside<00:03:59.319> right<00:03:59.500> now<00:03:59.530> it's<00:03:59.829> kind<00:03:59.889> of<00:04:00.129> just<00:04:00.250> a

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
and inside right now it's kind of just a

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.210 
and inside right now it's kind of just a
false<00:04:01.269> curb<00:04:01.629> and<00:04:02.169> you<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.680> get<00:04:02.919> your<00:04:03.099> knee

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
false curb and you can get your knee

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.640 
false curb and you can get your knee
into<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.639> pretty<00:04:03.819> good<00:04:04.090> but<00:04:04.359> it's<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.840> you

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
into it pretty good but it's just you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.319 
into it pretty good but it's just you
know<00:04:05.680> subject<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.370> change<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:06.879> that's<00:04:07.060> that's

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
know subject to change and that's that's

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.210 
know subject to change and that's that's
why<00:04:07.599> it<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.959> way<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.169> is<00:04:08.290> but<00:04:08.560> once

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
why it is the way it is but once

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.740 
why it is the way it is but once
everything's<00:04:09.639> laid<00:04:09.879> out<00:04:10.090> by<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.299> time<00:04:10.540> we<00:04:10.660> get

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
everything's laid out by the time we get

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
that wasn't that wasn't a cute time I

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.010 
that wasn't that wasn't a cute time I
mean<00:06:12.520> these<00:06:12.669> these<00:06:13.000> tires<00:06:13.330> are<00:06:13.570> pretty<00:06:13.810> good

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
mean these these tires are pretty good

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.140 
mean these these tires are pretty good
and<00:06:14.230> with<00:06:14.830> any<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.160> these<00:06:15.280> race<00:06:15.520> tires<00:06:15.820> you

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
and with any of these race tires you

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.909 
and with any of these race tires you
could<00:06:16.330> throw<00:06:16.600> them<00:06:16.750> on<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.080> go<00:06:17.470> you<00:06:17.830> know

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
could throw them on and go you know

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.560 
could throw them on and go you know
throw<00:06:18.130> down<00:06:18.280> a<00:06:18.310> 42<00:06:18.850> if<00:06:18.970> you<00:06:19.090> wanted<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.540> but

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
throw down a 42 if you wanted to but

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.840 
throw down a 42 if you wanted to but
it's<00:06:20.440> not<00:06:20.680> too<00:06:20.890> good<00:06:21.100> if<00:06:21.250> you're<00:06:21.400> trying<00:06:21.640> to<00:06:21.730> do

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
it's not too good if you're trying to do

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.430 
it's not too good if you're trying to do
a<00:06:21.880> race<00:06:22.120> tent<00:06:22.419> and<00:06:22.540> actually<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:23.140> know<00:06:23.260> be

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
a race tent and actually you know be

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.780 
a race tent and actually you know be
good<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.860> tire<00:06:24.070> and<00:06:24.220> see<00:06:24.340> what<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:24.550> can<00:06:24.640> do

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
good to the tire and see what it can do

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.600 
good to the tire and see what it can do
in<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:24.940> end<00:06:25.090> so<00:06:25.450> we<00:06:26.140> we<00:06:26.890> did<00:06:27.070> that<00:06:27.250> in<00:06:27.370> the<00:06:27.400> last

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
in the end so we we did that in the last

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.700 
in the end so we we did that in the last
couple<00:06:27.850> laps<00:06:28.120> we<00:06:28.270> got<00:06:28.419> back<00:06:28.570> in<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.750> 43<00:06:29.290> s<00:06:29.440> and

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
couple laps we got back in the 43 s and

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.550 
couple laps we got back in the 43 s and
it<00:06:30.520> was<00:06:30.640> good<00:06:30.820> but<00:06:31.120> you<00:06:31.450> know<00:06:31.570> if<00:06:31.660> we<00:06:31.870> also<00:06:32.200> if

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
it was good but you know if we also if

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.350 
it was good but you know if we also if
we<00:06:32.680> would<00:06:32.860> had<00:06:33.010> a<00:06:33.040> little<00:06:33.280> stiffer<00:06:33.820> front<00:06:34.180> tire

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
we would had a little stiffer front tire

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.310 
we would had a little stiffer front tire
on<00:06:34.540> there<00:06:34.660> would<00:06:34.840> have<00:06:34.930> been<00:06:34.990> quicker

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
on there would have been quicker

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.590 
on there would have been quicker
throughout<00:06:35.830> the<00:06:36.070> whole<00:06:36.220> run<00:06:36.400> but<00:06:36.760> you<00:06:37.360> notice

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
throughout the whole run but you notice

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.450 
throughout the whole run but you notice
that<00:06:37.810> was<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.350> run<00:06:38.530> was<00:06:38.740> just<00:06:39.010> to<00:06:39.130> check<00:06:39.310> the

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
that was the run was just to check the

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.370 
that was the run was just to check the
retire<00:06:39.820> and<00:06:40.000> see<00:06:40.120> how<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.300> was<00:06:40.480> and<00:06:40.780> abrasion

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
retire and see how it was and abrasion

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.690 
retire and see how it was and abrasion
levels<00:06:41.680> and<00:06:41.830> all<00:06:41.919> that<00:06:42.070> stuff<00:06:42.190> and<00:06:42.490> everything

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
levels and all that stuff and everything

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.700 
levels and all that stuff and everything
was<00:06:42.940> pretty<00:06:43.090> good<00:06:44.760> then<00:06:45.760> what<00:06:46.120> does<00:06:46.270> this

first race i was supposed to have was
was<00:06:56.530> in<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:56.710> states<00:06:57.040> and<00:06:57.370> they<00:06:57.580> were<00:06:57.700> both

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
was in the states and they were both

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.610 
was in the states and they were both
going<00:06:58.180> to<00:06:58.240> be<00:06:58.300> in<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.570> states<00:06:58.840> and<00:06:59.169> that<00:06:59.470> would

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
going to be in the states and that would

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.950 
going to be in the states and that would
have<00:06:59.650> been<00:06:59.740> you<00:07:00.100> know<00:07:00.190> really<00:07:00.400> cool<00:07:00.700> but<00:07:00.970> then

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
have been you know really cool but then

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.779 
have been you know really cool but then
we<00:07:02.080> went<00:07:02.200> to<00:07:02.320> donington<00:07:02.890> and<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.490> had<00:07:03.760> our

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 
we went to donington and and had our

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.219 
we went to donington and and had our
first<00:07:04.150> race<00:07:04.330> there<00:07:04.570> and<00:07:04.690> i<00:07:04.720> think<00:07:04.960> it<00:07:05.080> was

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
first race there and i think it was

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.020 
first race there and i think it was
better<00:07:05.500> to<00:07:05.650> do<00:07:06.010> that<00:07:06.190> because<00:07:06.400> now<00:07:06.700> I've<00:07:06.880> been

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
better to do that because now I've been

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.460 
better to do that because now I've been
on<00:07:07.150> the<00:07:07.270> track<00:07:07.479> with<00:07:07.630> those<00:07:07.780> guys<00:07:07.960> I've<00:07:08.260> done<00:07:08.440> a

the<00:07:09.550> start<00:07:09.850> I've<00:07:10.150> done<00:07:10.330> everything<00:07:10.600> and<00:07:10.990> I

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
the start I've done everything and I

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.320

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.760 
won't be nervous at Laguna even if
Lagoona<00:07:13.690> would<00:07:14.020> for<00:07:14.200> sure<00:07:14.230> be<00:07:14.380> a<00:07:14.590> better

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
Lagoona would for sure be a better

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.000 
Lagoona would for sure be a better
result<00:07:15.190> in<00:07:15.340> donington<00:07:16.230> the<00:07:17.230> nerves<00:07:17.500> would<00:07:17.860> be

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
result in donington the nerves would be

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.930 
result in donington the nerves would be
there<00:07:18.310> and<00:07:18.580> all<00:07:18.910> the<00:07:18.970> for<00:07:19.570> the<00:07:19.630> first<00:07:19.840> time<00:07:20.940> rod

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
would would definitely be there and we

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.230 
would would definitely be there and we
got<00:07:23.830> that<00:07:24.010> out<00:07:24.160> of<00:07:24.190> the<00:07:24.280> way<00:07:24.340> at<00:07:24.550> donington<00:07:25.060> so
