this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.309> system<00:00:11.639> Sally<00:00:11.969> hey<00:00:12.389> Sally<00:00:12.660> its<00:00:12.929> dude

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this is system Sally hey Sally its dude

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.010 
this is system Sally hey Sally its dude
dude<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> okay<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.210> sounds<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:15.900> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
dude are you okay you sounds out of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.660 
dude are you okay you sounds out of
breath<00:00:16.230> well<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.920> started<00:00:17.160> growing<00:00:17.490> some

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
breath well I started growing some

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.370 
breath well I started growing some
bacterial<00:00:18.150> cells<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.630> Izzie<00:00:18.900> last<00:00:19.109> night

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
bacterial cells with Izzie last night

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050 
bacterial cells with Izzie last night
and<00:00:19.560> today<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.920> had<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> practice<00:00:20.640> but

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and today I had to get to practice but

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.580 
and today I had to get to practice but
coach<00:00:21.270> kept<00:00:21.570> us<00:00:21.689> late<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> now<00:00:22.170> I'm<00:00:22.289> worried

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
coach kept us late and now I'm worried

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.370 
coach kept us late and now I'm worried
that<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.890> cells<00:00:23.300> dude<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.660> still<00:00:24.900> there

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that the cells dude you still there

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
that the cells dude you still there
this<00:00:25.830> cells<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.689> well<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> guess<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.080> don't

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this cells what well I guess I don't

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.370 
this cells what well I guess I don't
really<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.279> he<00:00:29.490> said<00:00:29.720> dogface<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
really know is he said dogface but that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740 
really know is he said dogface but that
seems<00:00:31.650> wrong<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.550> he<00:00:32.730> probably<00:00:32.969> said<00:00:33.450> log

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
seems wrong is he probably said log

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
seems wrong is he probably said log
phase<00:00:34.110> which<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> cells<00:00:35.399> are

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
phase which is when the cells are

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.760 
phase which is when the cells are
actively<00:00:36.090> growing<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.870> dividing<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.590> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
actively growing and dividing if you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.889 
actively growing and dividing if you
have<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.190> bacteria<00:00:38.700> growing<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.360> happy<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
have some bacteria growing I'm happy to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
have some bacteria growing I'm happy to
put<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.079> cultures<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.739> ice<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.370> will<00:00:41.579> slow

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
put the cultures on ice that will slow

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
put the cultures on ice that will slow
down<00:00:41.850> their<00:00:42.239> growth<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> measure

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
down their growth and you can measure

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
down their growth and you can measure
their<00:00:43.649> density<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> get<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.879> thanks

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
their density when you get here thanks

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
their density when you get here thanks
Sally<00:00:45.840> last<00:00:46.200> night<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:46.710> two<00:00:46.860> flasks<00:00:47.340> at

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
Sally last night we put two flasks at

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.709 
Sally last night we put two flasks at
room<00:00:47.700> temperature<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
room temperature and two in the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.080 
room temperature and two in the
37-degree<00:00:49.289> incubator<00:00:50.070> I'll<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:51.000> as

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
37-degree incubator I'll be there as

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.569 
37-degree incubator I'll be there as
fast<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.510> can

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.119 

hi<00:00:56.420> Sally<00:00:56.749> have<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:57.140> seen<00:00:57.350> dude<00:00:57.530> he<00:00:57.829> just

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
hi Sally have you seen dude he just

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.799 
hi Sally have you seen dude he just
called<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.460> say<00:00:58.609> he's<00:00:58.789> on<00:00:58.940> his<00:00:59.030> way<00:00:59.089> I'm

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
called to say he's on his way I'm

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.630 
called to say he's on his way I'm
putting<00:01:00.199> these<00:01:00.289> cultures<00:01:00.769> on<00:01:00.890> ice<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:01.429> look

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
putting these cultures on ice but look

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.130 
putting these cultures on ice but look
the<00:01:01.969> ones<00:01:02.179> that<00:01:02.329> were<00:01:02.420> at<00:01:02.510> room<00:01:02.659> temperature

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
the ones that were at room temperature

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.139 
the ones that were at room temperature
don't<00:01:03.440> seem<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.739> have<00:01:03.829> grown<00:01:04.070> much<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:04.610> was<00:01:05.089> a

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
don't seem to have grown much I was a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.999 
don't seem to have grown much I was a
little<00:01:05.449> afraid<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.930> they<00:01:06.320> carry<00:01:06.649> a<00:01:06.770> high

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
little afraid of that they carry a high

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.039 
little afraid of that they carry a high
copy<00:01:07.340> protein<00:01:07.850> generator<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.600> dude<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:08.930> I

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
copy protein generator that dude and I

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.840 
copy protein generator that dude and I
made<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.680> growth<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.220> cells<00:01:10.460> takes<00:01:10.759> a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
made the growth of the cells takes a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.609 
made the growth of the cells takes a
real<00:01:11.030> hit<00:01:11.330> when<00:01:11.540> they<00:01:11.659> carry<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.110> plasmid

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
real hit when they carry this plasmid

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.679 
real hit when they carry this plasmid
we've<00:01:12.950> seemed<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.430> spent<00:01:13.640> 12<00:01:13.789> hours<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:14.479> LAC

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
we've seemed and spent 12 hours in LAC

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.480 
we've seemed and spent 12 hours in LAC
face<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:15.439> take<00:01:15.649> two<00:01:15.860> days<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.340> reach

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
face and then take two days to reach

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.730 
face and then take two days to reach
stationary<00:01:17.090> face<00:01:17.360> without<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.110> plasmid<00:01:18.590> is

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
stationary face without the plasmid is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.800 
stationary face without the plasmid is
more<00:01:18.979> like<00:01:19.130> four<00:01:19.369> hours<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.970> go<00:01:20.119> from<00:01:20.149> Lac<00:01:20.570> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
more like four hours to go from Lac the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.960 
more like four hours to go from Lac the
log<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.289> they're<00:01:21.470> saturated<00:01:22.220> overnight<00:01:22.729> and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
log and they're saturated overnight and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.639 
log and they're saturated overnight and
when<00:01:23.090> did<00:01:23.179> you<00:01:23.299> start<00:01:23.360> these<00:01:23.720> growing<00:01:23.990> about

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
when did you start these growing about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.649 
when did you start these growing about
8:00<00:01:24.890> last<00:01:24.920> night<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:25.610> diluted<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.149> strain<00:01:26.420> 1

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
8:00 last night we diluted the strain 1

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.510 
8:00 last night we diluted the strain 1
to<00:01:26.810> 1000<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:27.560> don't<00:01:27.860> think<00:01:28.039> these<00:01:28.130> have<00:01:28.190> grown

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
to 1000 I don't think these have grown

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.340 
to 1000 I don't think these have grown
much<00:01:28.759> since<00:01:29.090> then<00:01:29.330> but<00:01:29.630> I'll<00:01:29.750> measure<00:01:30.020> their

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
much since then but I'll measure their

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.529 
much since then but I'll measure their
density<00:01:30.799> anyway<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.970> cells<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.390> were

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
density anyway the cells that were

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.690 
density anyway the cells that were
growing<00:01:32.869> at<00:01:32.960> 37<00:01:33.530> degrees<00:01:33.860> look<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.310> little<00:01:34.549> more

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
growing at 37 degrees look a little more

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.399 
growing at 37 degrees look a little more
dense<00:01:34.940> maybe<00:01:35.539> they're<00:01:35.750> doubling<00:01:36.170> at<00:01:36.289> an

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
dense maybe they're doubling at an

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.309 
dense maybe they're doubling at an
almost<00:01:36.619> normal<00:01:36.950> rate<00:01:37.299> yep<00:01:38.299> their<00:01:38.720> density<00:01:39.170> has

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
almost normal rate yep their density has

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.320 
almost normal rate yep their density has
definitely<00:01:39.890> changed<00:01:40.340> since<00:01:40.610> yesterday<00:01:40.819> and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
definitely changed since yesterday and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.419 
definitely changed since yesterday and
if<00:01:41.420> food<00:01:41.690> gets<00:01:41.990> here<00:01:42.110> fast<00:01:42.530> we<00:01:42.860> might<00:01:43.069> be<00:01:43.250> able

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
if food gets here fast we might be able

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.370 
if food gets here fast we might be able
to<00:01:43.670> catch<00:01:43.850> him<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.209> log<00:01:44.390> face<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.899> transform

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
to catch him in a log face and transform

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.260

I've seen happen is for the cells to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.119 
I've seen happen is for the cells to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:01.129 
lose a plasmid if it's making them sick
