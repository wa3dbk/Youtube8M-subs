00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
basically wanted to look like the person

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.020

running<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> would<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.909> go

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
running so how I would do it is just go

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.690 
running so how I would do it is just go
into<00:01:39.210> hardcore<00:01:39.479> free<00:01:39.869> throw<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:41.189> custom

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
into hardcore free throw I in custom

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730 
into hardcore free throw I in custom
games<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.600> hold<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.899> tomahawk<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.470> walk

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
games and just hold it tomahawk and walk

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.149 
games and just hold it tomahawk and walk
forward<00:01:44.070> where<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.729> need<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> go<00:01:45.200> um<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
forward where you need to go um it's the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.280 
forward where you need to go um it's the
cinematic<00:01:47.670> isn't<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:49.079> it's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
cinematic isn't like that at all so it's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
cinematic isn't like that at all so it's
gonna<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> bad<00:01:49.860> example<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.939> all<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
gonna be a bad example but it's all I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
gonna be a bad example but it's all I
have<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:52.140> feel<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.470> going

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
have right now I don't feel like going

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710 
have right now I don't feel like going
on<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> record<00:01:53.130> cinematics<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.939> served<00:01:54.659> with

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
on to record cinematics I served with

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
on to record cinematics I served with
that<00:01:54.899> guys<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.740> yeah<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.549> cinematic

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
that guys but yeah so this cinematic

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
that guys but yeah so this cinematic
obviously<00:01:57.570> isn't<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> look<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> best

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
obviously isn't going to look the best

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
obviously isn't going to look the best
but<00:01:58.950> it'll<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.219> decent<00:01:59.640> enough<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.180> tutorial

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
but it'll be decent enough for tutorial

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.580 
but it'll be decent enough for tutorial
purposes<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.119> effect

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
purposes so how do we do this effect

that so pretty much we want to do is we
want<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.769> go<00:02:42.859> to<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.129> red<00:02:43.340> channel<00:02:43.700> enter<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
want to go to the red channel enter the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.479 
want to go to the red channel enter the
red<00:02:44.510> channel<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.959> levels<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.680> it's<00:02:46.190> make<00:02:46.370> sure

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
red channel of levels and it's make sure

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.660 
red channel of levels and it's make sure
the<00:02:46.670> contrast<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.470> brightness<00:02:48.799> if<00:02:49.370> each

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the contrast and the brightness if each

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.759 
the contrast and the brightness if each
match<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.599> it<00:02:50.810> actually<00:02:50.930> looks<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.379> it<00:02:51.500> does

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
match and it actually looks like it does

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.710 
match and it actually looks like it does
so<00:02:52.700> we're<00:02:52.879> going<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.060> go<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.420> green

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
so we're going to go to the green

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.680 
so we're going to go to the green
channel<00:02:54.109> and<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:55.459> green<00:02:56.000> channel<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.420> this

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
channel and the green channel of this

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.289 
channel and the green channel of this
and<00:02:57.500> make<00:02:57.680> sure<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:58.069> match<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.909> think<00:02:59.629> the<00:03:00.109> arm

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
and make sure this match I think the arm

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.930 
and make sure this match I think the arm
dark<00:03:02.299> seem<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.599> be<00:03:02.690> brought<00:03:02.900> up<00:03:03.170> it's

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.569 
messing up the colors making sure it
matches<00:03:26.379> I'm<00:03:27.379> pretty<00:03:27.739> as<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> proof<00:03:28.280> channel

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
matches I'm pretty as a proof channel

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.400 
matches I'm pretty as a proof channel
about<00:03:29.090> good<00:03:29.359> now<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.599> highlights<00:03:30.019> need<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.319> be

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
about good now the highlights need to be

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.789 
about good now the highlights need to be
a<00:03:30.440> bit<00:03:30.739> down<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> bit<00:03:31.250> star<00:03:31.669> beats<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.200> let's<00:03:33.470> go

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
a bit down a bit star beats so let's go

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.150 
a bit down a bit star beats so let's go
maybe<00:03:34.310> like<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.790> boat<00:03:35.049> here<00:03:36.049> all<00:03:36.889> right<00:03:37.010> that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
maybe like the boat here all right that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.349 
maybe like the boat here all right that
should<00:03:37.190> look<00:03:37.400> nice<00:03:37.609> now<00:03:37.669> let's<00:03:38.030> go<00:03:38.150> back<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
should look nice now let's go back to

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.500 
should look nice now let's go back to
the<00:03:38.870> RGB<00:03:39.349> view<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.799> there<00:03:40.459> we<00:03:40.579> go<00:03:40.760> looks<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.180> lot

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the RGB view and there we go looks a lot

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.650 
the RGB view and there we go looks a lot
nicer<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:42.799> this<00:03:43.129> is<00:03:43.160> before<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.419> after

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
nicer so this is before this is after

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.750 
nicer so this is before this is after
definitely<00:03:45.650> looks<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.859> lot<00:03:46.069> more<00:03:46.129> looking<00:03:46.579> for

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
definitely looks a lot more looking for

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.580 
definitely looks a lot more looking for
actually<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.419> scene<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:51.230> there's<00:03:51.530> a

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
actually in the scene so then there's a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.710 
actually in the scene so then there's a
few<00:03:51.799> things<00:03:51.919> you<00:03:52.129> can<00:03:52.160> do<00:03:52.340> what<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.579> did<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.269> a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
few things you can do what I did is a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.900 
few things you can do what I did is a
pressurized<00:03:54.410> change<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.250> transfer<00:03:55.639> mode<00:03:55.790> of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
pressurized change the transfer mode of

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.650 
pressurized change the transfer mode of
my<00:03:56.030> sniper<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:57.230> overlay<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:59.359> might<00:03:59.569> have

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
my sniper to overlay that might have

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.300 
my sniper to overlay that might have
been<00:03:59.690> at<00:03:59.900> old<00:04:00.139> I've<00:04:00.290> actually<00:04:00.500> really<00:04:01.099> need<00:04:01.250> a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
been at old I've actually really need a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.039 
been at old I've actually really need a
fast<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.900> actually<00:04:03.290> really<00:04:03.650> cool<00:04:04.690> there's<00:04:05.690> a

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
fast it's actually really cool there's a

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.300 
fast it's actually really cool there's a
ton<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.440> stuff<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:06.859> guys<00:04:06.980> can<00:04:07.160> mess<00:04:07.280> around

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
ton of stuff you guys can mess around

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.119 
ton of stuff you guys can mess around
this<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.180> much<00:04:08.299> creativity<00:04:08.709> but<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:09.799> do<00:04:09.980> like

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
this so much creativity but you do like

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.559 
this so much creativity but you do like
that<00:04:10.370> looks<00:04:10.609> cool<00:04:10.819> I'm<00:04:11.060> pretty<00:04:11.299> sure<00:04:11.389> this<00:04:11.480> is

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
that looks cool I'm pretty sure this is

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.600 
that looks cool I'm pretty sure this is
what<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.720> actually<00:04:11.840> use

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
what I actually use

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.130 
what I actually use
in<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.570> DRC<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.700> but<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.269> suggest<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.720> guys<00:04:16.900> do

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
in the DRC but but I suggest you guys do

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.259 
in the DRC but but I suggest you guys do
is<00:04:17.320> don't<00:04:17.950> do<00:04:18.310> what<00:04:18.459> I'm<00:04:18.579> doing<00:04:18.640> just

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
is don't do what I'm doing just

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.750 
is don't do what I'm doing just
basically<00:04:19.630> do<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:20.769> stage<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.340> just

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
basically do this to this stage I just

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.060 
basically do this to this stage I just
mess<00:04:22.000> around<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.390> everything<00:04:22.930> as<00:04:23.110> much<00:04:23.920> as

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
mess around with everything as much as

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.830 
mess around with everything as much as
you<00:04:24.130> can<00:04:24.310> different<00:04:25.030> all<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:25.510> looks<00:04:25.690> really

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
you can different all this looks really

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.690 
you can different all this looks really
nice<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:26.770> produced<00:04:27.070> as<00:04:27.160> much<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.430> can<00:04:27.550> do

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
nice it's produced as much you can do

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.190 
nice it's produced as much you can do
but<00:04:27.910> how<00:04:28.240> much<00:04:28.330> do<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:28.510> got<00:04:28.630> one<00:04:28.810> more<00:04:28.960> cool

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
but how much do you got one more cool

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.570 
but how much do you got one more cool
thing<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.520> on<00:04:30.730> your<00:04:30.760> cinematic<00:04:31.240> want<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.080> add<00:04:32.200> a

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
thing so on your cinematic want to add a

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.790 
thing so on your cinematic want to add a
displacement<00:04:33.580> map<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:35.230> let's<00:04:35.350> just<00:04:35.500> drag<00:04:35.740> that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
displacement map so let's just drag that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.480 
displacement map so let's just drag that
on<00:04:36.190> there<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:38.200> let's<00:04:38.590> set<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.100> displacement

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
on there so let's set the displacement

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.600 
on there so let's set the displacement
map<00:04:39.700> layer<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.510> green<00:04:40.720> screens<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:42.100> set

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
map layer to the green screens and set

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.110 
map layer to the green screens and set
it<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.910> maybe<00:04:43.090> like<00:04:44.640> lightness<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:46.050> then<00:04:47.050> I

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
it to maybe like lightness and then I

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.790 
it to maybe like lightness and then I
don't<00:04:49.120> know<00:04:49.210> luminate<00:04:49.750> some<00:04:50.080> some<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.590> that

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
don't know luminate some some of that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.780 
don't know luminate some some of that
snap<00:04:51.760> if<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:51.940> solo<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:54.460> can<00:04:54.610> actually

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
snap if you solo this you can actually

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.970 
snap if you solo this you can actually
start<00:04:55.090> dragging<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.750> as<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.830> we

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
start dragging this as you can see we

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.360 
start dragging this as you can see we
get<00:04:57.130> this<00:04:57.250> cool<00:04:57.910> morphy<00:04:58.540> effects<00:04:59.040> it's<00:05:00.040> really

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
get this cool morphy effects it's really

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.060 
get this cool morphy effects it's really
really<00:05:00.640> nice<00:05:00.820> so<00:05:01.750> if<00:05:01.810> we<00:05:02.020> want<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.320> offset<00:05:02.680> it

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
really nice so if we want to offset it

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.090 
really nice so if we want to offset it
40<00:05:03.430> pixels<00:05:03.790> let's<00:05:04.419> go<00:05:04.570> 80<00:05:04.930> pixels<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.680> we're

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
40 pixels let's go 80 pixels and we're

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.310 
40 pixels let's go 80 pixels and we're
also<00:05:06.190> going<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.460> need<00:05:06.610> another<00:05:07.320> offsets

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
also going to need another offsets

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.200 
also going to need another offsets
basically<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.250> adjust<00:05:09.610> if<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:09.970> see<00:05:10.090> this

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
basically to adjust if you see this

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.560 
basically to adjust if you see this
black<00:05:10.480> bars<00:05:10.810> on<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.050> outside<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.970> X<00:05:13.360> we

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
black bars on the outside so in the X we

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.740 
black bars on the outside so in the X we
have<00:05:13.690> 80<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.470> figured<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.950> need<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.250> need<00:05:15.430> ed<00:05:16.000> or

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
have 80 so figured I need to need ed or

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.170 
have 80 so figured I need to need ed or
negative<00:05:17.200> 80<00:05:17.290> pixels<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.040> acts<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.820> make

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
negative 80 pixels and the acts to make

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.550 
negative 80 pixels and the acts to make
up<00:05:19.330> for<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.800> whoops<00:05:20.800> does<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:21.760> work<00:05:22.080> maybe<00:05:23.080> plus

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
up for it whoops does it work maybe plus

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.400 
up for it whoops does it work maybe plus
movie<00:05:25.080> not<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.200> didn't<00:05:26.410> work<00:05:26.470> either<00:05:28.410> it's
