00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.200 

how's<00:00:29.320> NASA<00:00:29.739> researching<00:00:30.489> new<00:00:30.610> spacecraft

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
how's NASA researching new spacecraft

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.240 
how's NASA researching new spacecraft
for<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.480> future<00:00:31.869> one<00:00:32.710> way<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.070> through

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
for the future one way is through

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.460 
for the future one way is through
propulsion<00:00:33.820> with<00:00:34.270> a<00:00:34.300> new<00:00:34.510> exploration<00:00:34.900> vision

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
propulsion with a new exploration vision

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.619 
propulsion with a new exploration vision
we<00:00:35.860> will<00:00:35.949> need<00:00:36.100> propulsion<00:00:36.610> systems<00:00:37.000> that

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
we will need propulsion systems that

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.020 
we will need propulsion systems that
will<00:00:37.839> be<00:00:38.080> low-cost<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.949> will<00:00:39.220> enable<00:00:39.430> rapid

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
will be low-cost and will enable rapid

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.860 
will be low-cost and will enable rapid
safe<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.780> reliable<00:00:41.260> access<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:42.250> in<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.449> from

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
safe and reliable access to in and from

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.460

so<00:00:44.680> why<00:00:44.829> don't<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.040> need<00:00:45.220> new<00:00:45.400> propulsion

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
so why don't we need new propulsion

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.939 
so why don't we need new propulsion
systems<00:00:46.420> aren't<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.170> old<00:00:47.290> ones<00:00:47.500> get<00:00:47.680> enough

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
systems aren't the old ones get enough

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.220 
systems aren't the old ones get enough
most<00:00:48.519> us<00:00:48.820> propulsion<00:00:49.360> systems<00:00:49.720> are<00:00:49.870> based<00:00:50.079> on

most us propulsion systems are based on
1950s<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.190> 60s<00:00:51.220> technology<00:00:52.120> they're

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
1950s and 60s technology they're

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.380 
1950s and 60s technology they're
high-risk<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.710> expensive<00:00:54.220> right<00:00:55.000> now<00:00:55.150> it

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
high-risk and expensive right now it

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.380 
high-risk and expensive right now it
costs<00:00:55.799> $10,000<00:00:56.799> per<00:00:57.040> pound<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.820> put<00:00:58.000> payload

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390

space transportation they all sound

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.670 
space transportation they all sound
great<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.330> isn't<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.750> propulsion<00:02:23.290> system

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
great but isn't one propulsion system

great but isn't one propulsion system
better<00:02:23.860> than<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.220> other

well<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.300> are<00:02:25.360> pros<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.720> cons<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.050> each

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
well there are pros and cons to each

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.470 
well there are pros and cons to each
system<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.280> choice<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.670> propulsion<00:02:27.970> system

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
system the choice of propulsion system

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.240 
system the choice of propulsion system
depends<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> energy<00:02:29.650> requirements<00:02:30.130> of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
depends on the energy requirements of

depends on the energy requirements of
the<00:02:30.340> mission<00:02:30.640> its<00:02:31.330> duration<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.900> destination

whether<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.460> is<00:02:33.550> robotic<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.150> human

I<00:02:34.630> can't<00:02:35.110> wait<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.560> travel<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.040> space<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.850> so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
I can't wait to travel to space it's so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.890 
I can't wait to travel to space it's so
exciting

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
exciting

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.960 
exciting
yes<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:38.920> keep<00:02:39.130> studying<00:02:39.520> your<00:02:39.610> math<00:02:39.760> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
yes it is so keep studying your math and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.280 
yes it is so keep studying your math and
science<00:02:40.300> don't<00:02:40.840> worry

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
science don't worry

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.080 
science don't worry
