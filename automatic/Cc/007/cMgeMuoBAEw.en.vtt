00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hi all 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.090
 that's why the writer like being an impression 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.929
 there we got the lic 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:10.329
 you'll need 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.559
 davies personally bought it smaller because it is easier for us to 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.990
 offer details 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.190
 June linoleum lic I worked with my tennis which you can get in stores 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.670
 where they sell materials but their homeland an inking roller a press 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.480
 Recorded 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.390
 but still can also be used with 1 tablespoon for as the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 woodcut 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.080
 putting pressure on inflation but being very careful not to move the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.340
 blank 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.970
 now we can start 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.320
 you need a sketch of what you want to do 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.480
 taking into account the amount of colors I want is that you have 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.160
 image 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 this technique 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.210
 they call themselves pressing the class lost so keep in mind kees are going to be 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.290
 one of your injuries or more since you will not be able to repeat the process if you want 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.030
 You can take an enlarged photocopy produced the tube sector 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 to be able to adjust so much silver jersey 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.060
 It also serves to make modifications on ccm without damaging the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.050
 original 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.490
 you must also elaborate 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.500
 which consists of a little the thick preferably pressed cardboard or 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.090
 straw cardboard 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.630
 double the size of your image more or less or the size of paper in the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.370
 which we print the image 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.590
 the bridge to cut a part that equaled that of your clark 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.870
 the space must have the same size as the silver 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.840
 the goal of this year is that the iron does not move in addition to power 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.510
 undertake in an accurate manner 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.610
 several times is causing the images to tie min 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.680
 now he understands the plate with the base color in that it should be the lightest color 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.210
 I could also remove some parts at this time to leave some 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.670
 whites 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.770
 public your drawing on the plate 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.070
 claim that the leaders of the outlines were surprise 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.039
 these will be on the plate and then repeat the ones with which it is read 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.070
 start to remove everything that is within the limits 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.070
 to these areas not inside the tape when the client 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.570
 that is, those who are on paper will keep with hairpins 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.760
 you must bear in mind that the image you work in this sense 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.990
 since the first set is like a stamp that was printed in trouble 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.240
 in my case the image is looking to the left 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699
 every two games in azcapotzalco I answer 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:35.469
 I worked a few colors at home to make it easier to explain 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.669
 you continue with your process we will have to be more determinant 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.919
 could use only one color if you liked my video comment subscribe to me 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.689
 channel 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.229
 if you have material on experimental techniques other central 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.269
 since that day 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.269
 if you will leave me address to be able to do it 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.099
 you have to be an idiot to do
