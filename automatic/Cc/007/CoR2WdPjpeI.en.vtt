00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.149
 well now I'm going to show you how to order 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.120
 numbers 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.349
 with formulas 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.769
 As we know this we can do it quickly using the function 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.609
 behind 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.970
 but podolski for some reason the quotes that this is being made of 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.989
 way 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.569
 dynamic 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:23.999
 for example if you have 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.999
 the table the sales 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.769
 on the other a cumulative and if you want it dynamically you are 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 giving 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 the order 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.150
 franc of major 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.570
 a minor cook and kiss 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.790
 I think it's in this case you can accuse 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.270
 some functions and that's what we're going to see 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.270
 now that we're going to put newbies here that are going to be changing 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.260
 dynamically so you can see how they work 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.670
 clark formulas 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.940
 to contribute nothing let's put 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 opposed a fusion that espabile actor and punctually 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.880
 Lets put 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.460
 white t 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.440
 of 14 thousand 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 ap ricky in bills 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.270
 both control enter 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 and here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.659
 we are as expressed in both axes 9 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.400
 - How it changes 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.770
 or if we do any other 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.090
 movements 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 and here 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.900
 that is not happening with this function is max dyn 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.040
 reveal the maximum number 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.300
 and the wine 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 What we have is that never an order 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.270
 p 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.630
 for example 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.630
 in this case the order tightened greater 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.330
 for this we are going to use I do not know a function that loves 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.600
 the simo 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.790
 mateos what attends functions 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.940
 percent e 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.240
 Charles 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.260
 for him maximum value 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.620
 for example the second 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.990
 higher 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.319
 or the third the fourth as like three others 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.709
 but let's indicate 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.289
 here in the syntax it tells us is 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.259
 this matrix 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.519
 and here we indicate what is 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.089
 percent 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:21.559
 in the first 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.629
 what 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.599
 or the order you should have 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.359
 within the range of the matrix for example the first second third 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:29.459
 fourth fifth 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.499
 higher do not consist turn using the function 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.959
 It is very old the past when you noticed but now 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.480
 and let's put here would be the matrix 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.549
 the san martÃ­n c 4 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.429
 this is for 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.289
 keep a difference 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.089
 absolute and here we can put 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.869
 frank number one 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.849
 salaries 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.059
 what do we want? 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.059
 according to the quantity 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.719
 in huesca let's see 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.259
 registered here in this case are 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.189
 ettien figures 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.439
 or we can also use a cell reference 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.229
 as well 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.299
 and here this would be the organ we have here is from the maximum 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.130
 20 thousand 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.419
 90 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.309
 here we have it we have it in the first place 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.899
 and the 14 thousand 157 is the minimum is in the last place 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.429
 now this 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.429
 leek instead of using these numbers here 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.499
 we can be 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.499
 a function to not have to wait for this 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.439
 this number button or have that will indicate who 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.769
 the order 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.989
 that's not why we're going to use the rows function 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.799
 and what we are in that city the world the piles 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.830
 of a marriage reference 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.669
 we can indicate for example 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.829
 from the uemoa sides 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.359
 would 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:03.969
 gil ana classes 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.719
 chamosa 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.619
 now 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.129
 leticia from your team 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.129
 it can not be from the same path 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.839
 funds to fund the function 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.179
 i so that you do not go for reference movement we are going to 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.159
 leave 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.829
 the initial reference 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.300
 as absolute then 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.229
 it will always be maintained 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.620
 from here from 1 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.699
 will go 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.909
 in that being like 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.909
 how do we put it? 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.669
 ap omar we trace down step 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.279
 we would like to 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.279
 it's us petrano does not need us 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.279
 we wanted here 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.879
 philip the first place 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.509
 then in this part we should return the fireman 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.779
 to these and masters the g9 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:00.339
 sd that part of the art the formula to the function or is returning 1 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.289
 that mind is what you need 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.529
 which would be in this case 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.349
 the pastrana number 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.139
 and here 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.339
 4 to select 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.580
 we press pg9 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.050
 he says he is not coming back for the moment 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.659
 and in this case at the end 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.449
 should give us 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.870
 the number 10 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.990
 and well we can do this 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.199
 conversely we are also going to copy 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.789
 and paste 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.789
 and here we are going to change 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.389
 talk another function 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.300
 it is time 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.259
 and if we see 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.719
 from her 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.500
 should give us a hundred the order 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.210
 the other way 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.220
 here what he is doing is that not being the 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.699
 first place 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.479
 What is it 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.479
 what is the number 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.889
 the orchestral dtf 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.389
 percent the reverse of this function 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.970
 is god here we have telvent in the first place in extra time in penal and 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.550
 here we have it 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.889
 to the bottom 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.900
 cough this is a way to 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.839
 of computer 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.289
 but there are numerous dry are three numbers nothing more 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.379
 and good the advantage is irrigators we will go to that pressed the g9 they will change 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.099
 all these numbers 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:33.509
 I should change 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.309
 this afternoon 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:38.339
 so you have a table soon you are accumulating sales 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.869
 you have to cover is that the order 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.879
 either in this way loans 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.180
 is this 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.249
 function 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.919
 that would serve more 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.389
 more than using 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.650
 this option of ortega
