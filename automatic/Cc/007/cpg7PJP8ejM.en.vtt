 Cuba will become Germany for the first time 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.860
 broadcast 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.509
 Christmas party at youtube 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.329
 Presenter sitting by her case 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.189
 We have four weeks to go 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.380
 to start the regular season on 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.460
 Weekend tresors with porno holidays 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.859
 give only knows one 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.829
 the vikings are playing alongside steelers and 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.160
 Now four weeks boast before us until on 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.460
 10 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.650
 Let's start with the season kickoff steelers 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.239
 against the beatles i know of 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.339
 addressed four weeks made up to 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.050
 start fight against the 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.550
 time to kill a bit we look 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.909
 again the highlights in the last one 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.820
 super bowl controversially discussed the 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:55.750
 last drive of the xerox and there stone 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.189
 it's still a third 10 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.159
 See forced and wilson with the 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.330
 Safe pass on garics reinforce them 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.049
 of course, I'll show you 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.950
 believe you 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.390
 the cable-free from 12 the time will 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.520
 Of course, continue now at the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.670
 top-ranking the order 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.400
 so four musicians will fall pretty much 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:30.130
 better 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.570
 definitely not what the complete s 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 no, the pensions of the girls talk show 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.130
 is given with the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.690
 the referee forward 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 Let's see what I hope the colleagues 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.570
 player card company logo screaming 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.530
 and of course I would soon 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.440
 unbelievable lack of concentration 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.970
 harting has him even if controversial 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.590
 be read in the last two 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.759
 The referees always have minutes 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.890
 to the right every turn again to 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.420
 stage and again to look at it is 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.880
 now only a pretty is not a cellar 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.830
 no coach to restrict that one 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.870
 everything and even trainings 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.930
 stunned all sides so if the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 zeox shares turning the crash course becomes 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.910
 to enter the history books 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.130
 I also have a super bowl 42 at 2006 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.670
 I believe the sheep were in it 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.989
 principle for the pegnitz at that time against 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.670
 wales and maybe you can too 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.120
 ask at this helm ketch of the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.250
 energy and everything goes in the mind 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.830
 Regardless , sabrina had 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.500
 in a good mood as so often weak and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.930
 flexible in 1 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.710
 So incredible the will be happy to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.160
 Keeping safe is also easy 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.230
 regulate 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640
 you want this is the biggest game of the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.200
 song you just want this one too 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.510
 Ketch make the ball comes to you 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.910
 a hopeless situation must be about yourself 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.160
 outgrow and usually do too 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.590
 Again this is 100 percent concentration 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.959
 He does not look any different than the one on the other 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.630
 ball and in the end it even has that far 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.920
 that he gets up and the distance always 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.920
 and then pushed out completely 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.370
 it is hardly more exciting wide of 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.230
 of course exposed to fear 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.750
 Bigbank did not forget third and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.920
 10 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.390
 hours from kids bloodshed of 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.680
 weak pieces had to do already 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.570
 create 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.300
 but now to play minute so 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.660
 actually, xerox calls for fairy tale forest 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.870
 has to offer 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.340
 hotels.com up to one year long-term 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.610
 continue 57 seconds one year further 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.750
 and that was an issue 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.360
 what are you doing have enough time around 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.830
 to make more than one move 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.239
 certainly it is things 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.010
 of course it is as well 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.120
 always so my go so long that he thinks 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.739
 that brazil 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.860
 maybe you just try something 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.810
 it's just partly different 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.690
 theoretically she can do everything now 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.330
 it is also confusion nights motion 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.050
 and they fit 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.880
 unbelievably incredible 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.110
 miscalculated I can understand it 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.210
 I probably would have done that too 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.830
 but now, of course, all the more tragic as 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.160
 it's yours that's 20 seconds off 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.979
 in front of a school of the game 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.330
 and what do you do or I mean now 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.960
 Realistically, only a dream 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.870
 even if they still can not believe it 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.830
 let's say we selected it play 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.660
 is by piquÃ© and now also like times 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.310
 Products it looks beautiful country and 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.470
 water jumps into learning 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.850
 He recognizes the route he knows very well 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.220
 where the ball should come 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.610
 he would have done straight it is just 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.240
 just in better position too 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.240
 again that would be 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:19.199
 but you can not do it justice 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:30.480
 you also can not believe that this 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:33.660
 thing still lose second enlistment 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.250
 the climate was the penultimate home game 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.890
 like other games in any case mine 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.260
 come at the end awards opinion, 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:48.120
 Who deserves more, I have to go now 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.330
 Nightmares complains about the start of the new one 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.320
 care as a possibility to all good 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.560
 make and history again 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.560
 correct 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.760
