00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.469
 hey people welcome to cupsieger us 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.790
 have been asking so many questions lately 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.460
 get a very specific topic 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.330
 Although asked what can you do against the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.160
 Many suffer from the belly 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.110
 The phenomenon remained bloated 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.320
 belly 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.490
 in the morning at noon in the morning 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.259
 and while eating and so on 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.720
 that will happen then and throughout the day 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.950
 and it's just you have one 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.170
 big belly and he can actually 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 not at all come from the small one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.610
 the quantity one is women the partial 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 that I get pregnant have real 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.910
 so many people wrote to us now and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 That's why I'll give you a few 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.380
 give tips that you have to pay attention to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.630
 So really the basics where 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.790
 probably 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.160
 99 percent of cases resolve directly 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.340
 if you keep that in mind 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.230
 basics that you should therefore be aware you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.860
 has a flat stomach and no him 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.439
 So playboy has that is very important 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 Her ripe fruit is what I would be 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.040
 really say the most important 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.920
 and many do not know what is ripe 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.869
 Fruit means I see it again and again 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.490
 The banana service has few points 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.620
 black which must not be rich 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.300
 it does not have to be rich for a long time yes 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.210
 try your hand at the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.950
 borders there tries to touch that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.340
 you really until just before the year 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.530
 taste go to because the banana at 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.010
 the kg at the mango at the kiwi and so on 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.010
 continue 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.460
 that must be really great and super soft 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.370
 and that is really essential 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.260
 So ripe fruit is the basis and 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.010
 if you really have to, you really have to 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.680
 make consistent you can not 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.869
 in between then the immature was on 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.940
 do you have immature kg and as well 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.010
 Lasters because that works permanently 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.200
 do not live 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.280
 second point very important in between 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.700
 to drink water 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.170
 even in winter and that's easy 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.270
 important for the digestion to work 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.920
 so that the moisture in the liquid 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.540
 system so that if it all works 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.649
 that was for example the one with me 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.720
 main reason why I have a time 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.180
 this instruction was not enough 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.680
 drunk water and that's you 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.720
 can not even drink water and 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.030
 then two hours later his your 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.860
 Bananas or whatever food you eat now 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.269
 I do not get bloody belly you have to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.450
 really over a period of time 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.000
 Eight consistent resounding isaac threesome 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.769
 really over weeks a week regularly 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.049
 to drink regularly several times a day 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.049
 the third most important point is sport 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:42.190
 Sport is so much under the radar for 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.680
 so many people that and I talk 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.840
 really from endurance sports or sports where 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.970
 he whole system of wake-up comes yours 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 whole heart circulation system that you 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.680
 your heart or heartbeat feels and so on 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.819
 continue 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.409
 the whole circulation system must be in 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.859
 come and I really would have 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:03.189
 endurance sports several times a week 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.959
 then go for a walk every five days 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.819
 two kilometers run the next five 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.889
 day and again five days later five 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.540
 Unfortunately, cycling a kilometer is not enough 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.519
 out 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.169
 it is the duty to digest it 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.970
 is still for so many other things too 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.579
 well clear now for the digestive 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.220
 for a bloated stomach it is quite whole 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 Often the people do not even 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.260
 do sports or just a little and it 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.870
 is so synonymous so you recognize that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.190
 you also see all the people either 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.909
 if people are many fruits and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.659
 many fruits 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.129
 because they either do sport or they do 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.319
 fall at some point before why 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.750
 because you can not last that many 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.970
 eat fruits without sport without no 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.769
 Sport and endurance sports are not possible or 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.690
 they do not take much up first , yes 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.709
 because we are not three bananas a day then 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.909
 that probably does not matter 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.590
 I have to make any sport can I 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.319
 also that heike ding do on my account 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.019
 but with fruit is ours anyway 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.199
 Opinion sports is very important 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:04.329
 factor is a very important pillar to 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:05.680
 the fourth point is simply this you 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.250
 You have to try to separate yours 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.769
 eat 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.599
 you must not be cooked and cooked 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.260
 raw mix yes many do that yes 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.900
 these days 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.840
 this red program for example the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.849
 hype in general you can not like that 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.600
 a portion of rice with whatever 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.300
 eat 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.060
 and two hours later the bananas 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 room some on the tricky likes this 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.840
 well tolerated but many tolerate it 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.760
 not and get on this huge 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.460
 belly so trend that and we recommend 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.680
 in the morning until the beginning with raw vegetables 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.970
 and to start fruit 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.180
 as long as you want that as long as you do that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.170
 can and then later in the evening what 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.270
 cooked food 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.910
 Who, for example , a salad in the evening? 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.480
 is there with potatoes or rips or 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.420
 What ever 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.170
 then nothing but not only it 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.420
 The best way to get an appointment is in minutes and minutes 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.940
 then continued with the purchased the 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.100
 is not very important for mixed that 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.140
 do not mix the fruits and vegetables 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.580
 the purchased because the for example the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.650
 Carbohydrates the longer chain in 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.270
 carbohydrates in potatoes and in the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.810
 Rice just take longer 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.860
 digest 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.600
 also longer than it's short-chain 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.080
 I say short chain molecules 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.880
 Carbohydrates from the fruit you 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.690
 now the four points so once 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.870
 in a nutshell , ripe fruit 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.080
 regular drinking sports and just that 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.280
 mix that should be let 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.240
 if you still important things 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.910
 Garbage you forget something now 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.950
 Write to me below write yours 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.720
 experience with a belly belly underneath 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.330
 that will interest us and also 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.230
 others, thank you for seeing and we 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.230
