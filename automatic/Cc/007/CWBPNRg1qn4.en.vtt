00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.259
 dear students i 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.940
 Welcome you to this 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.830
 interesting survey repetitorium 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 the general and special 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.910
 embryology if they understood that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 You can and then you can later 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.800
 all details hang into it and also in the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 further details learn here an overview 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 of the embryo 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859
 Here we see you inside the tube 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.420
 what he is special and nested 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 we know the embryo is made up 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 an external one from a middle one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.080
 messedamm and an inner and today 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 and go out of those three germ layers 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.239
 all different organ systems later 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.239
 out 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
 here we see the embryo or the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.129
 embryonic no disc 2 patrick 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.290
 Nestled in the lower mucosa 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.690
 Here we have the hit plastic ball 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 here we see that amon the amon cave 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 which later becomes a fruitblood and we 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 See that one he said yellow here 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 this is just supposed to be drawn 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.579
 clear inside here in the embryo 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 the hearts are hollowed out here in front 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.600
 that gentleman the two young more expensive 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.980
 cave and they have two thighs 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 which together configure so 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.130
 confluence with the territorial cave 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.210
 So to the abdominal cavity extremist here 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 shown blau.de so the reddish either 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.200
 here yellowish and here we see one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.030
 part of the yolk sack it you too here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 see 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.360
 Here is a transition from the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 international heights shown there come 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 I later on back the emmerich am 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.960
 in the beginning so small that when the intestine itself 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 a part of the intestine is rapidly developing 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.729
 must be shifted to the outside 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.530
 this is called according to the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.509
 physiological scar break because here on 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 nabel because you can see here then just the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 is shifted to the outside and therefore 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 the body cavity is big enough he becomes 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.159
 withdrawn again 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.079
 but we see with the heart cave the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.020
 lungs cave and the abdominal cavity 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.720
 this is to serve as an attunement here 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.579
 again the yolk sack short to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.710
 Development of the first second week of the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.290
 in timetables you actually afterwards 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.729
 but still understands core points anyway 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.130
 what will we become like afterwards 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.189
 proceed systematically in the first 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.079
 week happens what we see here 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.229
 namely, that it comes to fertilization 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.730
 and then to the implantation in the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:20.099
 notorious in the second week 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 then I have a 2-leafed the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.670
 it will be our third week that we will 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 a trifoliate no disc 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.480
 get and then important there 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.790
 between the fourth and eighth week 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 the entire organo genesis takes place 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.569
 so all bodies are created, it is 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 exciting that of course the two 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.560
 organ systems must be there first 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.500
 steer point one and that would be 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.120
 brain and second, of course, the blood 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.409
 I floor the whole body 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.299
 and that would be the heart 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.160
 We have one there but he says so 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.500
 he does not have that over the birds 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.970
 function of a diet and therefore 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.220
 I need a very early one 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.750
 circulatory system and of course a pump 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.060
 the heart is on the circulatory system 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.660
 point therefore I always say hhl and 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.180
 heart are very early and harvey too 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.200
 frequently then unfortunately damaged because 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.670
 if they are the third and fourth in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.950
 brÃ¼hl week 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.569
 that is often so that the woman is not yet 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.430
 She knows that she is pregnant when she is 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.239
 then on the fete of alcohol then drinks 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.889
 Unfortunately, there is often a shift 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.889
 Here we see fourth fifth 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.109
 sixth week and here then seventh eighth 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.950
 week in the completely all organs 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.019
 be created 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.870
 I tell myself this is the embryonic one 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.200
 period and is reversed as something like 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.940
 a 33 centimeters long is the after 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.680
 embryo at most and then the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.090
 completely finished when all organ systems 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.450
 already created and that is one 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.430
 fascinating thing and after that I have 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.739
 then actually only a growth in size 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.169
 or length growth and of course still 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.940
 delicacies within the organo genesis 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.630
 So here you always see very clearly 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.000
 if we're down here it's already 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.290
 finished and that means I have 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.419
 but only in length of one 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.519
 hennemann weight growth and detail 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.810
 change within the agrana genesis 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.069
 yes, when, so to speak, you know if it is one 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.810
 girl or a boy will be the 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.190
 Parents always knew that or some 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.099
 at least I wanted to know 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.930
 and from the twelfth week you can do it 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.639
 almost certainly determine from the 16th 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.959
 twentieth week actually relative 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:24.090
 sure so that should be remembered 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.090
