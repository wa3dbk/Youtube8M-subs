00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
impressions but here's the thing both

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.800 
impressions but here's the thing both
sides<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.280> right<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.570> nothing

against<00:01:37.439> Pokemon<00:01:37.890> whatsoever<00:01:38.580> do<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
against Pokemon whatsoever do I think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.469 
against Pokemon whatsoever do I think
it's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> property<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.900> fun<00:01:40.140> game<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.970> kind

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
it's a property of fun game is it a kind

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.130 
it's a property of fun game is it a kind
of<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.750> easy<00:01:43.409> type<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> JRPG<00:01:44.820> overall<00:01:45.510> yes<00:01:45.900> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of like easy type of JRPG overall yes I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
of like easy type of JRPG overall yes I
do<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:47.700> simplistic

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
do think so it's a very simplistic

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.590 
do think so it's a very simplistic
concept<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.900> recycles<00:01:49.619> itself<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.360> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
concept it recycles itself a lot but it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.950 
concept it recycles itself a lot but it
is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> good<00:01:52.590> concept<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> very<00:01:54.420> own

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
is a good concept it is a very own

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.289 
is a good concept it is a very own
concept<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.920> over<00:01:56.340> time<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:56.909> gone<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
concept and over time and has gone to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.820 
concept and over time and has gone to
the<00:01:57.390> point<00:01:57.600> where<00:01:58.080> has<00:01:58.229> become<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> very

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
the point where has become a very

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.950 
the point where has become a very
expanded<00:01:59.490> concept<00:01:59.909> we're<00:02:00.060> saying<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
expanded concept we're saying that is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.469 
expanded concept we're saying that is
super<00:02:01.590> simplistic<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.820> later<00:02:03.030> versions

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
super simplistic and the later versions

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
super simplistic and the later versions
is<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:04.079> under<00:02:04.229> estimating<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.369> actual

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
is actually under estimating the actual

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.710 
is actually under estimating the actual
strategy<00:02:05.939> involved<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.140> game<00:02:07.350> so

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
strategy involved in the game so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.819 
strategy involved in the game so
pokemons<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> those<00:02:10.049> things<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.350> just<00:02:10.380> feel

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
pokemons one of those things I just feel

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.430 
pokemons one of those things I just feel
that<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:12.150> wasn't<00:02:12.329> in<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.600> zone<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that I just wasn't in that zone it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.289 
that I just wasn't in that zone it
wasn't<00:02:13.829> that<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.950> intentionally<00:02:14.489> ignored<00:02:15.120> it

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
wasn't that I intentionally ignored it

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.750 
wasn't that I intentionally ignored it
it<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.170> when<00:02:16.560> Pokemon<00:02:17.100> came<00:02:17.310> out<00:02:17.489> I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it was just that when Pokemon came out I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.330 
it was just that when Pokemon came out I
