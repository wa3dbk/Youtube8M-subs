00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello here we are going to show you an option 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.890
 so that you create your own birth with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.570
 materials very easy to find and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.140
 it can also be a nice 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.830
 gift for this christmas 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.220
 we're going to need a river stone 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.130
 matches 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.699
 of those who come with waxed paper a 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.230
 piece of metallic thread that we are going to 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.100
 use to make the aureole pebbles 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.150
 to decorate 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.160
 a piece of tree bark 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.530
 sticks 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.320
 still life a pair of tweezers to be able 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.260
 cut the sticks a pencil a scissors 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.260
 hot silicone and a pin we're going to 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.540
 begin to open the matches this we 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.450
 we are going to support with a pin we are going to 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.970
 try to open what is from the center 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.180
 of seville the match is formed by 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.120
 a piece of paper that is waxed and is 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.630
 rolled up let's try to find what 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.380
 which is the center of the match and extend 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.920
 what is the waxed paper sheet 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 trying not to destroy what is the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.990
 little head of the match 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.270
 we are going to extend the little leaf that this is going to 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.100
 be what we are going to use as the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.289
 body of the characters of the birth 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.689
 this when you do it, try 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.960
 lean on a table or desk 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.619
 so that if the match is not them 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.619
 go to the floor 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 we open it as much as it can be extended 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.280
 the match that this is going to serve us as 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.000
 if it was the tunic of each of the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.000
 characters 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.720
 just like this we're going to need to have 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.570
 two zeros for each character so 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.970
 can use six to eight or ten 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.550
 it depends on those who want to do and what 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.910
 basic here is to unite the two matches 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.010
 leaving a single head so we're going 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.000
 to cut what is the head of a 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.780
 match and let's put together a character 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 sticking with silicone the two parts for 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.270
 Arming our character this will depend 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.090
 from the height of the match so that 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.550
 you see there what will be the one 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.740
 will be like san jose and if the virgin 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.320
 is a little more crouched or if the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.880
 angel is higher than you dp 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.880
 how do you like it 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.689
 here you can also support yourself with 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.939
 a milestone pencil this will make them more 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.359
 easy work because it is easier to give 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:58.500
 shape the character and by having it we are going to 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.510
 generate now an aura to put 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.270
 I suggest that the halo be placed 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.120
 before mounting the character on the 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.250
 stone you give the shape they give 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.710
 crouched they want it to be in this case 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.710
 the virgin and we're going to use a 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.290
 small piece of bark so that this 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.080
 be like the pcb to make the little boy 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.010
 God let's leave a match very 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.290
 tiny and then with a piece of the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.560
 matches that we have opened we are going to do 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.620
 as if it were the blanket or the blanket and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.060
 we 're going to wrap it up all this we 're going to 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.060
 join with silicone 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.760
 we let the head come out a little 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.250
 nothing else 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.250
 and we are going to accommodate and shape 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.560
 also here I suggest that you first 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.340
 put on the halo before riding them 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.340
 on the stone 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.700
 Now let's start making 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.430
 little angel that is of the characters that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.480
 can you say is the most laborious we are going to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.650
 need 2 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.160
 pieces because we are going to generate here what 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.739
 what are the wings are we going to form the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.169
 figure of the wings with the pencil and then 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.510
 take advantage of the design of a part to 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.770
 mount it on the other part be like 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:32.360
 found and we're going to do the trimming 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:36.409
 this design we are going to join the two wings 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.740
 they will be stuck and after that 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.879
 we paste them we are going to put them in the 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.879
 from the back of the angel 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.980
 all this as we are doing here 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.290
 everything is glued with silicone 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.750
 also for the angel there is 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.010
 hit the halo before riding 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.010
 on the stone 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.789
 we already have the birth ready we are missing 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.229
 put what is the portal 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.990
 let's go measuring here our 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.300
 bits that we have of sticks that 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 we are at the same height there are more or 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.570
 the less we use the bark we have 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.070
 adjusting the size and well as I say 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.650
 the silicone here is also us 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.780
 doing wonders because easy it 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.070
 accommodate the material we have is nothing 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.729
 more go creating now that the idea that 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.729
 let's have 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.760
 this design with what we have our 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.040
 creativity and then patience and a lot 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.810
 love the star of course not 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.330
 must miss we will support ourselves with a 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.550
 bit of wire or even with a 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.040
 pin anyway we put him 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.290
 silicon and we put it between the bark and 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.330
 there it will be very good is a detail that 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.889
 should not be lost in the portal the 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.169
 star 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.159
 and with the pieces of bark too 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.629
 They can decorate it is to taste 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.419
 everyone can not forget the 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:08.319
 details and one of them is the staff of 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:11.980
 our lord san jose then we go to 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:14.360
 generate it with a bit 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.630
 of the match 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.120
 and ready 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:23.190
 This is a very nice detail to have 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.190
 at home or even to give as a gift 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.130
 we wish you a very happy Christmas
