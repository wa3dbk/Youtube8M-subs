00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
safe mode is that you can do some

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:04.149 
safe mode is that you can do some
formatting<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:02.120> what's<00:01:02.329> what's<00:01:03.159> useless

somebody $150 to repair so let beep once
while<00:01:12.890> we're<00:01:13.040> holding<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.340> down<00:01:13.520> twice<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.450> it

while we're holding it down twice and it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.390 
while we're holding it down twice and it
goes<00:01:14.660> into<00:01:14.840> off<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.860> we're<00:01:15.950> going<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.160> hold<00:01:16.310> it

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
goes into off and we're going to hold it

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.960 
goes into off and we're going to hold it
again<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.260> going<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.470> beep<00:01:18.650> once

there's<00:01:22.970> going<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.150> be<00:01:23.210> twice<00:01:23.930> to

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
there's going to be twice to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.840 
there's going to be twice to
consecutively<00:01:24.800> like<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.550> then<00:01:25.760> we're

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
consecutively like that and then we're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.450 
consecutively like that and then we're
going<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.000> let<00:01:26.150> go

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.820 

and<00:01:30.790> then<00:01:31.180> go<00:01:31.720> into<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.050> city<00:01:32.560> come<00:01:32.710> on

the loop so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.170> actually<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.750> fix

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
going to actually go in here and fix

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.540 
going to actually go in here and fix
this<00:02:16.959> problem<00:02:17.380> through<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> techniques<00:02:18.400> I'm

this problem through the techniques I'm

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.890 
this problem through the techniques I'm
showing<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> step-by-step<00:02:19.630> guide

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
showing you and the step-by-step guide

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.520 
showing you and the step-by-step guide
so<00:02:20.530> I'll<00:02:21.130> be<00:02:21.400> back<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.880> few<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.390> take<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.349> look

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
so I'll be back in a few and take a look

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.890 
so I'll be back in a few and take a look
at<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.709> step-by-step<00:02:24.310> guide<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.910> will

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
at this step-by-step guide and will

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:35.490 
at this step-by-step guide and will
repair<00:02:26.319> this<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.500> Playstation

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:59.610 

you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.360 

so<00:03:00.620> once<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.310> update<00:03:01.460> is<00:03:01.940> complete<00:03:03.220> it'll<00:03:04.220> be

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
so once the update is complete it'll be

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.360 
so once the update is complete it'll be
prop<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.970> need<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.450> actually<00:03:05.890> go<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.100> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
prop the need to actually go in and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.780 
prop the need to actually go in and
actually<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.890> set<00:03:09.890> up<00:03:09.920> your<00:03:10.190> username

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
actually you know set up your username

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.070 
actually you know set up your username
your<00:03:11.240> timezone<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:13.300> your<00:03:14.300> network<00:03:14.630> settings

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
your timezone and your network settings

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.820 
your timezone and your network settings
