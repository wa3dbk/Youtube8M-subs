vehicle<00:02:53.859> over<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> years<00:02:54.489> basically<00:02:55.120> all

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
vehicle over the years basically all

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.750 
vehicle over the years basically all
this<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.540> owner<00:02:55.690> has<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.049> do<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.549> choose<00:02:57.549> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
this the owner has to do is choose the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.370 
this the owner has to do is choose the
terrain<00:02:58.090> type<00:02:58.359> that<00:02:58.510> they're<00:02:58.630> driving<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.109> and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
terrain type that they're driving on and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.979 
terrain type that they're driving on and
the<00:02:59.829> vehicle<00:03:00.069> then<00:03:00.519> makes<00:03:00.790> adjustments<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.959> a

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the vehicle then makes adjustments to a

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.990 
the vehicle then makes adjustments to a
variety<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.560> systems<00:03:02.859> that<00:03:03.430> allows<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
variety of systems that allows the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.059 
variety of systems that allows the
vehicle<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.420> drive<00:03:04.600> easier<00:03:05.349> through<00:03:05.890> that

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
vehicle to drive easier through that

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.830 
vehicle to drive easier through that
terrain<00:03:06.430> which<00:03:06.760> ultimately<00:03:07.000> makes<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.540> easier

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
terrain which ultimately makes it easier
