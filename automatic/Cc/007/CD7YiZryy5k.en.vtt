00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:24.329
 hello friday videoblog go 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.669
 the height of halloween discounted garage 3 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.489
 thousands of flashing lights and night card 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.540
 The celebration will last until November 4th so 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.920
 that chant hi continue 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.140
 work on new physics 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 they demanded in more time than we 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 initially counted what difficulties 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 arose when creating this update 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.930
 at what stage is she currently 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 Now tell the first mass 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 testing a new physical model 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.570
 we conducted tank movements in September 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.460
 she let us collect your feedback and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 discover lam complicated massage style 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 showed that due to the increased speed 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.140
 There were problems with processing 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.859
 collisions of tanks with each other and with 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 obstacles 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 if the tank is going too fast then he 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 can pass through obstacles in such 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.360
 it was impossible to release the update 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 and we sent it for revision 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.259
 physics engine engine refinement 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 big challenge it took 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.130
 few weeks at the moment work 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.840
 not finished yet but ready 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.479
 workable intermediate build 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 which is currently being tested 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.319
 if testing is successful 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.720
 no serious flaws will be revealed 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.580
 update will be put on the basis we 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 we hope that this will happen before the end but 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.660
 and brand however anyway after 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.179
 this will require minor modifications 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.410
 at the entrance we will first see steadily 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.050
 working physics 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.340
 and then we will bring it to the ideal of physics 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.239
 tied several other major 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.619
 updates 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.569
 so we try to do everything 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.520
 possible to put it on the basis of how 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.810
 as soon as possible while the programmers were 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 are busy changing the code we 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.840
 modifying the parameters of the tanks, taking into account 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.060
 player wishes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.709
 the overall concept has remained unchanged 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 increase the dynamics and give everyone 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.880
 the hull of the uniqueness of the tanks in the new 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590
 physicists have returned the buildup of course 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.720
 not any tank will succeed in swinging 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.759
 mammoth for example, little will happen but 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.270
 light and medium bodies have this 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.310
 property 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.410
 slightly decreased tank speed this 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.399
 caused by a technical need for 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.840
 error minimization 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.430
 however, the difference with the first option 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.020
 physicists almost imperceptible 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.270
 and tanks will still be noticeable 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.280
 faster than the movement of buildings 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.379
 became a little smoother without jerking and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 dizzying turns and put 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.960
 a tank on its hind legs is far from easy 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.550
 as in the first version of the new physics 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.870
 the rest of the corps behave the same way 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.060
 as during the first mass 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 test update updates 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 touched and guns we took a step more 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.940
 playable changing while charging and 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.130
 reload time between shots 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.110
 increased to 8 seconds at maximum 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.280
 charge accumulates in just three twins 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.900
 now possesses the same 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.150
 rate of fire regardless of 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.810
 modification m0 shoots just as fast 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.580
 as m3 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.590
 however, the speed of the ball remains 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.360
 reduced relative to the base therefore 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.370
 dodge the crown will be easier 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.960
 changed the effect of friezes frozen 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.700
 the tank will defrost faster 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.650
 besides the physical has changed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.480
 impact blows recoil all guns 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.130
 increased it means that the sight 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.640
 it will be easier for the enemy to shoot down 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.870
 increased turning speed of all guns 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.340
 optimistic forecast is as follows 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.080
 two weeks will end the inner 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.330
 testing updates and will be made 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.620
 the last necessary improvements and if 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.210
 everything goes well then we will open 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.220
 test server for load 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.840
 tests of new physics if i don't 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.550
 will reveal serious update errors 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.670
 will be based on in the second half 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.670

 sports news 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.980
 in the tournament the capture of the card continues 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.500
 the super final and in incredibly intense 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.760
 fight on the sandbox snk regained the most 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.860
 prestigious card game 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.750
 and all or nothing defended the bard 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.520
 the rest of the super final and look in 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.370
 next week on our sport 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.900
 channel 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.700
 question-answer daniel feed chokes 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.770
 asks if there will be an opportunity 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.840
 send private messages to friends 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.940
 creating such an opportunity is worth 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.520
 development plans but when will it 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.770
 Taken into work while we can not say 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.810
 we will keep you posted Andrei andrey 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.880
 and interested in the dropout algorithm 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.920
 golden box rostislav ovcharuk 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.800
 indignant why come in 15000 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.540
 crystals goal never fell out every time 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.880
 by increasing the battle fund by one 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.400
 crystal server randomly decides 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.050
 hunger or not likely 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.300
 positive one to seven 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.430
 thousands roughly speaking whenever 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.010
 foundation increases server turns the drum 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.170
 in which 7000 sectors and only one 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.300
 of them gold gold can fall on 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.000
 any foundation 200 such crystals and 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.640
 may not even fall out with a fund of 15,000 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.500
 Genadi M wants to know why the regime 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.040
 point control is not on all maps 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.930
 in order for this mode to be and 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.180
 sen he needs certain cards 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.310
 configuration can not just take any 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.740
 map and add control points to it 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.930
 on most levels it will just 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.330
 not playable so this mode 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.470
 There is only on 10 maps by the way 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.050
 flag capture 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.710
 a similar story it is not for example on 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.990
 training ground 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.250
 because in terms of gameplay this 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.320
 pointless October 29 in our group 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.200
 VKontakte started a small contest 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.590
 evolution then in it you need to match 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.980
 4 objects ascending from m0 to m3 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:13.610
 thereby showing evolution for example here 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:16.560
 so the authors of the best works will get 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.860
 crystal prizes link to contest as 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.480
 always under the video 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.100
 question of the week last time you need 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.770
 was guessing what would happen with two 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:34.050
 fingers on the bridge in the end they both 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:36.830
 fell we meet the winners and look 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.830
 new question 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.970
 on this all subscribe to the channel there 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.130
 the twitter and watch the group VKontakte 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.820
 news and of course like 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.820
 until
