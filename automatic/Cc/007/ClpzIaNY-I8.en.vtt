hello friends welcome to the new way

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.499 
hello friends welcome to the new way
with<00:00:05.759> testing<00:00:06.210> new<00:00:07.020> Nissan<00:00:07.740> Qashqai<00:00:11.509> let's

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
with testing new Nissan Qashqai let's

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.079 
with testing new Nissan Qashqai let's
talk<00:00:12.719> outside<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.790> first<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
talk outside so first of all the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.820 
talk outside so first of all the
appearance<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.230> still<00:00:16.529> looks<00:00:16.740> like

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
appearance you know it still looks like

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
appearance you know it still looks like
a<00:00:16.949> cache<00:00:17.220> line<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:18.060> there's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> lot<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
a cache line but there's a lot of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.400 
a cache line but there's a lot of
technology<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:19.890> example<00:00:20.310> we've<00:00:20.460> adopted

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
technology so for example we've adopted

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:30.040 
technology so for example we've adopted
LED<00:00:22.670> advanced<00:00:23.810> there's<00:00:24.810> lots<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.580> technology

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280 

on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> car<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.340> g40<00:00:33.000> kilograms<00:00:33.600> lighter

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
on the car it's a g40 kilograms lighter

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.430 
on the car it's a g40 kilograms lighter
than<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.219> previous<00:00:35.250> car<00:00:35.899> we've<00:00:36.899> also<00:00:37.050> had<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
than the previous car we've also had to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860 
than the previous car we've also had to
use<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> technology<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.910> achieve<00:00:39.000> 99

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
use a lot that technology to achieve 99

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
use a lot that technology to achieve 99

is<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:06.370> complete<00:05:06.940> change<00:05:06.970> from<00:05:07.740> Nissan's

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
is a complete change from Nissan's

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.499 
is a complete change from Nissan's

speed<00:05:17.500> during<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.949> city<00:05:18.419> so<00:05:19.419> if<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.930> quiet<00:05:20.259> but

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590

speed during the city so if a quiet but
then<00:05:20.770> at<00:05:21.160> higher<00:05:21.880> engine<00:05:22.569> revs<00:05:22.960> at<00:05:23.199> high

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
then at higher engine revs at high

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.969 
then at higher engine revs at high
speeds<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:24.130> get<00:05:24.580> more<00:05:24.729> of<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.940> step<00:05:25.210> 3<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.479> the
