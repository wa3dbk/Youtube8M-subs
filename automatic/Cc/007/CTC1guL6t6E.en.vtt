00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.609
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.620
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.929
 I will tell you about why sprouting bad 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.920
 or not planted by you at all 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.920
 seeds for seedlings 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 here very often gardeners sowing seeds 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.560
 waiting waiting waiting waiting pass all 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.080
 possible dates nothing appears or 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 appears very bad not amicably on 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 in fact, there may be many reasons 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 you can sow perfectly high quality and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 healthy good seeds nor does it 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.550
 get a positive result here 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 Now I will tell you 5 reasons why 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 even good seeds can you have 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.260
 sprout bad or not at all 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.969
 germinated one of the reasons maybe 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 the expired shelf life of your seeds 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.050
 Well, in general, gardeners often ask 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 completely reasonable I'm just a man 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 seeds generally keep going yourself in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.270
 shop or garden center where the seeds 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.239
 flax and just made whole racks 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 chose the right one 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.320
 all seeds have expiration date 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.420
 specified deadline implementation here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 for example, 2018 and what seeds 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.430
 long enough can be stored 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.170
 but many gardeners buy seeds 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.570
 not in stores they 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.759
 procure themselves and really 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.390
 seeds can in principle lose due 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.310
 the fact that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159
 stored for too long its germination 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.100
 in order to prevent this from happening if 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.780
 you harvest the seeds yourself 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.490
 be sure to keep in paper bags 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.650
 Be sure to specify 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.439
 period when you collected them then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.100
 sure you say so most likely not 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.630
 expire and their validity 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.170
 especially quickly lose their germination seeds 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.729
 spicy herbs carrot onion seeds here 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 one two years only they can 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 store otherwise they will not ascend just 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.750
 longest keep their vigilants 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.990
 large seeds such as courgette beans 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.299
 and pumpkins and by the way these are 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.329
 interesting popular cultures like 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.070
 It is better to sow tomatoes and cucumbers not on 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.380
 next year after collecting the seeds 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.500
 but withstand them 2 then even three years of their 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.879
 germination only from this improves 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 also significantly affects germination 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.979
 seeds with their particularly long 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.640
 storage 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.380
 it is of course the surrounding temperate 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.390
 and the higher the temperature the seeds 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.040
 breathes more actively the more dude 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.430
 internal process oxidation process 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.580
 and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.530
 and my advice to you if you leave 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.080
 the seeds are stored but did not have time to snatch 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.819
 leftover you left the best places 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.540
 for their storage it's packed 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.630
 tea bags 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.590
 on the side top shelf of your 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.450
 the fridge 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.250
 here is optimal for them 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.590
 temperature of course in a plastic bag 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.510
 better or use special 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.910
 seeds in the package such foil 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.870
 there is metal inside the foil 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.220
 here is the most optimal for them 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.350
 storage temperature 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510
 another very important factor right 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.190
 storage is moisture well here now 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.720
 cheese is wet if you leave in your 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.400
 garden house where most likely too 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.019
 there will be a lot of humidity 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.030
 some seeds may mold 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.489
 some bend some even 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.560
 germinate under suitable conditions therefore 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.200
 Store seeds on top 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.410
 dried thoroughly and store them in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.660
 where humidity is enough 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.640
 low dry they must therefore be 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.230
 even hermetically desirable 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.570
 pack if you have such 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.670
 opportunity air is another interesting 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.590
 seed storage factor is generally like 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.930
 rule of all seed packages 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.450
 air is pumped out the other way around and here 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.870
 need a minimum there but there is an exception 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.700
 let's say here are the big bean seeds 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.220
 legumes some crops maize them 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.560
 on the contrary, they are stored with a large amount 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.989
 air is therefore usually stored in linen 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.019
 some bags in open banks here 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.480
 such an exception to the rules 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.540
 another very important germination factor 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.880
 seeds is the absence of light during their 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.440
 long-term storage do that light 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.690
 7 we need only at the moment already 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.180
 direct seeding master moment 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.799
 sprouting them while they are stored they must 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.959
 kept in complete darkness you drew 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.239
 attention when we shoot stories about 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.640
 seeds after racks with seeds here 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.739
 dark enough that that the room where 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.110
 they are kept very very poorly lit and 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.570
 it comes from amateur gardeners if 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.400
 you pack your own 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.970
 seeds must use dense 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
 paper 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.470
 take on use some foil for 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.930
 to light on your seeds for stocks 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.000
 your seeds acted as little as possible 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.260
 another option why you are not easy 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.420
 the cost of doing what with the names of many 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.490
 crops 3 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.440
 pretreatment processing 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.450
 the most diverse may be many 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.730
 by the way manufacturers say such 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.400
 the processing is done at home and on 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.100
 A sachet indicates that scarification is already 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.960
 not required many seeds require 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.640
 stratification the so -called we about it 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.860
 special plot already filmed 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.780
 chilling u say lavender 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.160
 for example, we need to take at least a month 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.650
 hold it at very low 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.280
 the temperature of the order there 3 4 5 degrees 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.650
 heat is another such important factor 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.030
 seed germination is planting in 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.190
 certain terms as a rule 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.930
 growers on seed points here 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.420
 hand drawn still seed form 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.660
 April-May in these terms optimally 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.820
 network this culture although of course it's time 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.010
 depends on your specific region 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.730
 another very common mistake is too 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.410
 deep seeding 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.540
 if you sow very deeply 100 all 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.400
 sprout will spend its strength on 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.890
 to break through this thick of the earth in 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.120
 As a result, he will certainly grow but 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.430
 breaks it thicker but grows up already 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.020
 weakened enough well and finally 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.820
 The last factor is very important which 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.500
 often disturb this temperature 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.480
 seed germination 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.730
 the fact is that too low 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.920
 temperature it tends to slow down and 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.140
 stops the seed growth process exactly 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.090
 too high temperature too 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.520
 especially now often do what bling 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.110
 put a parnichok on the battery 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.240
 central heating cessna 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.980
 the temperature is so high that the ground 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.630
 dries out you don't have time and just even 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.850
 during moisturize especially if you are not 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.240
 covered and something there polyethylene 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.410
 package or this special lid 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.150
 optimum temperature for germination 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.750
 seedlings any considered 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:08.340
 range from plus 15 degrees to plus 25 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:11.250
 degrees and so today he talked about 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.460
 What factors can lead to 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.500
 that your seeds will not germinate 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.290
 if it germinates, it will look very 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.720
 bad here is compliance with these basic 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.430
 rules will most likely give you the opportunity 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.060
 grow normal healthy strong 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.980
 times on 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.500
 but I say goodbye to this, see
