00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.439
 It had been subjected to a club card 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.439
 I understand that it will be my friend 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.490

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:28.750
 Bell Iga I thought you were on my side 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.900
 Not interesting with a simple game 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.300
 I have something I want you to remember 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.380
 It might have been 8 but I sucked what I was taught 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.130
 Be a woman 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.509

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.820

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.820

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.820
 It has been a good face for a long time 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.090
 It would have been nice to ask a lesbian man 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:17.799
 It really means that you feel comfortable 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.799
 You understand luck, I spend one hour in precious things over my life 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.459
 You are humble 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.450
 Such things create a room from chance 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.819
 Necessity to remain at the station 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.270
 I wonder if there is ever thought about luck 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.569
 Become lol 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.730
 It was well thought 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.830
 There are a lot of continuations of the previous stroke 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.110
 It is okay separately 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.170

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.319
 I had a brother 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.770
 Standing as two brothers with no jeopardy 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:59.620
 But was killed is called a hitchhiker think the car when there 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.620
 It was pushed into the trunk of the car and left in the benzene ring 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.049
 Suffering from dehydration and dyspnea 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.049
 I ran out of power in the dark and died
