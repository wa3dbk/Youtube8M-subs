00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
first and that's fine and then you have

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
first and that's fine and then you have
teams<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.490> Swansea<00:01:50.939> who<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.270> pass<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.689> to

death and attack attack attack you've

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850

got teams like Chelsea who will pass it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
got teams like Chelsea who will pass it
but<00:01:56.100> also<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.969> mental<00:01:57.750> counter-attacking

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
runs and things like that so I know that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
runs and things like that so I know that
when<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.140> into<00:02:01.320> each<00:02:01.560> game<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.009> FIFA<00:02:02.430> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
when I go into each game on FIFA in

when I go into each game on FIFA in
career<00:02:03.180> mode<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.780> how<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> play

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
career mode and I know how to play

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
career mode and I know how to play
against<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.950> each<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> work<00:02:06.030> on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
against that each time because I work on

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.180 
against that each time because I work on
my<00:02:06.390> tactics<00:02:06.869> behind<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.799> scenes<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.160> little

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
my tactics behind the scenes a little

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740 
my tactics behind the scenes a little
bit<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> tweak<00:02:09.209> my<00:02:09.239> custom

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
bit and I like to tweak my custom

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.589 
bit and I like to tweak my custom
tactics<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.649> way<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.790> like

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
tactics so this way I could have like

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.530 
tactics so this way I could have like
none<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.140> hassle

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
none of the hassle

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.330 
none of the hassle
of<00:02:13.599> changing<00:02:13.989> my<00:02:14.019> tactics<00:02:14.500> every<00:02:14.799> single<00:02:15.010> game

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
of changing my tactics every single game

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.949 
of changing my tactics every single game
wouldn't<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.329> any<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.659> I<00:02:16.750> can

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
wouldn't have to do any of that I can

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.319 
wouldn't have to do any of that I can
just<00:02:17.079> use<00:02:17.230> tight<00:02:17.439> like<00:02:17.739> custom<00:02:18.099> tactic<00:02:18.430> ABCD

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
just use tight like custom tactic ABCD

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.539 
just use tight like custom tactic ABCD
whatever<00:02:19.719> and<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.769> would<00:02:20.920> work<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.280> each

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
whatever and it would work on each

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.589 
whatever and it would work on each
different<00:02:21.730> team<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.120> think<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.390> would<00:02:22.510> be

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
different team I think that would be

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.869 
different team I think that would be
really<00:02:22.629> handy<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:24.069> next<00:02:24.310> thing<00:02:24.549> that

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
really handy and the next thing that

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.209 
really handy and the next thing that
they've<00:02:25.239> said<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.590> team<00:02:26.859> sheets<00:02:27.099> are

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
they've said is that team sheets are

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.530 
they've said is that team sheets are
available<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.700> career<00:02:27.909> mode<00:02:27.969> match<00:02:28.299> day

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
available in career mode match day

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.229 
online friendlies and tournaments I
don't<00:02:30.430> really<00:02:30.519> think<00:02:30.609> there's<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.939> whole<00:02:31.090> lot

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
don't really think there's a whole lot

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.729 
don't really think there's a whole lot
to<00:02:31.390> say<00:02:31.540> about<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.170> would<00:02:32.409> be<00:02:32.530> quite

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
to say about that it would be quite

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.500 
to say about that it would be quite
handy<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.250> use<00:02:33.280> stuff<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.909> on<00:02:34.030> ultimate

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.069 
of costs and tactics whatsoever and then
I<00:04:06.729> found<00:04:06.909> that<00:04:07.150> as<00:04:07.239> soon<00:04:07.359> as<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.599> did<00:04:07.840> apply

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
I found that as soon as I did apply

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.009 
I found that as soon as I did apply
custom<00:04:08.409> tactics<00:04:08.979> and<00:04:09.159> I<00:04:09.189> was<00:04:09.340> able<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.970> work<00:04:10.810> it

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
custom tactics and I was able to work it

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.319 
custom tactics and I was able to work it
in<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.229> way<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:11.409> suited<00:04:12.009> me<00:04:12.040> best<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.759> played

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
in a way that suited me best I played

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.420 
in a way that suited me best I played
some<00:04:13.599> of<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.810> best<00:04:14.019> leonel<00:04:14.769> football<00:04:15.159> in<00:04:15.310> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
some of the best leonel football in the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.520 
some of the best leonel football in the
game<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.759> I<00:04:15.790> ever<00:04:15.970> played<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:17.019> think<00:04:17.139> it's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
game that I ever played so I think it's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.779 
game that I ever played so I think it's
really<00:04:17.889> helpful<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.400> they're<00:04:18.549> going<00:04:18.699> to

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
really helpful that they're going to

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.210 
really helpful that they're going to
make<00:04:18.970> all<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.449> lot<00:04:19.750> easier<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.409> and<00:04:21.130> it

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
make all of that a lot easier and and it

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.370 
make all of that a lot easier and and it
seems<00:04:21.609> as<00:04:21.849> though<00:04:21.909> custom<00:04:22.599> tactics<00:04:22.990> won't<00:04:23.169> be

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
seems as though custom tactics won't be

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.470 
seems as though custom tactics won't be
as<00:04:23.500> difficult<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.510> comprise<00:04:25.510> as<00:04:25.900> they<00:04:26.200> are

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
as difficult to comprise as they are

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
but i hope that it just means a little

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.090 
but i hope that it just means a little
bit<00:05:44.840> more<00:05:45.050> in<00:05:45.200> this<00:05:45.320> one<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.710> it's<00:05:45.860> just

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
bit more in this one and it's just

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.800 
bit more in this one and it's just

easier for everybody to set up at the

tactics and this is default team tactic
to<00:05:52.250> each<00:05:52.430> of<00:05:52.610> your<00:05:52.700> team<00:05:52.940> sheet<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.360> your<00:05:53.480> game

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
to each of your team sheet so your game

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.300 
to each of your team sheet so your game
plan<00:05:53.900> is<00:05:53.960> locked<00:05:54.320> before<00:05:54.560> hitting<00:05:54.950> the<00:05:55.040> pitch

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310

i'm<00:05:55.670> reading<00:05:56.000> this<00:05:56.120> straight<00:05:56.390> off<00:05:56.510> the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
i'm reading this straight off the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.830 
i'm reading this straight off the
website<00:05:56.840> but<00:05:57.590> am<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:58.370> i<00:05:58.730> hope<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.450> this<00:05:59.480> is

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
website but am this i hope that this is

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.240 
website but am this i hope that this is
just<00:06:00.080> some<00:06:00.320> sort<00:06:00.350> of<00:06:00.830> an<00:06:01.750> easier<00:06:02.750> way<00:06:02.960> of

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
just some sort of an easier way of

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.160 
just some sort of an easier way of
configuring<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.850> current<00:06:05.270> custom<00:06:05.540> tactic

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
configuring the current custom tactic

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.930 
configuring the current custom tactic
setup<00:06:06.440> that<00:06:06.590> they<00:06:06.680> have<00:06:06.860> in<00:06:07.070> fifa<00:06:07.370> 14<00:06:07.580> because

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
setup that they have in fifa 14 because

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.360 
setup that they have in fifa 14 because
it<00:06:08.390> is<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.570> little<00:06:08.780> bit<00:06:08.960> like<00:06:09.290> i<00:06:09.590> don't<00:06:10.310> know

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
it is a little bit like i don't know

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.800 
it is a little bit like i don't know
it's<00:06:10.550> kind<00:06:10.760> of<00:06:10.820> tedious<00:06:11.000> to<00:06:11.390> wrap<00:06:11.510> your<00:06:11.660> head

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
it's kind of tedious to wrap your head

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.180 
it's kind of tedious to wrap your head
around<00:06:11.840> and<00:06:12.290> this<00:06:12.410> seems<00:06:12.620> like<00:06:12.710> it'll<00:06:12.980> just

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
around and this seems like it'll just

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.650 
around and this seems like it'll just
make<00:06:13.310> it<00:06:13.370> a<00:06:13.520> lot<00:06:13.700> easier<00:06:13.730> because<00:06:14.060> it's<00:06:14.450> spread

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
make it a lot easier because it's spread

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.380 
make it a lot easier because it's spread
across<00:06:14.840> several<00:06:15.170> game<00:06:15.470> modes<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:16.210> and<00:06:17.210> i

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
across several game modes and and i

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.730 
across several game modes and and i
think<00:06:17.420> that's<00:06:17.840> just<00:06:17.990> what<00:06:18.200> it<00:06:18.290> is<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.530> next

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
think that's just what it is the next

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.710 
think that's just what it is the next
screenshot<00:06:18.950> after<00:06:19.460> that<00:06:19.610> is<00:06:19.790> just<00:06:19.820> a<00:06:20.360> basic

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
screenshot after that is just a basic

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.920 
screenshot after that is just a basic
picture<00:06:21.080> of<00:06:21.470> what<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:22.210> it<00:06:23.210> has<00:06:23.390> a<00:06:23.420> picture<00:06:23.750> of

picture of what the it has a picture of

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.990 
picture of what the it has a picture of
messy<00:06:24.350> as<00:06:24.440> a<00:06:24.470> centre-forward<00:06:24.860> an<00:06:25.310> 94<00:06:25.670> and<00:06:25.910> it

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
messy as a centre-forward an 94 and it

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.340 
messy as a centre-forward an 94 and it
just<00:06:26.180> says<00:06:26.300> our<00:06:26.450> new<00:06:26.630> all<00:06:26.840> new<00:06:27.050> team
