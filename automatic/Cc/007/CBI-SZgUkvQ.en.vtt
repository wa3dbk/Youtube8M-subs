systems and our cars so some of you may
be<00:00:24.480> wondering<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.590> throttle<00:00:26.250> range

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
be wondering what is throttle range

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.910 
be wondering what is throttle range
programming<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:28.140> does<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.769> why

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
programming and what does it do and why

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560 
programming and what does it do and why
do<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.070> need<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> well<00:00:30.060> basically

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
do I need to do it well basically

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 
do I need to do it well basically
thought<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> range<00:00:31.080> programming<00:00:32.120> tells<00:00:33.120> your

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
where your throttle stick is it'll allow

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
where your throttle stick is it'll allow
it<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:40.530> where<00:00:40.800> neutral<00:00:41.219> position<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it to know where neutral position is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
it to know where neutral position is
where<00:00:41.940> full<00:00:42.239> throttle<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> where<00:00:43.260> full

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
where full throttle is and where full

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160 
where full throttle is and where full
brake<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> symptoms<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> non

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
brake is some of the symptoms of a non

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 
brake is some of the symptoms of a non
properly<00:00:46.739> programmed<00:00:46.980> photo<00:00:47.460> range<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
properly programmed photo range is that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.220 
properly programmed photo range is that
you<00:00:49.590> may<00:00:50.010> either<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.460> no<00:00:50.789> brakes<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.329> once

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you may either have no brakes or once

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.600 
you may either have no brakes or once
you<00:00:52.350> turn<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> car<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> wheels<00:00:53.370> will

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you turn the car on the wheels will

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
you turn the car on the wheels will
start<00:00:54.059> moving<00:00:54.210> forward<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.079> doesn't<00:00:55.320> know

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
start moving forward it it doesn't know

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
start moving forward it it doesn't know
where<00:00:55.710> neutral<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> pull<00:00:57.600> full

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
where neutral is or if you pull full

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
where neutral is or if you pull full
throttle<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.559> you're<00:00:58.829> only<00:00:58.949> getting<00:00:59.190> like

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
throttle and you're only getting like

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
throttle and you're only getting like
quarter<00:00:59.789> throttle<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.199> program

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
quarter throttle so if you do program

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
quarter throttle so if you do program
with<00:01:01.710> Auto<00:01:01.890> range<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> ensure<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.000> get

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
with Auto range you ensure that you get

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.429 
with Auto range you ensure that you get
the<00:01:03.239> most<00:01:03.390> performance<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.199> brush

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the most performance out of your brush

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.190 
the most performance out of your brush
system<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.430> radio<00:01:05.580> system<00:01:05.909> let's<00:01:06.720> go

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
system and your radio system let's go

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.160 
system and your radio system let's go
ahead<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> show<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> guys<00:01:08.250> how<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
ahead and show you guys how to do it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.420 
ahead and show you guys how to do it
alright<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> first<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> do

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
alright so the first thing I like to do

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
alright so the first thing I like to do
is<00:01:11.700> set<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> transmitter<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
is set up the transmitter with the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
is set up the transmitter with the
exceed<00:01:14.159> RC<00:01:14.460> radio<00:01:14.760> systems<00:01:15.119> you'll<00:01:15.299> notice

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
exceed RC radio systems you'll notice

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
exceed RC radio systems you'll notice
that<00:01:15.750> there's<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:15.990> knobs<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> left<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that there's two knobs to the left of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
that there's two knobs to the left of
the<00:01:17.250> steering<00:01:17.400> wheel<00:01:17.640> one's<00:01:18.360> throttle<00:01:18.960> trim

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the steering wheel one's throttle trim

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
the steering wheel one's throttle trim
one<00:01:19.470> steering<00:01:19.770> trim<00:01:20.100> steering<00:01:20.490> shrimp's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
one steering trim steering shrimp's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
one steering trim steering shrimp's
basically<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.479> alignment<00:01:21.869> photo<00:01:22.500> trim<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
basically your alignment photo trim is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.600 
basically your alignment photo trim is
trimming<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:24.090> forward<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.430> brake<00:01:26.430> or

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
trimming it for forward or brake or

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
trimming it for forward or brake or
reverse<00:01:26.939> make<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> throttle<00:01:28.350> trim<00:01:28.590> centered

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
reverse make the throttle trim centered

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.890 
reverse make the throttle trim centered
which<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> pointing<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> arrow<00:01:30.270> straight<00:01:30.720> up

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
which is pointing the arrow straight up

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
which is pointing the arrow straight up
you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> Center<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> steering<00:01:32.610> trim<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.030> well

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you can Center the steering trim as well

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
you can Center the steering trim as well
by<00:01:33.570> pointing<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> arrow<00:01:34.140> straight<00:01:34.470> up

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
by pointing the arrow straight up

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 
by pointing the arrow straight up
another<00:01:35.460> thing<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> check<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
another thing I like to check is the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.190 
another thing I like to check is the
dual<00:01:38.040> rates<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.150> throttle<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.720> rate<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.020> like

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
dual rates the throttle do rate I like

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
dual rates the throttle do rate I like
to<00:01:40.320> max<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:40.860> steering<00:01:41.490> dual<00:01:41.700> rate<00:01:41.850> I'd

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
to max it out steering dual rate I'd

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
to max it out steering dual rate I'd
like<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> max<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
like to max it out as well if you have a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.350 
like to max it out as well if you have a
digital<00:01:45.270> transmitter<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.500> Futaba<00:01:47.360> junior
