00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
have to repeat the process all over

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.180 
have to repeat the process all over
again<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.870> make<00:02:34.049> sure<00:02:34.190> you

then once it's installed that's it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.990 
then once it's installed that's it
that's<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.709> method<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.310> use<00:02:44.340> using<00:02:44.849> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
can use in the clockwork recovery so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.960 
can use in the clockwork recovery so
then<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.500> knew<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:52.799> day<00:02:52.829> you'd<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.579> down<00:02:53.790> to

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
process that for whilst I said but

cm7 you hit your install the Google Apps
that<00:04:13.860> then<00:04:14.790> you'd<00:04:14.970> select<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.709> even

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
that then you'd select so you can even

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
but you might it'll probably just be

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.690 
but you might it'll probably just be

I'm<00:05:22.570> booted<00:05:22.840> up<00:05:22.930> into<00:05:23.170> the<00:05:23.260> siding

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.869 

I'm<00:05:31.930> not<00:05:32.139> it<00:05:32.680> all<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:33.009> does<00:05:33.159> sometimes<00:05:33.460> take<00:05:33.699> a

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
I'm not it all it does sometimes take a

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.959 
I'm not it all it does sometimes take a
while<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.599> get<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:35.250> right<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.280> bit<00:05:36.550> laggy<00:05:36.759> when

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
while to get a right a bit laggy when

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.640 
while to get a right a bit laggy when
you<00:05:37.090> first<00:05:37.270> do<00:05:37.479> it<00:05:37.569> because<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.289> reason<00:05:38.500> that

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
you first do it because the reason that

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.200 
you first do it because the reason that
is<00:05:38.800> all<00:05:39.069> just<00:05:39.430> logs<00:05:39.669> just<00:05:39.879> in<00:05:40.090> recovery<00:05:41.080> mode

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
is all just logs just in recovery mode

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.439 
is all just logs just in recovery mode

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
as well is sometimes when you install

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.269 
as well is sometimes when you install

the Google zip that the Google Apps pack

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.709 
the Google zip that the Google Apps pack
when<00:06:06.520> you<00:06:06.639> reboot<00:06:06.969> the<00:06:07.090> phone<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.419> will<00:06:07.509> come
