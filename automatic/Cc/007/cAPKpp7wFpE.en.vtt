takes just a couple of minutes these
little<00:00:53.000> switches<00:00:53.360> can<00:00:53.510> short<00:00:53.840> out<00:00:53.960> if<00:00:54.800> they

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
little switches can short out if they

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.400 
little switches can short out if they
get<00:00:55.100> wet<00:00:55.370> or<00:00:55.760> or<00:00:56.300> something<00:00:56.809> like<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.110> so<00:00:57.380> I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.640 
now if you're doing your driver's side
the<00:03:06.230> switch<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.590> much<00:03:06.770> larger<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:09.560> know

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the switch is much larger you know

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.030 
the switch is much larger you know
there's<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:11.500> there's<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.560> chance<00:03:12.770> that<00:03:12.860> there

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
there's a there's a chance that there

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.710 
there's a there's a chance that there
might<00:03:13.160> be<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.280> couple<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.730> bolts<00:03:14.060> holding<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
might be a couple of bolts holding the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
might be a couple of bolts holding the
larger<00:03:16.120> switch<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.330> place<00:03:17.540> if<00:03:18.320> that's<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
larger switch in place if that's the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.910 
larger switch in place if that's the
case<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:20.090> would<00:03:20.810> guess<00:03:21.140> they're<00:03:21.350> probably<00:03:21.560> six

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
case I would guess they're probably six

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.850 
case I would guess they're probably six
millimeter<00:03:22.430> bolts<00:03:23.050> or<00:03:24.050> Phillips<00:03:24.500> screws

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
millimeter bolts or Phillips screws

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.920 
millimeter bolts or Phillips screws
either<00:03:25.340> way<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:25.700> be<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> couple<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.810> them

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
either way it just be a couple of them

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.270 
either way it just be a couple of them
you<00:03:27.710> can<00:03:27.830> go<00:03:27.890> ahead<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.130> pull<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.310> right<00:03:28.640> out

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
you can go ahead and pull that right out

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.110 
you can go ahead and pull that right out
there's<00:03:31.280> nothing<00:03:31.489> wrong<00:03:31.610> with<00:03:31.670> our<00:03:31.850> switch

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
there's nothing wrong with our switch

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.520 
there's nothing wrong with our switch
we're<00:03:32.360> going<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.540> snap<00:03:32.720> ours<00:03:32.959> right<00:03:33.140> back<00:03:33.350> into

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
we're going to snap ours right back into

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.660 
we're going to snap ours right back into
place<00:03:33.709> here<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:36.650> want<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.890> indented<00:03:37.280> side<00:03:37.520> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
place here you want the indented side to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.830 
place here you want the indented side to
be<00:03:37.760> down<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:40.160> we'll<00:03:40.280> go<00:03:40.370> ahead<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.580> select<00:03:41.209> app

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
be down so we'll go ahead and select app

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.540 
be down so we'll go ahead and select app
that<00:03:42.050> right<00:03:42.200> back<00:03:42.350> in<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:45.170> like<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.550> locks

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
that right back in just like that locks

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.970 
that right back in just like that locks
right<00:03:46.730> into<00:03:46.910> place<00:03:47.000> there<00:03:47.830> go<00:03:48.830> ahead<00:03:48.890> and

right into place there go ahead and

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.640 
right into place there go ahead and
reconnect<00:03:49.370> our<00:03:49.550> wiring<00:03:49.730> harnesses<00:03:50.239> here<00:03:50.650> it's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
reconnect our wiring harnesses here it's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.870 
reconnect our wiring harnesses here it's
like<00:03:51.739> one<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:51.980> them<00:03:52.100> got<00:03:52.220> trapped<00:03:52.459> inside<00:03:52.640> the
