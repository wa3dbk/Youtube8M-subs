00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.070 
when I'm a bit further down the bowl
well<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.500> smoked<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.310> bit<00:02:55.430> more<00:02:55.580> now<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.300> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
well the smoked a bit more now and the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.120 
well the smoked a bit more now and the
overwhelming<00:02:57.620> thing<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.040> this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
overwhelming thing is that this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.180 
overwhelming thing is that this
smoothness<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:59.060> just<00:02:59.239> staying<00:02:59.540> there<00:02:59.690> and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
smoothness is just staying there and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.830 
smoothness is just staying there and
there<00:03:01.190> isn't<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> bite<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.970> bowl<00:03:02.180> which<00:03:02.690> is

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
there isn't a bite in this bowl which is

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.259 
there isn't a bite in this bowl which is
absolutely<00:03:03.380> gorgeous<00:03:03.880> hmm<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:08.030> vanilla

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
flavor a mixture of this kind of

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.199 
flavor a mixture of this kind of
creaminess<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.310> almost<00:03:10.610> reminding<00:03:11.090> me<00:03:11.180> of

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
creaminess is almost reminding me of

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.570 
creaminess is almost reminding me of
like<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> vanilla<00:03:12.170> custard<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:13.160> an<00:03:13.250> ambrosia
