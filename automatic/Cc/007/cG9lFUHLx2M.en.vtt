00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 planned weight that I want 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.160
 years gone and 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:08.430
 I changed my jeans to jeans on narrow 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.610
 those that are few and few children already 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.979
 many many many places will be more accurate 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 I didnâ€™t climb on dislike bones 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.650
 I still have such a failure today 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.890
 me stress 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:29.540
 I look forward to the time when I can 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 when you do not need to eat and today I ate 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.509
 chocolate biscuit but they are small 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.670
 size but still and most importantly 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:46.140
 I received some news 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:48.899

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.759

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:59.040
 here are these concessions but still girls 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:04.040
 if suddenly this happens why you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 too, pleasure will be stimulated 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:18.450
 I may be so I refuse. I go 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.050

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.830
