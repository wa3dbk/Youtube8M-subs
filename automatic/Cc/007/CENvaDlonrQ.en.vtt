 The electric motor works with itself 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.270
 a gasoline like mitsubishi the

 the four meter thirty long study of the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.259
 cross sport is sort of the pattern 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.210
 future combos and suvs of the brand 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.580
 special value is placed here 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.830
 Comfort comfort and plenty of room

 but also the european auto industry 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.200
 is represented in tokyo 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.000
 especially the German manufacturer at 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.930
 bmw it goes with the four-cabriolet 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.150
 frankly too 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.610
 the special is the tripartite 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.840
 metal folding roof the successful 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.879
 tail design owes you the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.409
 clever folding technique needed here 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.480
 little room to be sacrificed and the 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.430
 tail design does not follow the function 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.430
 that does not succeed every cabriolet

 oxford here in tokyo had the for the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.940
 Japanese market specific variant 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.609

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.560
 the new geometry with the flatter a 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.440
 pillars and the larger front overhang 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.730
 makes the mini look sportier 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.799
 for the first time a three-cylinder comes in him 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.000

 big brother but not less 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.740
 sporty on the contrary 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.870
 The technical basis is the Audi Q5 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.790
 For the drive are two gasoline and 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.470
 a diesel ready with services like you

 what good for the xl1 can be for the up 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.220
 not be bad 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.900
 that probably also vw thought and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.220
 has the technology of the xl1 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.260
 built into the up 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.850
 came out of the twin ab 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.890
 diesel hybrid a plug in hybrid of 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.630
 purely electric 50 kilometers leads and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.040

 the roof structure of the coupÃ© everything 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.420
 glass wherever you look and under the 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.070
 hood lurks up to 495 ps we take 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.580
 a positive impression of the tokyo 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.050
 motor show 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.070
 because the industry has proven that they 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.690
 still not the end of the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.160
 flagpole has reached it are still 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.299
 many things in the pipeline and not 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.299
