reasons this is so good for athletes is

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
reasons this is so good for athletes is
the<00:00:59.850> protein<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.719> got<00:01:00.840> 9<00:01:01.079> grams<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the protein in it it's got 9 grams of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.420 
the protein in it it's got 9 grams of
protein<00:01:01.980> only<00:01:02.670> 90<00:01:03.149> calories<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.979> all

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
protein only 90 calories and it's a all

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
milk proteins way &amp; KCM way is a fast

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
milk proteins way &amp; KCM way is a fast
absorbing<00:01:08.850> protein<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.869> casein<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> slope

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
absorbing protein and casein is a slope

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
absorbing protein and casein is a slope
absorbing<00:01:11.580> protein<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> good<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
absorbing protein so get a good two to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340 
absorbing protein so get a good two to
three<00:01:14.010> hours<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.610> amino<00:01:15.360> acids<00:01:15.780> flowing<00:01:16.200> into

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
three hours of amino acids flowing into

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.570 
three hours of amino acids flowing into
your<00:01:16.530> muscles<00:01:17.040> feeding<00:01:18.030> them<00:01:18.290> repairing<00:01:19.290> them

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
your muscles feeding them repairing them

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.560 
your muscles feeding them repairing them
just<00:01:20.580> helping<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.860> any<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.250> can

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
just helping them out any way they can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
just helping them out any way they can
the<00:01:24.570> other<00:01:24.689> thing<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.369> l-glutamine

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the other thing in here is l-glutamine

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.859 
the other thing in here is l-glutamine
it's<00:01:26.549> got<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> thousand<00:01:27.180> milligrams<00:01:27.450> about

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it's got a thousand milligrams about

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's got a thousand milligrams about
glutamine<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.909> something<00:01:29.909> that's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
glutamine and this is a something that's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.600 
glutamine and this is a something that's
extremely<00:01:30.420> important<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.070> work<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.400> we

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
extremely important when we work out we

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.480 
extremely important when we work out we
lose<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:33.119> 50<00:01:33.540> percent<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
lose about 50 percent of the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.730 
lose about 50 percent of the
our<00:01:35.000> body<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:35.780> do<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.140> muscle<00:01:36.530> breakdown

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
our body just do that muscle breakdown

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.850 
our body just do that muscle breakdown
and<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:37.820> deterioration<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:39.020> need<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.649> little

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
and in deterioration so we need a little

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.859 
and in deterioration so we need a little
bit<00:01:39.979> more<00:01:40.189> when<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.490> get<00:01:41.240> done<00:01:41.450> with<00:01:41.689> our

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
bit more when we get done with our

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.990 
bit more when we get done with our
recovery<00:01:42.409> put<00:01:43.009> this<00:01:43.130> into<00:01:43.310> our<00:01:43.399> bodies<00:01:43.850> and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
recovery put this into our bodies and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.460 
recovery put this into our bodies and
then<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.330> goes<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.630> work<00:01:44.780> repairing<00:01:45.290> our

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
then it goes to work repairing our

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.380 
then it goes to work repairing our
muscles<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.159> rebuilding<00:01:46.880> them<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.240> kind

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
muscles and rebuilding them so it kind

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.940 
muscles and rebuilding them so it kind
of<00:01:47.420> works<00:01:47.630> with<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.899> protein<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.560> proteins

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
of works with the protein the proteins

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.920 
of works with the protein the proteins
like<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.250> food<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.119> l-lewd<00:01:50.420> means<00:01:50.659> kind

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
like the food and the l-lewd means kind

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.990 
like the food and the l-lewd means kind
of<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> energy<00:01:51.710> thing<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.159> puts<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.909> all

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
of the energy thing that puts it all

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.160 
of the energy thing that puts it all
together<00:01:53.119> into<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.689> muscle<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.049> best<00:01:54.289> work

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
together into the muscle and best work

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.139 
together into the muscle and best work
just<00:01:57.170> like<00:01:57.320> relaxed<00:01:58.100> regular<00:01:58.520> shake<00:01:58.700> mix<00:01:58.939> this

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
just like relaxed regular shake mix this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.910 
just like relaxed regular shake mix this
has<00:01:59.330> 20<00:01:59.720> vitamins<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.259> minerals<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:00.679> loads

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
has 20 vitamins and minerals so loads

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.770 
has 20 vitamins and minerals so loads
alcohol<00:02:01.429> those<00:02:01.580> those<00:02:02.090> things<00:02:02.330> that<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.630> need

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
alcohol those those things that you need

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.060 
alcohol those those things that you need
especially<00:02:03.020> when<00:02:03.439> you're<00:02:03.560> when<00:02:03.890> you're<00:02:03.920> an

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
especially when you're when you're an

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.490 
especially when you're when you're an
athlete<00:02:04.159> athlete's<00:02:05.049> tend<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.110> burn<00:02:06.289> through

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
athlete athlete's tend to burn through

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.609 
athlete athlete's tend to burn through
quite<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.009> bit<00:02:07.069> of<00:02:07.280> those<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.989> because<00:02:08.989> this<00:02:09.470> is

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
quite a bit of those and because this is

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.190 
quite a bit of those and because this is
for<00:02:09.769> athletes<00:02:10.150> then<00:02:11.150> boost<00:02:11.299> up<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.630> vitamin<00:02:11.989> C

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
for athletes then boost up the vitamin C

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.630 
for athletes then boost up the vitamin C
and<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.470> vitamin<00:02:12.620> D<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.069> actually<00:02:13.489> get<00:02:13.580> a

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
and the vitamin D you actually get a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520 
and the vitamin D you actually get a
hundred<00:02:13.910> percent<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.239> daily<00:02:14.569> recommended

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
hundred percent of daily recommended

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.580 
hundred percent of daily recommended
value<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:16.190> those<00:02:16.420> because<00:02:17.420> working<00:02:17.840> out<00:02:17.989> when

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
value of those because working out when

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.350 
value of those because working out when
you<00:02:18.680> break<00:02:18.890> down<00:02:18.920> your<00:02:19.130> muscles<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.850> your

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
you break down your muscles and your

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.390 
you break down your muscles and your
immune<00:02:20.600> system<00:02:21.019> gets<00:02:21.110> suppressed<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.340> you

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
immune system gets suppressed and so you

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.070 
immune system gets suppressed and so you
need<00:02:22.580> some<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.850> these<00:02:22.940> these<00:02:23.330> extra<00:02:23.660> vitamins

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
need some of these these extra vitamins

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.390 
need some of these these extra vitamins
in<00:02:24.170> there<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.410> kind<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.620> give<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:24.890> immune

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
in there to kind of give that immune

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.050 
in there to kind of give that immune
system<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.850> boost<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.299> keep<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.569> going<00:02:28.060> let's

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
system a boost and keep it going let's

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.979 
system a boost and keep it going let's
see<00:02:29.180> what<00:02:29.299> else<00:02:29.420> we<00:02:29.510> got<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:29.690> here

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
see what else we got in here

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.330 
see what else we got in here
oh<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.420> vitamin<00:02:32.420> C<00:02:32.599> vitamin<00:02:32.630> D<00:02:33.170> they<00:02:33.590> are<00:02:34.190> also

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
oh and vitamin C vitamin D they are also

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.110 
oh and vitamin C vitamin D they are also
in<00:02:34.640> there<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:35.110> antioxidants<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.120> workout

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
in there there antioxidants and workout

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.199 
in there there antioxidants and workout
when<00:02:38.810> muscles<00:02:39.079> break<00:02:39.440> down<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:40.760> create<00:02:41.030> things

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
when muscles break down we create things

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.699 
when muscles break down we create things
called<00:02:41.480> free<00:02:41.660> radicals<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.320> these<00:02:42.380> are<00:02:42.560> bad

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
called free radicals and these are bad

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.319 
called free radicals and these are bad
guys<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.100> like<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.370> run<00:02:43.579> around<00:02:43.609> our<00:02:43.970> bodies

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
guys that like to run around our bodies

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.660 
guys that like to run around our bodies
causing<00:02:44.870> problems<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:46.430> some<00:02:46.640> people

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
causing problems so you know some people

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.759 
causing problems so you know some people
believe<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.299> they<00:02:47.630> are<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.230> precursor<00:02:48.739> of

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
believe that they are the precursor of

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.860 
believe that they are the precursor of
the<00:02:48.890> cancer<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:50.209> basically<00:02:50.450> there<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.720> is

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the cancer but basically there this is

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.420 
the cancer but basically there this is
not<00:02:50.959> not<00:02:51.170> good<00:02:51.350> for<00:02:51.470> our<00:02:51.590> bodies<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.160> what<00:02:52.310> we

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
not not good for our bodies so what we

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.190 
not not good for our bodies so what we
need<00:02:52.609> is<00:02:52.640> ain't<00:02:53.000> oxidants<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.870> what<00:02:53.989> they<00:02:54.140> do

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
need is ain't oxidants and what they do

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.509 
need is ain't oxidants and what they do
is<00:02:54.410> they're<00:02:54.560> kind<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.739> like<00:02:54.829> Patman<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.400> they

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
is they're kind of like Patman as they

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.280 
is they're kind of like Patman as they
run<00:02:55.670> around<00:02:55.790> inside<00:02:56.090> our<00:02:56.299> bodies<00:02:56.690> eaten<00:02:57.049> up<00:02:57.170> to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
run around inside our bodies eaten up to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.770 
run around inside our bodies eaten up to
free<00:02:57.470> radicals<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.640> that's<00:02:59.420> where<00:02:59.570> we've

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
free radicals so that's where we've

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.840 
free radicals so that's where we've
added<00:03:00.109> in<00:03:00.410> her<00:03:00.799> blocks<00:03:01.040> headed<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.489> the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
added in her blocks headed in that the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.300 
added in her blocks headed in that the
AAA<00:03:02.030> C<00:03:02.209> D<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.750> E<00:03:02.989> make<00:03:03.829> sure<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.069> get<00:03:04.160> plenty

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
AAA C D and E make sure you get plenty

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.670 
AAA C D and E make sure you get plenty
of<00:03:04.459> antioxidants<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:05.269> get<00:03:05.390> those<00:03:05.569> white<00:03:06.500> those

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
of antioxidants to get those white those

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.660 
of antioxidants to get those white those
free<00:03:06.859> radicals<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.810> other<00:03:08.930> thing<00:03:09.109> is<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.670> this

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
free radicals the other thing is a this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.640

think<00:03:15.260> quite<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.470> few<00:03:15.530> athletes<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.730> do

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
think quite a few athletes that that do

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.690 
think quite a few athletes that that do
running<00:03:17.329> events<00:03:17.780> or<00:03:17.930> biking<00:03:18.260> events<00:03:18.700> don't
