00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.980
 meanwhile is the night 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.739
 broken in info clutter how to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.810
 it keeps the drivers aware 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.380
 does not depend on how crazy the other hand, 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.099
 to drive it is now 11 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.110
 11 o clock 12 o'clock in the night that is 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.070
 we are in the middle of the 24 hours 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.070
 from 03 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.150
 on 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.760
 Small collision at night 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.260
 dark and stretch says wet that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 you do not even see it from the cars 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.650
 and I'll fix it. I got it 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.570
 not a brake behind it massa 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.090
 Brakes as a short point with two 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.210
 hammering directed that's good can 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.340
 to get together and repair a hammer 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.320
 incredibly exhausting 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.400
 so that is very bad and on the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.470
 Track on the track are the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.119
 headlights and there are only quite 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.500
 narrow line carefully goes well 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.119
 otherwise it is so weak that you 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.550
 progresses or proves that his 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.420
 Central has seem to look better than 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.580
 babble 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.080
 be it as it is foam or 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.360
 welder in the right hands 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.110
 drive the car forward as you do 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.110
 on the basis of the two bolides caution 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.580
 spared is said we drive though 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.540
 only ten minutes that all three come 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.069
 So what do we want more 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.170
 You have to look good 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.580
 Participants cope with offers 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.319
 choose good line as I said for 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.830
 to react possibilities have as us 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.860
 continue around 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.319
 So we really have to start from the beginning 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.350
 trying to drive is the first 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.580
 short box stop because unfortunately on 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.200
 could cheer up anyway 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.490
 Ruptured are 45 hours past ten 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.800
 minutes or something then that's it 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.990
 So do not do any discussion reality 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.520
 like clockwork 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.160
 also the skoda knights rust around with the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.420
 Number 42 are about to get back in 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.420
 to climb his own
