give it to somebody to repair it for

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
give it to somebody to repair it for
yourself<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> way<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:34.020> responsible

for anyone who does this and fuck's up
their<00:00:36.510> own<00:00:36.630> controller<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:38.090> strongly

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
their own controller I strongly

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.030 
their own controller I strongly
recommend<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.920> you're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
recommend that you know what you're

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
recommend that you know what you're
doing<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.969> least<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.899> didn't<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.320> what

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
doing at least they didn't know what

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.930 
doing at least they didn't know what
you're<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.399> you've<00:00:44.550> worked<00:00:44.700> with

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you're doing or if you've worked with

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.130 
you're doing or if you've worked with
computers<00:00:45.270> before<00:00:45.390> before<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> choice

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
computers before before you choice

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
computers before before you choice
anyway<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> people<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.329> problems

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
anyway a lot of people have problems

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.250 
anyway a lot of people have problems
with<00:00:48.840> analog<00:00:49.649> sticks<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> just

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
with analog sticks so I'm going to just

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.830 
with analog sticks so I'm going to just
show<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.039> quickly<00:00:53.520> how<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.629> your

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
show you quickly how you what your

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
show you quickly how you what your
problems<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:57.180> lot<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
problems could be and a lot of the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.119 
problems could be and a lot of the
problems<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.170> people<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:59.070> think

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
problems some people have is they think

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
problems some people have is they think
that<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.730> goes<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> sticks<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that when it goes down here it sticks to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
that when it goes down here it sticks to
the<00:01:01.320> motherboard<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.660> sorry<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the motherboard and sorry about the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
the motherboard and sorry about the
shading<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:04.650> crap<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:07.820> lot<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.000> people

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
shading it's pretty crap a lot of people

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
shading it's pretty crap a lot of people
think<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.320> sticks<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> motherboard

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
think the it sticks to the motherboard

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.830 
think the it sticks to the motherboard
they<00:01:12.060> should<00:01:12.299> trim<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:14.030> lower<00:01:15.030> parts<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
they should trim the lower parts of the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
they should trim the lower parts of the
analog<00:01:16.290> thinking<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> problem

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
analog thinking that that's the problem

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.850 
analog thinking that that's the problem
the<00:01:17.939> big<00:01:18.150> problem<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> people<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the big problem a lot of people have is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
the big problem a lot of people have is
it's<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.450> mechanics<00:01:22.080> inside

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it's really just the mechanics inside

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.429 
it's really just the mechanics inside
here<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.439> become<00:01:25.439> loose<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:27.049> stiff<00:01:28.049> over

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
here that I'm become loose or stiff over

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.780 
here that I'm become loose or stiff over
time<00:01:28.829> obviously<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.340> you've<00:01:29.460> been<00:01:29.549> used

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
time obviously because you've been used

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.020 
time obviously because you've been used
moving<00:01:30.270> those<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.780> sticks<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.030> so

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
moving those on like sticks a lot and so

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390 
moving those on like sticks a lot and so
I'm<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.900> pause<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> video<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
I'm just going to pause the video and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
I'm just going to pause the video and
I'll<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.150> analogs<00:01:36.600> off<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.310> I'll

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I'll take these analogs off and I'll

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
I'll take these analogs off and I'll
show<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.500> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> click<00:01:40.680> inside

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
show you what the kind of click inside

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
show you what the kind of click inside
there<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.390> sorry<00:01:42.390> okay<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.280> analogs

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
there right sorry okay so the analogs

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.039 
there right sorry okay so the analogs
have<00:01:44.729> been<00:01:44.850> taken<00:01:45.119> off<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.390> pop<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.810> over

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
have been taken off which pop them over

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.389 
have been taken off which pop them over
here<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:48.229> okay<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.189> move

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
here over there and okay so if I move

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
here over there and okay so if I move
this<00:01:50.460> analog<00:01:51.000> stick<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.990> see

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this analog stick right here you can see

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.109 
this analog stick right here you can see
it<00:01:52.380> goes<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.159> forth<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.759> let's<00:01:54.000> say

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it goes back and forth just let's say

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.249 
it goes back and forth just let's say
you<00:01:54.180> were<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> take<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> robot

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you were to take this as a robot

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.609 
you were to take this as a robot
shoulder<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> people<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.149> they're

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
shoulder a lot of people when they're

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.749 
shoulder a lot of people when they're
trying<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> figure<00:01:58.860> out<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> problem<00:01:59.670> is

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
trying to figure out what the problem is

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.050 
trying to figure out what the problem is
with<00:01:59.909> their<00:02:00.030> analog<00:02:00.299> stick<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:01.170> actually

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
with their analog stick it's actually

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.929 
with their analog stick it's actually
just<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.740> stiffness<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
just to do with and the stiffness of the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.419 
just to do with and the stiffness of the
mechanics<00:02:06.390> inside<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.770> box<00:02:08.069> thing

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
mechanics inside this little box thing

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.960 
mechanics inside this little box thing
here<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> recommend<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.709> some<00:02:11.670> sort<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
here so what I recommend is some sort of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.860 
here so what I recommend is some sort of
lubricant<00:02:12.569> maybe<00:02:12.840> WD

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
lubricant maybe WD

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.420 
lubricant maybe WD
forty<00:02:14.200> or<00:02:14.470> any<00:02:15.400> type<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:17.129> lubricant<00:02:18.129> that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
forty or any type of lubricant that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.479 
forty or any type of lubricant that
allows<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.390> I'm<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.830> smoothing<00:02:21.159> out<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
allows you to I'm just smoothing out the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.539 
allows you to I'm just smoothing out the
analog<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.590> give<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.890> little<00:02:24.129> bit<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.459> an

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
analog and give it that little bit of an

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.839 
analog and give it that little bit of an
act<00:02:24.730> less<00:02:25.209> keep<00:02:26.200> not<00:02:26.860> not<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.190> make<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.430> sticky

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
act less keep not not to make it sticky

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.490 
act less keep not not to make it sticky
or<00:02:27.970> whatever<00:02:28.239> because<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:29.049> last<00:02:29.200> thing<00:02:29.290> we

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
or whatever because the last thing we

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.600 
or whatever because the last thing we
want<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.769> putting<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.190> controller<00:02:30.459> back

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
want is putting the controller back

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.490 
want is putting the controller back
together<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.269> thing<00:02:31.450> still<00:02:31.959> not<00:02:32.140> doing

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
together and the thing still not doing

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.619 
together and the thing still not doing
what<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.769> wanted<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.129> do<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> you'll<00:02:34.269> just<00:02:34.480> be

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
what you wanted to do and you'll just be

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.160 
what you wanted to do and you'll just be
a<00:02:34.870> waste<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.349> half<00:02:35.860> an<00:02:35.980> hour<00:02:36.129> to<00:02:36.400> an<00:02:36.489> hour<00:02:36.640> so

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
a waste of half an hour to an hour so

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.420 
a waste of half an hour to an hour so
that's<00:02:38.170> one<00:02:38.379> problem<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.860> lot<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.069> people<00:02:39.280> have

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
that's one problem a lot of people have

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's one problem a lot of people have
and<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.909> can<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.329> same<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.690> this

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and you can do it on the same with this

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.630 
and you can do it on the same with this
one<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.829> spray<00:02:42.190> spray

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
one so just get like a spray spray

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.750 
one so just get like a spray spray
around<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.959> edges<00:02:44.409> like<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.280> then

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
around the edges like that and then

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.930 
around the edges like that and then
you're<00:02:45.970> done<00:02:46.150> um<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.440> then<00:02:48.310> there's<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.700> piece

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
you're done um and then there's a piece

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.640 
you're done um and then there's a piece
of<00:02:49.150> here<00:02:49.480> we're<00:02:49.840> going<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.019> take<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.319> but

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
of here we're going to take it out but

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.130 
of here we're going to take it out but
this<00:02:51.430> bit<00:02:51.730> right<00:02:51.760> here<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.450> lot<00:02:52.629> of<00:02:52.690> people<00:02:52.870> have

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
this bit right here a lot of people have

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.410 
this bit right here a lot of people have
the<00:02:53.260> button<00:02:53.709> problems<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.370> if<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.730> press<00:02:55.090> down

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the button problems so if you press down

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.449 
the button problems so if you press down
on<00:02:55.629> the<00:02:55.750> left<00:02:56.290> analog<00:02:56.530> stick<00:02:56.739> or<00:02:57.129> right<00:02:57.310> on

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
on the left analog stick or right on

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.490 
on the left analog stick or right on
lipstick<00:02:57.910> or<00:02:58.000> whatever<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.390> fuck<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.870> don't

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
lipstick or whatever the fuck I don't

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.530 
lipstick or whatever the fuck I don't
know<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.340> one<00:03:00.609> of<00:03:00.640> those<00:03:00.819> analogs<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.420> you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
know and one of those analogs and you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.330 
know and one of those analogs and you
press<00:03:01.720> right<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.379> want<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.650> sprint<00:03:02.980> or<00:03:03.250> you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
press right so you want to sprint or you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.670 
press right so you want to sprint or you
want<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.549> shoot<00:03:03.810> same<00:03:04.810> thing<00:03:05.019> Call<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.230> Duty<00:03:05.590> or

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
want to shoot same thing Call of Duty or

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.680 
want to shoot same thing Call of Duty or
battlefield<00:03:05.709> or<00:03:06.220> something<00:03:06.400> like<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.819> lot

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
battlefield or something like that a lot

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.199 
battlefield or something like that a lot
of<00:03:07.780> people<00:03:07.989> are<00:03:08.079> wondering<00:03:08.230> why<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:09.209> buttons

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
of people are wondering why the buttons

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.849 
of people are wondering why the buttons
kind<00:03:10.599> of<00:03:10.659> spaz<00:03:10.930> out<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.379> throw<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.650> grenade

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
kind of spaz out and you throw a grenade

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.009 
kind of spaz out and you throw a grenade
or<00:03:12.220> something<00:03:12.250> it's<00:03:12.970> probably<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.690> do<00:03:13.840> with

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
or something it's probably to do with

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.569 
or something it's probably to do with
this<00:03:14.200> now<00:03:14.680> I'll<00:03:14.829> leave<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.099> link<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.519> the

description to a video which explains

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.330 
description to a video which explains
exactly<00:03:17.859> what<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.720> first<00:03:19.720> for<00:03:20.340> something

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
exactly what to do first for something

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.870 
exactly what to do first for something
like<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:23.260> bottom<00:03:23.440> line<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:24.069> you

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
like this but the bottom line is you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.150 
like this but the bottom line is you
basically<00:03:25.359> take<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:25.989> piece<00:03:26.349> of<00:03:26.500> plastic<00:03:26.709> off

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
basically take this piece of plastic off

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.650 
basically take this piece of plastic off
you<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.239> clean<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.690> off<00:03:28.870> get<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.579> get<00:03:30.579> an<00:03:30.790> ear

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
you just clean it off get a get an ear

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.150 
you just clean it off get a get an ear
cleaner<00:03:32.109> you<00:03:32.379> know<00:03:32.500> one<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.739> those<00:03:32.919> are<00:03:33.069> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
cleaner you know one of those are the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.740 
cleaner you know one of those are the
cotton<00:03:33.609> bud<00:03:33.760> things<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.389> put<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.599> your

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
cotton bud things that you put in your

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.170 
cotton bud things that you put in your
ears<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:34.989> get<00:03:35.470> one<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.680> those<00:03:35.769> rub<00:03:36.579> it<00:03:36.700> down<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
ears just get one of those rub it down a

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.379 
ears just get one of those rub it down a
lot<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.720> people<00:03:38.310> recommend<00:03:39.310> double<00:03:40.209> sided

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
lot of people recommend double sided

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.140 
lot of people recommend double sided
sticky<00:03:40.690> tape<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.379> you<00:03:41.650> lift<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.310> up<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:43.000> get

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
sticky tape so you lift this up you get

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.729 
sticky tape so you lift this up you get
the<00:03:43.329> right<00:03:43.510> measurement<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.169> double-sided

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
the right measurement of double-sided

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.339 
the right measurement of double-sided
sticky<00:03:45.040> tape<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.489> slap<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.269> down<00:03:46.299> here<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
sticky tape you slap it down here you

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.110 
sticky tape you slap it down here you
put<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.709> back<00:03:47.949> over<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.549> then<00:03:49.000> you're

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
put this back over and then you're

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.789 
put this back over and then you're
sorted<00:03:49.569> so<00:03:49.750> basically<00:03:50.079> what<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.319> does<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
sorted so basically what it does is it

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.949 
sorted so basically what it does is it
makes<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.519> registration<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.419> when<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.780> press

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
makes the registration of when you press

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.500 
makes the registration of when you press
on<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.139> button<00:03:53.220> quicker<00:03:54.220> than<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.239> was<00:03:55.329> before

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
on the button quicker than it was before

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.240 
on the button quicker than it was before
because<00:03:55.900> obviously<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.799> little<00:03:57.010> black

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
because obviously this little black

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.670 
because obviously this little black
piece<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.669> see<00:03:57.699> right<00:03:58.090> here<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:59.290> actually

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
piece you see right here it's actually

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.020 
piece you see right here it's actually
thicker<00:03:59.980> than<00:04:00.250> before<00:04:00.579> when<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.819> put<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
thicker than before when you put the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.909 
thicker than before when you put the
double-sided<00:04:01.419> sticky<00:04:01.599> tape<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:02.799> yeah

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
double-sided sticky tape and so yeah

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.409 
double-sided sticky tape and so yeah
that's<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.400> other<00:04:03.579> problem<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:04.090> people

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
that's the other problem that people

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.830 
that's the other problem that people
have<00:04:06.030> bearing<00:04:07.030> in<00:04:07.120> mind<00:04:07.150> when<00:04:07.449> you're<00:04:07.569> putting

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
have bearing in mind when you're putting

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.569 
have bearing in mind when you're putting
this<00:04:07.959> when<00:04:08.470> you're<00:04:08.590> taking<00:04:08.859> this<00:04:08.919> apart<00:04:09.280> and

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
this when you're taking this apart and

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.059 
this when you're taking this apart and
this<00:04:10.569> is<00:04:10.810> actually<00:04:11.169> in<00:04:11.379> here<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.889> this

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
this is actually in here like this

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.259 
this is actually in here like this
obviously<00:04:12.310> I'm<00:04:12.639> not<00:04:12.699> going<00:04:12.819> to<00:04:12.910> put<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.150> in

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
obviously I'm not going to put it in

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.360 
obviously I'm not going to put it in
perfectly<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:14.199> it<00:04:14.319> sits<00:04:14.530> in<00:04:14.709> like<00:04:14.829> this<00:04:15.040> and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
perfectly but it sits in like this and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.920 
perfectly but it sits in like this and
the<00:04:15.940> battery<00:04:16.680> goes<00:04:17.680> right<00:04:18.340> there<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.930> then

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
the battery goes right there and then

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.779 
the battery goes right there and then
obviously<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.650> analogs<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.340> other<00:04:21.519> side

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
obviously the analogs on the other side

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.550 
obviously the analogs on the other side
of<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.120> controller<00:04:22.690> there<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.260> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
of the controller there and the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.520 
of the controller there and the
buttons<00:04:26.370> are<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.420> as<00:04:28.110> for<00:04:28.350> this

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
buttons are like that and as for this

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.770 
buttons are like that and as for this
button<00:04:28.830> here<00:04:29.190> this<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.760> l2<00:04:30.420> button<00:04:30.450> I

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
but it's it's in just above this button

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.620 
but it's it's in just above this button
looking<00:04:51.090> thing<00:04:51.300> here

looking thing here
and<00:04:51.720> that's<00:04:52.200> what<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.440> registration<00:04:52.710> goes

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
and that's what the registration goes

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.950 
and that's what the registration goes
down<00:04:53.430> here<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:53.970> into<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> motherboard<00:04:54.780> so

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
down here and into the motherboard so

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.500 
down here and into the motherboard so
yeah<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:56.100> don't<00:04:56.280> know<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.060> helped<00:04:57.300> anybody

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
yeah I don't know if that helped anybody

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.570 
yeah I don't know if that helped anybody
I<00:04:57.960> hope<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.680> did<00:04:58.830> because<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.220> know<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.370> lot<00:04:59.460> of

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
I hope it did because I know a lot of

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.060 
I hope it did because I know a lot of
people<00:04:59.850> separate<00:05:00.360> their<00:05:00.540> videos<00:05:00.840> with<00:05:01.169> button

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
people separate their videos with button

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.120 
people separate their videos with button
problems<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.760> analog<00:05:03.150> problems<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:04.140> taking<00:05:04.980> it

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
problems to analog problems to taking it

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.220 
problems to analog problems to taking it
apart<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:05.700> I<00:05:05.730> thought<00:05:06.030> maybe<00:05:06.180> just<00:05:06.300> slapping

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
apart so I thought maybe just slapping

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.470 
apart so I thought maybe just slapping
it<00:05:07.320> all<00:05:07.440> together<00:05:07.620> maybe<00:05:08.070> one<00:05:09.000> or<00:05:09.120> two<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.360> you

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
it all together maybe one or two of you

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.850 
it all together maybe one or two of you
will<00:05:09.630> find<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.960> interesting<00:05:10.080> hopefully<00:05:10.710> more

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
will find it interesting hopefully more

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.360 
will find it interesting hopefully more
than<00:05:10.919> two<00:05:11.220> but<00:05:11.520> anyway<00:05:11.790> um<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.860> yeah<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.100> if

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
than two but anyway um so yeah and if

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.710 
than two but anyway um so yeah and if
you<00:05:14.580> really<00:05:14.820> want<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.030> get<00:05:15.120> fancy<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.660> you

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720

know what you're doing you can always

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.860 
know what you're doing you can always
get<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.280> controller<00:05:17.700> don't<00:05:18.419> worry<00:05:18.570> this<00:05:18.690> was

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
get the controller don't worry this was

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.360 
get the controller don't worry this was
already<00:05:19.020> silver<00:05:19.620> or<00:05:19.800> chrome<00:05:20.010> whatever<00:05:20.280> you

want to call it always get the

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.330 
want to call it always get the
controller<00:05:21.750> tape<00:05:22.500> up<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.890> little<00:05:23.070> pieces

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
controller tape up the little pieces

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.550 
controller tape up the little pieces
that<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.790> want<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.060> keep<00:05:24.180> safe<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.900> then
