in<00:00:28.900> NFL<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.320> mean<00:00:29.529> I<00:00:29.560> must<00:00:29.769> have<00:00:29.920> made<00:00:30.070> out<00:00:30.220> about

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
in NFL I mean I must have made out about

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.980 
in NFL I mean I must have made out about
15<00:00:30.609> different<00:00:30.910> ballots<00:00:31.449> on<00:00:31.570> this<00:00:31.720> one<00:00:31.869> because

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
15 different ballots on this one because

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.600 
15 different ballots on this one because
just<00:00:32.349> picking<00:00:32.619> this<00:00:32.740> list<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:33.340> difficult

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
just picking this list is so difficult

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.030 
just picking this list is so difficult
but<00:00:34.090> I<00:00:34.300> left<00:00:34.690> push<00:00:34.930> off<00:00:35.140> but<00:00:35.380> I<00:00:35.410> certainly<00:00:35.860> can

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
but I left push off but I certainly can

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.800 
but I left push off but I certainly can
see<00:00:36.250> why<00:00:36.430> he<00:00:36.460> would<00:00:36.730> be<00:00:36.850> in<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.090> top<00:00:37.240> five<00:00:37.570> I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
see why he would be in the top five I

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.720 
see why he would be in the top five I
mean<00:00:38.200> he's<00:00:38.440> cut<00:00:38.800> on<00:00:38.920> it<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.190> know<00:00:39.220> stop<00:00:39.550> on<00:00:39.700> a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
mean he's cut on it you know stop on a

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.550 
mean he's cut on it you know stop on a
dime<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.510> know<00:00:40.630> cut<00:00:40.870> in<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.050> open<00:00:41.320> field

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
dime you know cut in the open field

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.490 
dime you know cut in the open field
burst<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.910> hole<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.420> mean<00:00:43.600> he's<00:00:44.170> become<00:00:44.470> a

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
burst in the hole I mean he's become a

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.080 
burst in the hole I mean he's become a
stronger<00:00:44.860> player<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:45.490> think<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:45.820> one<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.030> the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
stronger player I think it's one of the

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.310 
stronger player I think it's one of the
more<00:00:46.150> underrated<00:00:46.360> things<00:00:46.780> about<00:00:47.020> him<00:00:47.200> his

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
more underrated things about him his

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.840 
more underrated things about him his
lower<00:00:47.530> body<00:00:47.770> strength<00:00:48.190> something<00:00:48.580> we<00:00:48.640> didn't

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
lower body strength something we didn't

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.640 
lower body strength something we didn't
see<00:00:48.880> a<00:00:49.000> lot<00:00:49.270> of<00:00:49.300> in<00:00:49.540> college<00:00:49.900> but<00:00:50.260> now<00:00:50.440> is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
see a lot of in college but now is

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.960 
see a lot of in college but now is
really<00:00:50.860> kind<00:00:50.950> of<00:00:51.070> rounded<00:00:51.430> his<00:00:51.550> game<00:00:51.760> he's<00:00:51.940> a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
really kind of rounded his game he's a

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.910 
really kind of rounded his game he's a
phenomenal<00:00:52.420> when<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.290> thought<00:00:53.560> about<00:00:53.620> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
phenomenal when I thought about the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.530 
phenomenal when I thought about the
