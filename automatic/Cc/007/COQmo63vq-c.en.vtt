let's let's get back to the actual pic
of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> day<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.750> its<00:01:01.590> most<00:01:01.890> likely<00:01:02.420> hinting<00:01:03.530> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
of the day I its most likely hinting to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.990 
of the day I its most likely hinting to
it<00:01:04.890> being<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.610> stage<00:01:06.350> yeah<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:08.130> thinking<00:01:08.640> it's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it being a stage yeah I'm thinking it's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
it being a stage yeah I'm thinking it's
gonna<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.270> something<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.869> lilac<00:01:10.320> cruise<00:01:10.680> or

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
gonna be something like lilac cruise or

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.929 
gonna be something like lilac cruise or
Oh<00:01:11.250> actually<00:01:11.909> no<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:13.200> maybe<00:01:13.920> maybe<00:01:14.400> corneria

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
Oh actually no I maybe maybe corneria

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
Oh actually no I maybe maybe corneria
because<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.320> maybe<00:01:16.500> you'll<00:01:16.710> be

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
because you know like maybe you'll be

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
because you know like maybe you'll be
fighting<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> side<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> ship<00:01:18.110> this
