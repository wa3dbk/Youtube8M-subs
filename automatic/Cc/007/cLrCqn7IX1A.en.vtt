00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.460

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.460
 about halloween truth 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.310
 thing that we have come up with for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.080
 decorate the house to have fun 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.080
 halloween we like to have fun 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.730
 one more word kids from the house 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.430
 we are going to need cardboard 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.400
 a pencil 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.400
 a pair of scissors was already sleeping 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.430
 We started with adhesive tape 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.560
 a spit the plaster and we put it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 as if it were a mummy worth 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.040
 we will cover it so look 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.040
 well you see it good 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.860
 do not respond as if it's worth 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.180
 well let's go to cut 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 It seems 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.900
 simple but it does not work so much more 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.900
 kids 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 another craft this is the one that most 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.330
 like me 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.600
 we need important 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.810
 guess socks stripes 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.280
 divine 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.760
 we guess we guess a roll of paper 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.750
 Guess let's live masters and ones 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.230
 red shoes to see what this sounds like 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.230
 or 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.410
 let's make the witch piruja the 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.470
 wood 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.090
 and we have used some shoes 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.090
 archery jimena 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.120
 who loves heels 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.159
 truly 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.159
 place them 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:07.140
 let's start to see the first one that 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.280
 it is very basic black in the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.010
 craft now will do 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.480
 any truth that can prove 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.600
 fixed and has a color label of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.260
 silver or white clarito its defect to 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.260
 for the windows that yes 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.989

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.989
 and we started 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.319
 well, we're a little clumsy with the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.760
 We thought to paint pumpkins 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.760
 Black and write 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.620
