00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.670 
or Kasparov and Karpov and the chess
tournament<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.929> mean<00:02:11.049> I<00:02:11.170> think<00:02:11.200> it's<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.530> lot

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

tournament I mean I think it's a lot
like<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.400> me<00:02:12.519> because<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.940> very

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
like that to me because it's a very

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.910 
like that to me because it's a very
sophisticated<00:02:13.450> game<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.319> operates<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
sophisticated game that operates on a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.069 
sophisticated game that operates on a
lot<00:02:15.099> of<00:02:15.220> levels<00:02:15.400> both<00:02:15.840> sort<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.900> mathematical

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
lot of levels both sort of mathematical

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.229 
lot of levels both sort of mathematical
and<00:02:17.920> then<00:02:18.099> strategic<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.150> then

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
and then strategic and then

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.120 
and then strategic and then
psychological<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.709> you're<00:02:20.860> playing

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
psychological and when you're playing

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.640 
psychological and when you're playing
