00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550 

so<00:00:00.840> if<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.079> compare<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:02.010> nikon<00:00:02.550> d90<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.560> canon

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
so if we compare the nikon d90 the canon

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.120 
so if we compare the nikon d90 the canon
7d<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.899> the<00:00:06.899> panasonic<00:00:07.890> dvx<00:00:08.250> 100<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.540> may<00:00:09.750> say

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
7d and the panasonic dvx 100 you may say

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.629 
7d and the panasonic dvx 100 you may say
why<00:00:11.130> are<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.580> why<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.240> serving<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.780> well

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
why are we why are we serving that well

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.369 
why are we why are we serving that well
there's<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.759> reason<00:00:15.179> they're<00:00:15.839> all<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
there's a reason they're all about the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.599 
there's a reason they're all about the
same<00:00:16.619> price<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:18.920> they<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.369> 2014<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:22.609> you

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
same price and they all do 2014 so you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.870 
same price and they all do 2014 so you
know<00:00:23.730> obviously<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> 70s<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> look<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
know obviously the 70s going to look the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.349 
know obviously the 70s going to look the
best<00:00:27.260> but<00:00:28.490> what<00:00:29.490> about<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> other<00:00:29.939> cameras

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
best but what about the other cameras

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.370 
best but what about the other cameras
where<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:30.869> fit<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.899> what<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.170> say

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
where do they fit in and what can we say

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.069 
where do they fit in and what can we say
about<00:00:34.410> those<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.090> take<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
about those so if we take a look at the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.270 
about those so if we take a look at the
the<00:00:37.440> actual<00:00:38.270> video<00:00:39.469> we<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> still<00:00:41.040> frame

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the actual video we have a still frame

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
the actual video we have a still frame
that<00:00:41.520> shows<00:00:41.760> some<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:42.680> different

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that shows some very different

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700 
that shows some very different
attributes<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.430> each<00:00:44.579> camera<00:00:45.260> for<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> dbx

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
attributes for each camera for the dbx

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
attributes for each camera for the dbx
100<00:00:47.190> receiving<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.789> has<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> very<00:00:48.300> very

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
100 receiving it has a very very

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
100 receiving it has a very very
different<00:00:48.899> color<00:00:49.379> ama<00:00:49.620> tree<00:00:49.920> than<00:00:50.190> both<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
different color ama tree than both the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.340 
different color ama tree than both the
other<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.300> cameras<00:00:53.270> its<00:00:54.270> resolution<00:00:54.690> isn't

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
other two cameras its resolution isn't

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.250 
other two cameras its resolution isn't
the<00:00:55.680> greatest<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.449> does<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.960> less

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the greatest but it does have less

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.970 
the greatest but it does have less
artifacts<00:00:58.890> than<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.910> d90<00:01:00.440> now<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
artifacts than the d90 now when we go to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.000 
artifacts than the d90 now when we go to
the<00:01:02.280> d90<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> everything<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the d90 we see that everything in the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
the d90 we see that everything in the
video<00:01:05.250> mode<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.729> abnormally<00:01:06.630> crushed<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
video mode is abnormally crushed the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.679 
video mode is abnormally crushed the
blacks<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.830> crushed<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
blacks are crushed now this is what the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
blacks are crushed now this is what the
contrast<00:01:11.150> turned<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:13.400> obviously<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.580> had

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
contrast turned down obviously if we had

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
contrast turned down obviously if we had
more<00:01:14.909> controls<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> pitcher<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.380> might

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
more controls over the pitcher we might

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
more controls over the pitcher we might
be<00:01:16.770> able<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> look<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.180> bit

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
be able to make it look a little bit

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.330 
be able to make it look a little bit
better<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.670> remarkably<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> color<00:01:21.509> between

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
better but remarkably the color between

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.620 
better but remarkably the color between
the<00:01:23.340> d90<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.119> 70<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.170> very<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.009> close<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.119> 70

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the d90 and 70 is very very close the 70

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.760 
the d90 and 70 is very very close the 70
is<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.700> well<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> lot<00:01:30.210> sharper<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.530> also

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is a well it's a lot sharper and it also

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
is a well it's a lot sharper and it also
has<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.700> dynamic<00:01:33.240> range<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:34.229> I've<00:01:34.439> adjusted

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
has more dynamic range now I've adjusted

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.330 
has more dynamic range now I've adjusted
and<00:01:35.250> tweak<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.790> contrast<00:01:36.090> ratio<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> 70

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and tweak the contrast ratio of the 70

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
and tweak the contrast ratio of the 70
that<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.670> first<00:01:38.909> thing<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> did<00:01:39.450> we'll<00:01:40.290> go

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that was first thing that I did we'll go

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
that was first thing that I did we'll go
over<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> tutorial<00:01:41.340> videos

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
over that in one of the tutorial videos

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.399 
over that in one of the tutorial videos
but<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> picks<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
but you see that it picks up more of the

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.700 
but you see that it picks up more of the
background<00:01:46.409> black<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:48.119> also<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:49.409> picks

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
background black and it also just picks

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
background black and it also just picks
up<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:50.040> inch<00:01:50.250> throughout<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> picture

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
up more inch throughout the picture

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.340 
up more inch throughout the picture
whereas<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.390> d90<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.320> crushed<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:54.270> dvx<00:01:54.810> 100

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
whereas the d90 is crushed the dvx 100

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340 
whereas the d90 is crushed the dvx 100
definitely<00:01:56.310> shows<00:01:56.549> some<00:01:57.229> aberration<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
definitely shows some aberration and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.350 
definitely shows some aberration and
that<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.829> comes<00:01:59.070> from<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> lens<00:02:00.060> that's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that just comes from the lens that's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.330 
that just comes from the lens that's
used<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.350> mean<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.250> great

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
used with it I mean it's a great

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.990 
used with it I mean it's a great
standard<00:02:03.969> def<00:02:04.179> camera<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.310> never<00:02:06.609> did

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
standard def camera but it never did

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.109 
standard def camera but it never did
well<00:02:07.270> high<00:02:07.990> contrast<00:02:08.590> edges<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.459> there's<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
well high contrast edges so there's a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.660 
well high contrast edges so there's a
lot<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.410> still<00:02:11.739> frame<00:02:12.040> so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
lot of that and this is still frame so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.699 
lot of that and this is still frame so
that's<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:13.330> video<00:02:13.510> will<00:02:14.290> definitely

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
that's it for this video will definitely

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.920 
that's it for this video will definitely
be<00:02:14.800> doing<00:02:14.950> more<00:02:15.370> tests<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> future<00:02:16.420> but<00:02:16.660> I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
be doing more tests in the future but I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.509 
be doing more tests in the future but I
just<00:02:17.230> want<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.530> get<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.769> quick<00:02:18.040> test<00:02:18.310> out

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
just want to get this quick test out

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.000 
just want to get this quick test out
there<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.300> see<00:02:19.830> arrange<00:02:20.830> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
there so that you can see arrange a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.720 
there so that you can see arrange a
