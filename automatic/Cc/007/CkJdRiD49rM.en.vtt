00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.130 
but I think the board will be a much
better<00:03:00.160> way<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.000> explaining<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.959> and

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
better way of explaining it to you and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.370 
better way of explaining it to you and
we'll<00:03:02.799> be<00:03:02.920> using<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.250> extensively<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.380> the
