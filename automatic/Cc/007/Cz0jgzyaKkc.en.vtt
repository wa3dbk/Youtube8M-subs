 valentine in the romantic tours so 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.070
 I come involved a lip balm and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.260
 a base for the face that is a base 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.269
 from nars who really gives 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.039
 glowy bright but really very 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 natural and I really like this base 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.820
 so then I come involved my bottom 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 complexion which is the vital aqua of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 at chanel with the chedjou paintbrush 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.270
 lee hsiu it's the number 5 116 and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 apply it to just matter 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.000
 perfectly 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 then I come and hide my dark circles 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 with the anti-dark circles of shepard which is the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.120
 maracuja which is very strong stake 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 really like it and the brush 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.520
 f-86 it's really my new favorite 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.649
 for lentils firm 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.000
 it's amazing so then I come 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.320
 powder and all so it's a powder 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 from yves saint laurent who and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.270
 matifying not perfectly mattifying 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 but what I need is for 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.320
 Guaranteed light effect then we pass 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 by the sun step with my powder 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 tart bronzer that is really 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.950
 beautiful was really bright 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 amazing and I just apply it with 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.539
 a f 25.2 at sigma I present to you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 coralis pile of beneficial home who is a 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.319
 peach bluff that warms the complexion that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.359
 immediately gives good looks and I 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.950
 come and finish with a highlighter from home 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.560
 mac that unfortunately was a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.939
 limited edition but no matter kleiter 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.979
 I think it's really important 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.569
 to give a luminous effect indeed 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.270
 a little jersey I think you see this 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.349
 that I mean 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.789
 after applying a base to 

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.859
 eyelids I come to take the lighthouse 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.219
 limit I just click to quad 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.219
 banking 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.250
 then with an e 55 I come to take the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.810
 lighthouse tricks and walked on august that I come 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.760
 applied at the level of the eyelid 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.280
 mobile really to catch the light 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.630
 at this level there and internal corner with 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.640
 a little brush I'm going to come to 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.590
 apply the ghost lighthouse really for 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.380
 enlarge the look is again 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.000
 caught the light at that level with 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.070
 a small brush boulin brushes pencils 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.560
 who is the boss of at sigma I come 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.780
 take the darkseid lighthouse that I come to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.820
 apply to the outer corner of my eye 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.100
 first of all by forming a kind of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.170
 line vermont eyebrows to the tip of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.010
 my concern is actually I close by the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.660
 result in a triangle 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.000
 and I 'm going crazy tea with a bath 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.750
 his profit and with that you have a big 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.560
 guys 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.560
 insured 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.440
 do not hesitate to stretch the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.440
 matter for an effect in may 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.030
 then we would come save with a corner 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.190
 and amplifies the frame from Sigma 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.540
 Then I come to take the lighthouse link 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.090
 once again but this time 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.490
 could save the edges half this side 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.770
 smoked really very clean so I just 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.120
 blur the edge is also the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.120
 ends of the eyes 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.400
 and for an intense effort we will come 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.080
 take the lighthouse black rot from the pallet 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.940
 which the darkest lighthouse we are going 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.920
 come applied with a little 30 for more 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.379
 details and then we'll apply it to 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.099
 outer corner of the eye and overall signed 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.870
 with iraq he lower eyes and 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.060
 with this step we really 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.720
 the impression of drawn the look at 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.720
 maximum 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.250
 for a little more light I come 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.980
 apply the buzz lighthouse at the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.049
 lower root but just in the middle nor 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.180
 in that externally nor internal jobs 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.000
 for indeed really catches light 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.220
 a slightly more velvety effect 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.349
 I want to tell you with the wine of 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.810
 at sigma which is just perfect for that 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.730
 to keep this romantic effect I you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.099
 advise to put aside your gel 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.260
 liner your liquid eyeliner but 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.030
 rather applied a black pencil this one 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.470
 it's a pencil from smashbox that I 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.690
 come involved roughly at the level 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.220
 of the higher rating and that I come 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.310
 faded afterwards with a little 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.950
 brush such as wine from sigma 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.349
 place one curls eyelashes the step that me 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.280
 flipper but I assure you we 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.590
 see the difference 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.900
 then the mascara stage so this time 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.970
 This flex divers in smashbox 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.670
 which is really not bad but 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.440
 nothing do you fossils for the saint

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.280
 guarantee 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.320
 then we go to the lips we go 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.209
 try to recoil pedneault lips the 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.830
 more naturally possible we will try 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.930
 to cheat without anyone sees too much 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.550
