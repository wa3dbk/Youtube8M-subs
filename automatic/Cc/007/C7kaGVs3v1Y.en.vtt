performance with the new MacBook Pro we

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.960 
performance with the new MacBook Pro we
set<00:05:14.810> out<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.410> design<00:05:15.889> something<00:05:16.490> extreme

set out to design something extreme
and<00:05:18.600> this<00:05:18.870> led<00:05:19.170> us<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.920> rethink<00:05:20.100> everything

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
and this led us to rethink everything

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.390 
and this led us to rethink everything
about<00:05:21.480> our<00:05:21.690> process<00:05:22.260> everything<00:05:23.040> about

about our process everything about

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.140 
about our process everything about
what's<00:05:23.610> essential<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.600> a<00:05:24.630> notebook<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.880> that

what's essential to a notebook and that

what's essential to a notebook and that
meant<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:28.140> we<00:05:28.290> could<00:05:28.470> design<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.980> very<00:05:29.340> best

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
meant that we could design the very best
