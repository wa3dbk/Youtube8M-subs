00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.207
 Yes, we are having a great time, there are some huge beaches ... 

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:11.711
 - Ah! Ah, Dani! - Yes, but she has fallen asleep and look how she has burned 

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.213
 Yes, leave me 

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.549
 Burned are we who left us at the foot of the altar 

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.551
 Go, we've already explained, it was a hoot 

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:23.223
 Ei, I bought a bikini and a handkerchief and I put a pineapple on my head and Carmen Miranda total 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.058
 Yes, clavadita 

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.562
 - Hey, have you already gone to feed Tortugo? - Yes Yes Yes 

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.198
 - And a little water for the plants? - Yes 

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.702
 Very good, nice thanks! Well, nothing, a little kiss. 

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.706
 - See you soon, have a good time - Goodbye ... Goodbye ... Goodbye 

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.209
 Cruz, your comment was too much 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.014
 Sorry, but the normal thing is that if you decide not to marry, you think about it before 

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.050
 And so much, with the pasta that the costumes cost us 

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:54.888
 It is the same whether they have married or not married, they are well together, right? Well, that's what counts 

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.524
 Yes? Well, I, Arlet, have not seen her too animated 

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.892
 It must be by jet lag 

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.894
 Nena, who have gone to Lanzarote 

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.996
 It is that this hour less dislodges a lot 

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.967
 Be as it is here we are not here to launch rockets either 

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.872
 Lidia and finally Toni, did he tell you why he did not come to the wedding? 

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:16.042
 Yes he had a problem at work 

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.678
 Good that? See you tomorrow at the pool? 

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.714
 Well, I was going to go, but to unsubscribe 

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.882
 What do you say? 

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.886
 Yes, no, do not look at me like that, it's that I have to cut expenses. 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.559
 I do not have a job and with unemployment I do not arrive, the children, the house, the car and I start to study that also costs a paste! 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.730
 That you have put back is a fantastic idea .. but, the pool? The pool is sacred! 

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.865
 - Of course - Absolutely 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.034
 We'll see how we do it 

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.969
 Yes, we'll see, we'll see many thanks 

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.539
 If we do not see each other there, we'll see each other at Claudia's birthday party. 

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.642
 Oh, it's true! I want to buy the cake 

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.745
 No, the cake is my thing, I'll make a recipe from my mother 

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.415
 Well then, please let me buy the candle 

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:59.886
 Very well. Are we organized to go watering the Arlet plants? 

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.054
 Yes 

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:05.091
 I worry Paula, a lot. I see it so off-center ... 

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.093
 Leave therapy too soon 

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.695
 I do not think it's a matter of therapy 

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.564
 Let's see if in the operation they touched something that did not touch ... 

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:12.332
 Joana ... 

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.933
 What? Sometimes happens 

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.870
 Some people come in for a foot operation and come out with some tits 

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.371
 If every day! 

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.240
 Hey, go, go, seriously 

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.676
 - It's not the usual Paula - No, this is worse 

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:25.545
 It's mine 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.414
 And what about the work? 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.551
 I'll try to hold on until I find another 

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:34.053
 - And the children, how do they wear it? - Good good good 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.891
 - Toni, it's heavier! - Lucky! 

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.563
 Hey, Arlet, it's connected! 

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.470
 - Hello! - Hello girls! 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.705
 - Hello! - How are you? 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.040
 Good, and you? 

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.309
 Well, look here, taking advantage to criticize 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.545
 Manguis, you are some manguis 

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.379
 And Dani? 

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.981
 All right. It's gone down, there's a party here at the hotel 

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:02.982
 And you? 

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.385
 No, I stayed here. I do not know, I was lazy 

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.688
 And that? Explain things to me 

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.090
 - That's you, you're on your honeymoon. - De miel y matÃ³ (typical Catalan dessert) 

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.560
 - What? - Nothing nothing... 

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:19.232
 Well, listen, here, apart from the fact that tomorrow is Claudia's birthday 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.701
 Yes, I know. We will give you the gift when we return, eh? 

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.902
 Quiet 

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.971
 And how have you seen "Tortugo"? 

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.273
 - Oh, very lively - Like you! 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.211
 - We've watered the plants! - Oh perfect 

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.947
 But for the "dry law" cactus, uh, that the water is going to be fatal 

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.382
 - Yes ah 

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.085
 And when do they give it to you? 

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.687
 We do not know yet 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.355
 How good Lidia! 

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:47.760
 First we will stay to snack to see if we understand each other, but without forcing anything, huh 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.795
 and if everything goes well ... 

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:49.963
 Well of course it will go well 

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.065
 Toni and you will be fathers 

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.733
 take, you want to try? 

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:58.037
 No, no, I do not need to do these practices. Manu is 13 years old 

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.707
 Caramba! It's grown up, but maybe better 

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.542
 I do not know, I'll tell you ... 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.613
 What? What do we do with the claus (keys) of Lidia? 

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:09.549
 Claus, clau? What is the diminutive? (the baby's name is Claudia) 

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.885
 - No, it's a family anecdote. - Ah ... 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.156
 Take, all yours. Epa! 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.797
 - eh ... - Hello Joana. And children? 

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.367
 We have met someone unexpected at the door 

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.702
 What do you want? This, this, this ... 

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:36.042
 - Hello! - Happy birthday bug! 

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.043
 Hello, girls! 

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:39.045
 Hey! But what do you do here? What has happened? 

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.714
 We could not miss Claudia's birthday, we came straight from the airport 

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:43.783
 Have you seen that friends have mom, Claudia? 

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.818
 There are priority things eh precious? 

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:46.886
 And Dani? 

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:49.555
 He has been freaking out with your cactus collection! 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.226
 - What happens? - Nothing, nothing, nothing 

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.230
 - Well, we're all here - And Paula? 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.399
 No, we are already all 

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:03.770
 I go out for a moment to look for a candle, it can not be that on his first birthday he does not even have a candle 

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.371
 Cruz, now everything will be closed 

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.974
 - No, it's still early - No, you go with the Canary timetable 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.379
 - What Dani? You like them? - Yes, I'm passionate 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.048
 Well, we bought these 

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:18.051
 Look, look what obsession has caught Claudia with the puppy 

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:22.989
 I got it! Claudia can already blow the candle! Thank you 

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.563
 Who brought this dog? 

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.832
 A messenger. But he has not told me from whom 

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.033
 I do not need that 

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.036
 Uuu, a secret admirer, eh triumphant? 

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.738
 And if we open the cellar? 

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.214
 - Paula! - Thank you 

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.951
 - Hello - Sorry for being late 

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.256
 - Come, have! A drink, drink for the girl - I do not think I need it 

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.960
 Where is the cake, huh? 

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.230
 No need, you already have a candle, you do not need Paula 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.202
 The candle was for her 

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.036
 Paula, please 

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:15.541
 Queee? The candle, I want the fucking candle to blow 

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.247
 What is it? 

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:43.035
 Happy birthday, happy birthday, we wish you Claudia, happy birthday 

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:10.563
 Like home anywhere, huh?
