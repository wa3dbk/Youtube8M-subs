accessibilities<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.330> noticed<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.689> hard<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> see

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
accessibilities I noticed is hard to see

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580 
accessibilities I noticed is hard to see
and<00:01:13.640> then<00:01:14.640> turn<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:14.939> inverted<00:01:15.930> colors<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and then turn on inverted colors and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.969 
and then turn on inverted colors and
when<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.860> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
when I do this you actually can see it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.340 
when I do this you actually can see it
better<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.180> rest<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.780> funky<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
better but the rest was going funky so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.039 
better but the rest was going funky so
let's<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.680> back<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.540> turn<00:01:24.540> them<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.780> off

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
let's go back in here turn them back off

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.140 
let's go back in here turn them back off
and<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.850> toggle

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and now you can see a little toggle

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.270 
and now you can see a little toggle
right<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> inverted<00:01:28.290> colors<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
right there is inverted colors so you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
right there is inverted colors so you
can<00:01:29.460> turn<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.790> varied<00:01:30.150> colors<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.140> off

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
can turn in varied colors on and off

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
can turn in varied colors on and off
very<00:01:31.560> easily<00:01:31.740> there's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> couple<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
very easily there's a couple more of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.390 
very easily there's a couple more of
them<00:01:32.970> hidden<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> settings<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.439> that's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
them hidden in settings but that's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
them hidden in settings but that's
basically<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
basically what you can do and how you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.700 
basically what you can do and how you
can<00:01:37.590> turn<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.159> different<00:01:39.090> titles<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:40.049> add<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
can turn on different titles to add to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
can turn on different titles to add to
your<00:01:40.740> notification<00:01:41.729> drop<00:01:41.909> down<00:01:42.150> here<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
your notification drop down here so it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.569 
your notification drop down here so it's
pretty<00:01:43.500> much<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> difference<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.280> with

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
pretty much the difference here with

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.420 
pretty much the difference here with
android<00:01:44.909> 5.1<00:01:45.470> some<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> other<00:01:46.890> changes

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
android 5.1 some of the other changes

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.850 
android 5.1 some of the other changes
are<00:01:47.729> things<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.740> into

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
are things like this so if you go into

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.710 
are things like this so if you go into
your<00:01:50.009> clock<00:01:50.490> i'm<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> show<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.570> these

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
your clock i'm going to show you these

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
your clock i'm going to show you these

6<00:03:38.750> like<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.020> all<00:03:39.140> know<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.590> then<00:03:40.220> before

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
6 like you all know and then before

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.310 
6 like you all know and then before
you're<00:03:41.420> going<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.630> see<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.840> think<00:03:42.050> you're

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
you're going to see I think you're

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.810 
you're going to see I think you're
having<00:03:42.440> you're<00:03:42.740> not<00:03:42.890> even<00:03:43.100> going<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.280> see<00:03:43.490> much

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
having you're not even going to see much

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.400 
having you're not even going to see much
of<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:44.090> boot<00:03:44.270> animation<00:03:44.810> all<00:03:45.020> right<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.350> is

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
of a boot animation all right so it is

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.630 
of a boot animation all right so it is
going<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.680> show<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.920> little<00:03:46.100> bit<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.430> one

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
going to show you a little bit of one

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.020 
going to show you a little bit of one
and<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.890> think<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.340> what<00:03:49.580> might<00:03:49.880> go

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
and I think it like what might go

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.970 
and I think it like what might go
through<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.570> little<00:03:50.810> android<00:03:51.320> finish<00:03:51.830> the

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
through the little android finish the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.680 
through the little android finish the
booty<00:03:52.130> animation<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.090> before<00:03:53.390> anything<00:03:53.630> else

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
booty animation and before anything else

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
booty animation and before anything else
comes<00:03:53.990> up<00:03:54.230> it's<00:03:54.470> going<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.680> go<00:03:54.770> directly<00:03:55.010> to

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
comes up it's going to go directly to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.730 
comes up it's going to go directly to
lock<00:03:55.459> screen<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:57.380> let's<00:03:57.740> see<00:03:57.920> if<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.100> does<00:03:58.280> it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
lock screen so let's see if it does it

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.080 
lock screen so let's see if it does it
there<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.920> go<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.520> you<00:04:01.580> can<00:04:01.640> see<00:04:01.880> no

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.170 
then when it boots it will fully load up
and<00:04:20.419> work<00:04:21.140> so<00:04:21.859> that's<00:04:22.610> what<00:04:22.790> I'm<00:04:22.880> talking

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
security before the device even boots so

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.980 
security before the device even boots so

the phone for them to access there we go

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.970
