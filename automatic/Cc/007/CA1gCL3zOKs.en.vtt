you'll<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.369> started<00:00:33.230> when

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you'll need to get started when

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
you'll need to get started when
selecting<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> paper<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.730> don't<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.210> to
