00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
out and it just looks so beautiful and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.570 
out and it just looks so beautiful and
natural<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.260> complementary<00:03:38.890> it's<00:03:39.310> enough

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
natural and complementary it's enough

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.520 
natural and complementary it's enough
just<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> get<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.300> there<00:03:40.540> emphasize<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.320> lash

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
just to get in there emphasize the lash

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.680 
just to get in there emphasize the lash
line<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.310> then<00:03:42.459> smudge<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.030> enough<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.540> it's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
line and then smudge it enough that it's

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.509 
line and then smudge it enough that it's
appropriate<00:03:43.900> for<00:03:44.260> day<00:03:44.590> but<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.100> think<00:03:45.459> you

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
appropriate for day but I think you

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.890 
appropriate for day but I think you
could<00:03:45.670> probably<00:03:45.730> even<00:03:46.060> use<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.480> into<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
could probably even use this into the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.750 
could probably even use this into the
night<00:03:47.080> oh<00:03:47.320> yeah<00:03:47.890> I'm<00:03:48.160> not<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.340> little<00:03:48.610> more

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
night oh yeah I'm not a little more

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.790 
night oh yeah I'm not a little more
heavily<00:03:49.060> in<00:03:49.180> will<00:03:49.570> nudge<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.930> up<00:03:50.050> exactly<00:03:50.709> and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
heavily in will nudge it up exactly and

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.350 
heavily in will nudge it up exactly and
you<00:03:50.920> know<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.250> we're<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:51.459> even<00:03:51.640> working<00:03:52.030> with

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
the bottom lash line go ahead and look

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.220

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
look just look forward you can see that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.759 
look just look forward you can see that
if<00:04:00.519> we<00:04:00.700> actually<00:04:00.940> did<00:04:01.570> put<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:01.989> in<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.560> lash

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
if we actually did put that in the lash

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.920 
if we actually did put that in the lash
line<00:04:02.800> or<00:04:03.190> in<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.489> water<00:04:03.700> line<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.480> get

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
line or in the water line and and get
