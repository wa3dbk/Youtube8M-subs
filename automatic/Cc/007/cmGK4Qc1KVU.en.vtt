00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the blog and if I go to setup that it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
the blog and if I go to setup that it
should<00:00:57.210> run<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.780> well<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.649> install

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
should run as well but it will install

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:11.760 
should run as well but it will install
it<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.879> watch<00:01:00.320> setup

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.730 

so<00:01:12.369> it's<00:01:12.520> just<00:01:12.640> verifying<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:16.290> yes<00:01:17.290> I<00:01:17.530> want

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:36.270 
so it's just verifying that yes I want
to<00:01:17.799> install

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.510 

now<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.260> want<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.590> run<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.400> even

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
now if you want to run it you can even

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.060 
now if you want to run it you can even
