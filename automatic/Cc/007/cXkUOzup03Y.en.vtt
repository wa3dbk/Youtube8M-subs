00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.940
 and how about friends welcome 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.310
 once again the channel let follow 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.380
 Yours tutorials to your server Jose 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.110
 Guadeloupe Garcia and this time we are going 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.700
 to learn how to use a usb memory 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.220
 or any device 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.040
 storage to use it as a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 ram memory good for those who do not 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.030
 know there is a pretty technique 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.179
 interesting by which we can 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.489
 allocate more ram memory so to speak 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.879
 to our computer using 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.499
 only a usb memory and although not 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.260
 it is as efficient as they will be added 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.780
 we will add a new memory module 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.690
 ram can be of great help in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 some cases we will do this with 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.760
 help from a windows service called 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.399
 readyboost in which we can assign 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.729
 ram to our computer using 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.280
 only one usb memory one card 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.570
 microsd or any device 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 storage 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.240
 except for the ssd disks since 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 they are not fast enough and I do not know 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.130
 would benefit with the network process and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.920
 boost the idea of ​​the matter is to assign 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 space on the removable device like 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.869
 Exchange space or virtual memory 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.790
 task that the disk normally has 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.490
 hard but considering that the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.070
 flash memory are much faster and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.310
 therefore we will get a better 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.619
 good performance that we will need to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.170
 this is basically going to need 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.300
 only a usb memory or any 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.910
 storage device and that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.539
 have to have at least one space 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.210
 a giga that has at least one free giga 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.300
 in my case I have here in my 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.540
 computer inserted a memory of 16 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.730
 gb and I have 13 gigs available 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.920
 Well the first step to do this 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.640
 is to select the memory to which 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 let's assign the virtual space we're going 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.080
 to right click on the memory and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.080
 let's go to where it says properties 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.519
 and in this window we're going to go to the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 tab that says readyboost and here we 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.849
 these options will appear good what 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 we must do is click here in the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.129
 box that says use this device and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.900
 here where it says reserved space for 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.480
 the speed of the system are going to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.450
 select the amount of memory of the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.120
 of the flash memory that they will want 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.299
 use 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.819
 to use it as ram memory is 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.510
 advisable to use not all 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.610
 amount not all the amount of space 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.959
 but if at least the most possible 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.959
 in my case I will select 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 3 gb 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.750
 13 gigabyte 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.010
 and once selected they will have to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.700
 click where it says apply 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.079
 and we wait for it to be configured and accept 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.750
 It is worth mentioning that the space 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.610
 assigned may not be used so 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.330
 which will reduce that space in the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.550
 memory 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.340
 and ready here will be what is the file 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.620
 ready bus do not have to delete it and already 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.510
 will be on your computer set going 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.690
 to use this memory as memory 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.670
 flash or ram and good memory if they wanted 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.350
 remove or delete what is the function 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.110
 of the readyboost will do the same 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.930
 let's select the memory to which 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.850
 we assign the ready boost that they will 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.790
 Right click properties 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.800
 readyboost and they are going to click here on the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.050
 box where it says do not use this 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.700
 device we're going to click where 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.440
 says apply and accept and good guys 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.420
 this has been all the video today I hope 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.760
 you liked it and I hope it's from 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.710
 great utility as always I remember

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.140
 of course good guys without anything else 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.650
 what to say see you in the next video 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.650
