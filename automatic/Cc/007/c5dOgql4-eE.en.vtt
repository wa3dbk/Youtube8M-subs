00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.390 
then we're going to leave 10 minutes but
we're<00:02:14.020> going<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.170> add<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.320> delay<00:02:14.709> here<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.250> can

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
we're going to add a delay here you can

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.280 
we're going to add a delay here you can
add<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> delay<00:02:15.910> anywhere<00:02:16.300> from<00:02:16.420> zero<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.870> 60

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
add a delay anywhere from zero to 60

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.400 
add a delay anywhere from zero to 60
seconds<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.880> case<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.350> to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
seconds so in this case we're going to

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.250 
seconds so in this case we're going to
add<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.590> five-second<00:02:21.280> delay<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:23.140> also

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
add a five-second delay now you can also

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
add a five-second delay now you can also
add<00:02:23.530> an<00:02:23.739> increment<00:02:24.160> or<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:25.000> could<00:02:25.150> use<00:02:25.299> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
add an increment or you could use the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.970 
add an increment or you could use the
increment<00:02:25.630> time<00:02:25.959> instead<00:02:26.410> we're<00:02:26.680> not<00:02:26.799> going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
increment time instead we're not going

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.520 
increment time instead we're not going
to<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.570> tournament<00:02:29.380> modes

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to do that this is the tournament modes

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.890 
to do that this is the tournament modes
we'll<00:02:29.799> talk<00:02:29.950> about<00:02:30.070> those<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.549> minute

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we'll talk about those in a minute

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.350 
we'll talk about those in a minute

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
going to reset it go back into the timey

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.580 
going to reset it go back into the timey
mode<00:03:13.210> yeah<00:03:14.210> now<00:03:14.870> we're<00:03:15.020> going<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.200> skip<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.560> the

mode yeah now we're going to skip to the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.830 
mode yeah now we're going to skip to the
tournament<00:03:16.100> mode<00:03:16.280> let's<00:03:16.940> turn<00:03:17.150> our<00:03:17.300> delay<00:03:17.600> off

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
tournament mode let's turn our delay off

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.330 
tournament mode let's turn our delay off
first<00:03:22.210> okay<00:03:23.210> so<00:03:23.420> here's<00:03:23.930> our<00:03:24.050> first<00:03:24.350> timing

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
first okay so here's our first timing

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.710 
first okay so here's our first timing
controller<00:03:25.760> time<00:03:26.060> control<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:26.600> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
controller time control in the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.240 
controller time control in the
tournament<00:03:27.110> mode<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.980> we're<00:03:28.100> going<00:03:28.190> to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
tournament mode and so we're going to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.470 
tournament mode and so we're going to
get<00:03:28.370> into<00:03:28.610> there<00:03:28.820> we're<00:03:29.030> going<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.209> set<00:03:29.360> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
get into there we're going to set the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.670 
get into there we're going to set the
number<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> moves<00:03:30.730> for<00:03:31.730> T<00:03:31.820> moves<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:35.500> let's<00:03:36.500> do

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
number of moves for T moves in let's do

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.100 
number of moves for T moves in let's do
an<00:03:36.800> hour<00:03:37.900> okay

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
an hour okay

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.110 
an hour okay
for<00:03:39.500> T<00:03:39.590> moves<00:03:39.770> an<00:03:39.890> hour<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.820> it's<00:03:40.970> asking

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
for T moves an hour and then it's asking

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.140 
for T moves an hour and then it's asking
us<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.720> want<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.580> rest<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.970> game

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
us you want to have the rest of the game

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.490 
us you want to have the rest of the game
in<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.360> certain<00:03:44.600> number<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.870> time<00:03:45.020> we<00:03:45.200> could<00:03:45.380> go

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
in a certain number of time we could go

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.320 
in a certain number of time we could go
in<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.800> set<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> second<00:03:46.370> time<00:03:46.520> control<00:03:46.910> too<00:03:47.120> so

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
in and set a second time control too so

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.240 
in and set a second time control too so
you<00:03:47.390> can<00:03:47.480> actually<00:03:47.690> have<00:03:47.930> three<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:48.470> total<00:03:48.680> in

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
you can actually have three in total in

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.470 
you can actually have three in total in
this<00:03:49.370> case<00:03:49.580> we're<00:03:49.700> going<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.850> do<00:03:49.940> forty<00:03:50.270> moves

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
this case we're going to do forty moves

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.410 
this case we're going to do forty moves
in<00:03:50.660> an<00:03:50.780> hour<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.350> then<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> whole<00:03:52.220> game<00:03:52.550> left

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
in an hour and then the whole game left

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.050 
in an hour and then the whole game left
in<00:03:53.660> thirty<00:03:54.020> minutes

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
in thirty minutes

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.930 
in thirty minutes
so<00:03:56.060> now<00:03:56.270> forty<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.780> sixty<00:03:57.670> who's<00:03:58.670> not<00:03:58.820> going

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
so now forty and sixty who's not going

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.930 
so now forty and sixty who's not going
to<00:03:59.000> be<00:03:59.060> with<00:03:59.270> hourglass<00:04:00.580> keep<00:04:01.580> everything

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
to be with hourglass keep everything

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.270 
to be with hourglass keep everything
else<00:04:02.090> as<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.770> come<00:04:03.770> back<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:03.980> we're<00:04:04.250> ready

else as it is come back and we're ready

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.310 
else as it is come back and we're ready
to<00:04:04.489> play<00:04:04.700> now<00:04:05.360> we've<00:04:05.540> got<00:04:05.690> an<00:04:05.810> hour<00:04:05.930> for<00:04:06.080> these

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
to play now we've got an hour for these

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.080 
to play now we've got an hour for these
forty<00:04:06.650> moves<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.160> this<00:04:07.250> does<00:04:07.430> include<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.880> move

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
forty moves and this does include a move

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.990 
forty moves and this does include a move
timer<00:04:08.420> or<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.750> move<00:04:09.019> counter<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:10.220> black<00:04:10.730> at<00:04:10.910> the
