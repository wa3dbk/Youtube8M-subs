00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
iPhone 5 so the music I will be using is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.910 
iPhone 5 so the music I will be using is
a<00:00:10.370> song<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.580> use<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.240> iPhone<00:00:12.599> 4<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.830> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
a song to use on the iPhone 4 just to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.060 
a song to use on the iPhone 4 just to
show<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.219> off<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.730> new<00:00:14.910> features<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:16.070> my

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
show it off the new features and my

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.380 
show it off the new features and my
opinion<00:00:17.430> speaker<00:00:17.760> tests<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.150> kind<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
opinion speaker tests are kind of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269 
opinion speaker tests are kind of
pointless<00:00:18.630> even<00:00:19.080> though<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.980> know<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
pointless even though you know the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.679 
pointless even though you know the
speaker<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> audio<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.359> coming<00:00:21.660> through

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
speaker the audio is just coming through

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
speaker the audio is just coming through
your<00:00:21.990> speakers<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.740> based<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.130> your

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
your speakers and it's based on your

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.640 
your speakers and it's based on your
speaker's<00:00:23.789> itself<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.810> camera<00:00:25.500> or

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
speaker's itself not the camera or

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
speaker's itself not the camera or
whatever<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.730> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.269> opinion<00:00:27.689> I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
whatever just kind of like my opinion I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.670 
whatever just kind of like my opinion I
don't<00:00:27.840> know<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.170> kind<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> makes<00:00:28.529> sense

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
don't know if that kind of makes sense

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.910 
don't know if that kind of makes sense
to<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> guys<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.599> let's<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.679> ahead<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
to you guys but let's just go ahead and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910 
to you guys but let's just go ahead and
get<00:00:32.040> started<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> iPhone<00:00:33.180> 4s<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.920> they

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
get started with the iPhone 4s and they

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
get started with the iPhone 4s and they
both<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.579> full<00:00:35.850> blast<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:37.050> going

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
both are on full blast so that's going

00:00:37.230 --> 00:01:00.369 
both are on full blast so that's going
to<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.410> started

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.899 

all<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.789> now<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> louder

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
all right now I think this is louder

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
all right now I think this is louder
right<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.560> course<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.009> louder

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
right now but I of course it's louder

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
right now but I of course it's louder
right<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.850> let's<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.299> ahead<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.509> go<00:01:09.570> see

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
right now but let's go ahead and go see

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.480 
right now but let's go ahead and go see
which<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.380> louder<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> guys

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
which one is louder actually you guys

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.590 
which one is louder actually you guys
can<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.729> ahead<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:11.970> leave<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> comment<00:01:12.390> down

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
can go ahead and leave a comment down

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:39.250 
can go ahead and leave a comment down
below<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.189> yourselves<00:01:14.729> let<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.149> know

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.730 

all<00:01:40.260> right<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> iPhone<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
all right so there we go on the iPhone I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590 
all right so there we go on the iPhone I
think<00:01:44.580> it's<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> even

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
think it's kind of even

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
think it's kind of even
I<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.440> little<00:01:46.500> bit<00:01:46.710> louder<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I think it's a little bit louder on the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.100 
I think it's a little bit louder on the
4s<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.180> don't<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.509> maybe<00:01:48.690> it's<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.900> because

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
4s I don't know maybe it's just because

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.680 
4s I don't know maybe it's just because
he<00:01:49.350> hiked<00:01:49.530> 1/5<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.310> thinner<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:51.509> had

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
he hiked 1/5 is much thinner so they had

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.780 
he hiked 1/5 is much thinner so they had
to<00:01:51.780> change<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.320> don't<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.490> guys<00:01:53.610> can

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to change it I don't know you guys can

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.950 
to change it I don't know you guys can
go<00:01:53.940> ahead<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.150> leave<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.360> opinions<00:01:54.750> down

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
go ahead and leave your opinions down

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.930 
go ahead and leave your opinions down
below<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.580> equal

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
below but I think that kind of equal

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.170 
below but I think that kind of equal
almost<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> iPhone<00:01:59.070> 5<00:01:59.430> wins<00:01:59.729> um

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
almost but I think the iPhone 5 wins um

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.210 
almost but I think the iPhone 5 wins um
just<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.259> opinion<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:01.770> know

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
just my opinion I don't know

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.660 
just my opinion I don't know
I<00:02:02.450> think<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> iPhone<00:02:03.690> 4s<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.830> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I think the iPhone 4s I don't know it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
I think the iPhone 4s I don't know it's
kind<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.820> hard<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.060> tell<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.619> on

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
kind of hard to tell actually but on

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.279 
kind of hard to tell actually but on
that<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.130> speaker<00:02:08.700> test<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.539> new<00:02:09.750> iPhone

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289

that is a speaker test of the new iPhone
5<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.430> previous<00:02:11.910> model<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> iPhone
