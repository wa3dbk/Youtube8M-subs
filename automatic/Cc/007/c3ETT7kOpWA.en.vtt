00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.200
 Good day of the day I fought and so 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.320
 Today I will tell the installation of the device, I 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.849
 Toyota Corolla Tour 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.720
 the eighth year of release and so according 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.900
 to all and all of their instructions they offer 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.869
 we disassemble the panel that is, taking off yes 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.060
 but in principle, everything is easily removed tribute 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 but it takes a lot of time I 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.630
 I 'll show you another option 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.100
 easier more simple say why 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.940
 these complex ways that is this 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.780
 installing through the glove box I have it already 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.739
 set start with the fact that in principle 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.430
 he is with us 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.200
 Removable here clips that is not a clip like 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.120
 call them on because of the crack we 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.300
 move down this side too 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.989
 a little bit 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.399
 I'll have to tinker here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.769
 principle she leaves 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.749
 then there is let's say a cylinder 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.270
 removed it that's easy enough all in 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:15.740
 principle is removed even with one hand on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:25.829
 hands much easier and everything is in principle 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:29.340
 plug is he there yes here it is 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.219
 tape recorder plug then basically any 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.829
 hand thin more or less yes you can walk 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.799
 no problem to put on touch and do not need 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.219
 disassemble panels are made this mistakes 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:45.590
 and you will be easier and easier all the other well 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:49.139
 In principle, that's all the device itself works 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.319
 everything is fine the folder switches shakes 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:54.779
 one thing but a little worse than the disk but there is 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.619
 suspicion that the flash drive I like 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:02:02.579
 Sino order aliekspress problem 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.059
 I will try to download it in the south of 30 and 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.250
 card ride and compare later but about this 

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.869
 later in general so people don't 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.769
 bother with all the smooth roads 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.769
 is happy
