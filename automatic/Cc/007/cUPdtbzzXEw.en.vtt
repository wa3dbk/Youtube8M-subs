00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.429
 Unfortunately I forgot that I was not 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.050

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.460
 Normally snowboarding is good 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 obviously with which I'm recording 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 this and I recorded it with the headset 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.859
 nothing really happens but I guess that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.160
 eye to see what of what I say now 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 know that you have to leave the area of 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.790
 comfort and how you can not get out more than 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.790
 a comfort zone that going to the ncaa 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.399

 a guide was a clown sincerely not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.750
 I know if I do not remember if it's true 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.470
 true 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.470

 I think I have I like 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.140
 that comes to us people the stones are what 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.969
 we wanted for the dead felling ladder 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.630
 otherwise good morals or of each one have died 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.579
 that everything is alive thanks ham 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.579
 as a man who comes one below 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.739
 come good I think you think well let's go 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.440
 here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.720
 not because they could not stand in the long run 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.120
 turn this funny 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.060
 look they're all in the building this day 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.070
 today I'll heal for a second 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.500
 that the most silent until the map does not 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.270
 is that they are installing me when I erase 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.730
 attached to the stakeout 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.160
 we do not agree 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 I'm going to upload medium also 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.340
 form three to actually order 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.340
 try to stop or not 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.160
 a little bit but I run out of bullets 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.260
 I'm sorry it did not come 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.090
 what I was seeing and what was 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.750
 distributing all the moral 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.160
 go calm quiet 4 the staircase 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.960
 no caring re-enter no me 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.940
 I reassure now I get violent 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.810
 it has a nice name besides doctor very 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.810
 sensual 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.159
 because I think that's why so 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.629
 that the last games in is a bit 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.340
 no rhythm so now they have played 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.799
 those of the response to the best sounding 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.120
 as soon as clear nothing and it is simply in 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.379
 action 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.519
 I think I'm next to you, you can 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.519
 take a spark from there 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.110
 this cousin thinks with easy and 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.480
 we will know if they have done something 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.480
 as the theme of the heavens 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:57.350
 with the mouse this huge male is like 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:01.390
 The male titanic how much your mouse measures 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.390
 therefore 15 meters of length 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.030
 come let's see to the right 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.750
 I begin to explain and a little because 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.000
 it's so quiet this is that hey 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.190
 the two reasons may be wrong but 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.600
 these guys help, that is, from the station 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.700
 they are giving everything, you have to say the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.220
 true march today let's analyze 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.580
 because no one is kissing the map 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.580
 of horror 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.129
 with leaving the comfort zone in the 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.419
 ncaa I think without a doubt it is the 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.419
 site on the edge of yes 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.439
 precisely white reagent do not be 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.439
 prey of terror 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.360
 but good in sociological experiments 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:05.979
 but we are distributing children so 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.979
 least before I'll also go no but 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.449
 me are warming the head of a 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.449
 awesome way 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.539
 is that I look to the side and say 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:20.639
 there are not 360 degrees the plan girl 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.590
 Exorcist and I do not see anyone I 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.259
 it warms up my head that puts me 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.699
 Nervous , you know guys, well, what 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.749
 we can explode him the first 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.029
 cranial thermostat damaged and if web 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:35.849
 spoil an idea something something important 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.560
 you can spoil an air the reason 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.099
 I just ran out of slut moved 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.219
 investigates the pick up is in the building 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.219
 of wood 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.909
 no no 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.260
 and does not make a million with the pick up in 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.260
 hands 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.200
 I think I think there are people up there 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.050
 we have to take care of it as we go as if 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.400
 if it were next golden sun pica porridge 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.400
 as if it were a chopped 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.090
 look at how the casualties bloom more than 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.090
 we're going to have to take care now when 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.340
 the pickups are the rpg is light 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.319
 love I love we love those 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.319
 extinguish is that I will not touch them but 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:35.069
 extinguishes good because yes it is 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.160
 to name and with protection has to fight 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.160
 double triple 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.850
 please if double layer take care not bad 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.770
 where is everyone here with me 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.100
 I see you and I do not like what I see 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:13.130
 is that I'm not beautiful enough 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.130
 only for the nails 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:27.230
 doctor mussi hey is not for nothing but you 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.230
 I just got the tabulator and it's scary 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.160
 so I have not seen much but one meat 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.260
 to kill who were better than me to 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.460
 see my mother go cliche 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.600
 I am without a master I forgot that I am without 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.600
 masters the fucking main weapon 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:47.630
 good last low good because I have to 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.630
 recognize that nothing has happened 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.920
 I think I have to admit that it is not 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.920
 nothing bad 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.940
 the experiment has been fruitful to 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:01.129
 end of them leave the area of 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.520
 comfort has been the fourth factor I as 

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:03.520
 you have put
