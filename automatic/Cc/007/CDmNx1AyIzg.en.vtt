00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
lit the background how vile it myself

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
lit the background how vile it myself
well<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> first<00:01:28.979> thing<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> I've<00:01:30.000> kept

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
well the first thing is that I've kept

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
well the first thing is that I've kept
myself<00:01:30.420> away<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.229> background<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.890> avoid

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
myself away from the background to avoid

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.880 
myself away from the background to avoid
spill<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.880> secondly<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.170> I've<00:01:34.290> used<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
spill and secondly now then I've used a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.760 
spill and secondly now then I've used a
big<00:01:35.340> soft<00:01:35.670> light<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.750> Deaver<00:01:37.140> 400

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
big soft light and this was a Deaver 400

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920 
big soft light and this was a Deaver 400
and<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.280> slightly<00:01:38.610> off<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.240> side<00:01:39.270> well<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and it's slightly off to one side well I

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.190 
and it's slightly off to one side well I
put<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> other<00:01:40.439> side<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> flag

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
put on the other side is a bit of a flag

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
put on the other side is a bit of a flag
you<00:01:43.590> could<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.799> used<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.220> black<00:01:44.400> cloth

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you could have used a bit of black cloth

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.999 
you could have used a bit of black cloth
but<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.210> we've<00:01:45.420> used<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> reflector<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.680> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
but here we've used a reflector just so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
but here we've used a reflector just so
