dark after a little while yeah I think I

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.590 
dark after a little while yeah I think I
really<00:03:05.500> like<00:03:05.709> about<00:03:05.739> these<00:03:06.190> is<00:03:06.489> how<00:03:07.390> they're

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
really like about these is how they're

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.740 
really like about these is how they're
opposites<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.799> right<00:03:09.010> foot<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
opposites so on the right foot the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.710

outside<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.680> boot<00:03:12.000> has<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.239> more<00:03:13.450> simple

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
outside of the boot has the more simple

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.190 
outside of the boot has the more simple
design<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.480> can't<00:03:16.660> really<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
design and you can't really see the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.530
