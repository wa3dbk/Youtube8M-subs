00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
spots where these warden Keys can

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.610

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
actually be located right there is the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.350 
actually be located right there is the
first<00:00:33.890> one<00:00:34.040> you<00:00:34.070> can<00:00:34.280> see<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.460> change<00:00:34.910> stream

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
first one you can see the change stream

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.330 
first one you can see the change stream
whatever<00:00:35.600> hang<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:36.440> down<00:00:36.470> if<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.010> key<00:00:37.190> would

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
whatever hang it down if the key would

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.860 
whatever hang it down if the key would
actually<00:00:37.640> be<00:00:37.760> located<00:00:38.180> there<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.480> would<00:00:38.629> see

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
actually be located there you would see

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.440 
actually be located there you would see
the<00:00:39.110> Golden<00:00:39.620> Key<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.190> then<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.790> chain<00:00:41.059> itself

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
the Golden Key and then the chain itself

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.150 
the Golden Key and then the chain itself
would<00:00:41.660> actually<00:00:41.960> be<00:00:42.050> electric<00:00:42.559> fine<00:00:42.800> you're

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
would actually be electric fine you're

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.830 
would actually be electric fine you're
gonna<00:00:43.309> see<00:00:43.550> an<00:00:43.670> example<00:00:44.000> when<00:00:44.300> I<00:00:44.329> show<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:44.629> the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
gonna see an example when I show you the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.110 
gonna see an example when I show you the
second<00:00:45.200> location<00:00:45.320> here<00:00:46.190> just<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.550> second<00:00:46.969> but

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
second location here just a second but

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.430 
second location here just a second but
you<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.420> would<00:00:47.570> stand<00:00:47.750> out<00:00:47.960> like<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.110> sore<00:00:48.410> thumb

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
you it would stand out like a sore thumb

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.900 
you it would stand out like a sore thumb
if<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.010> there<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.309> you're<00:00:49.460> gonna<00:00:49.550> see<00:00:49.760> what

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
if it's there and you're gonna see what

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.160 
if it's there and you're gonna see what
it<00:00:50.000> would<00:00:50.120> look<00:00:50.210> like<00:00:50.270> here<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.780> just<00:00:50.899> a<00:00:51.020> moment

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
it would look like here in just a moment

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.740 
it would look like here in just a moment
anyways<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:52.460> what<00:00:52.670> these<00:00:52.820> warden<00:00:53.149> keys<00:00:53.300> do<00:00:53.510> or

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
anyways but what these warden keys do or

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.000 
anyways but what these warden keys do or
there's<00:00:54.110> different<00:00:54.440> cages<00:00:54.620> there's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
there's different cages there's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.130 
there's different cages there's
different<00:00:55.370> areas<00:00:55.699> around<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.059> map<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:57.020> you

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
different areas around the map that you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.810 
different areas around the map that you
cannot<00:00:57.440> access<00:00:57.980> unless<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.399> find<00:00:58.640> these

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
cannot access unless you find these

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.400 
cannot access unless you find these
warning<00:00:59.210> keys<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.510> can't<00:00:59.750> go<00:00:59.899> simply<00:01:00.230> you've

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
warning keys you can't go simply you've

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.170 
warning keys you can't go simply you've
spend<00:01:00.680> points<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.100> get<00:01:01.250> into<00:01:01.520> them<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.059> you've

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
spend points to get into them so you've

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.670 
spend points to get into them so you've
got<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:02.449> find<00:01:02.629> these<00:01:02.750> warden<00:01:03.140> keys<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.500> be<00:01:03.590> able

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
got to find these warden keys to be able

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.260 
got to find these warden keys to be able
to<00:01:03.829> have<00:01:04.009> access<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:04.489> these<00:01:04.729> different<00:01:05.149> areas

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
to have access to these different areas

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.730 
to have access to these different areas
so<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.630> think<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:06.080> pretty<00:01:06.200> cool<00:01:06.440> that<00:01:06.500> they

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
so I think it's pretty cool that they

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.770 
so I think it's pretty cool that they
did<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.130> there's<00:01:07.670> only<00:01:07.789> two<00:01:08.060> locations<00:01:08.600> so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
did that there's only two locations so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.180 
did that there's only two locations so
it<00:01:08.869> shouldn't<00:01:09.110> be<00:01:09.200> really<00:01:09.410> hard<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.160> is

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
it shouldn't be really hard but it is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.950 
it shouldn't be really hard but it is
what<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.759> it's<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.060> pretty<00:01:11.270> cool<00:01:11.479> thing<00:01:11.539> that

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
what it is it's a pretty cool thing that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.630 
what it is it's a pretty cool thing that
put<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.200> in<00:01:12.259> there<00:01:12.410> but<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.099> can<00:01:13.250> see<00:01:13.399> there

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
put it in there but you can see there

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.219 
put it in there but you can see there
from<00:01:13.849> the<00:01:13.970> new<00:01:14.090> perk<00:01:14.360> machine<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.869> simply

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
from the new perk machine you simply

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.779 
from the new perk machine you simply
drop<00:01:15.470> down<00:01:15.649> here<00:01:15.679> and<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.340> going<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.700> be

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
drop down here and this is going to be

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.150 
drop down here and this is going to be
the<00:01:16.970> second<00:01:17.390> location<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.649> see<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:18.979> key

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
the second location you can see the key

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.680 
the second location you can see the key
there<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:19.670> can<00:01:19.849> see<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.209> the<00:01:20.420> little

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
there and you can see that the little

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.749 
there and you can see that the little
string<00:01:20.990> pole<00:01:21.289> whatever<00:01:21.709> is<00:01:21.920> electrified

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
string pole whatever is electrified

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.820 
string pole whatever is electrified
that's<00:01:23.750> what<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.050> other<00:01:24.200> spot<00:01:24.530> will<00:01:24.679> look

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
that's what the other spot will look

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.650 
that's what the other spot will look
like<00:01:25.009> if<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> cue<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.640> there<00:01:25.819> itself<00:01:26.149> but<00:01:26.450> once

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
like if the cue is there itself but once

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.300
