00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
go heavy and you go above eight every

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.230 
go heavy and you go above eight every
rep<00:00:34.770> above<00:00:35.100> eight<00:00:35.310> your<00:00:35.640> foam<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.060> going<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
rep above eight your foam is going to

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.670 
rep above eight your foam is going to
start<00:00:36.480> getting<00:00:36.600> fucked<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.080> and<00:00:37.290> sloppy

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
start getting fucked up and sloppy

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.080 
start getting fucked up and sloppy
meaning<00:00:38.040> you're<00:00:38.160> gonna<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.430> closer<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
meaning you're gonna get closer to the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.780 
meaning you're gonna get closer to the
back<00:00:39.180> snap<00:00:39.450> action<00:00:39.630> so<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.800> came<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.310> between

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
back snap action so I came to between

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.180 
back snap action so I came to between
five<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.000> eight<00:00:42.240> for<00:00:42.990> strength<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:44.010> start

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
five to eight for strength to start

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.550 
five to eight for strength to start
someone<00:00:44.460> release<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.990> straight<00:00:46.350> power

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
someone release and just straight power

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.580 
someone release and just straight power
straight<00:00:47.100> poodle<00:00:47.760> shrimp<00:00:48.440> anything<00:00:49.440> higher

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
straight poodle shrimp anything higher

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.810 
straight poodle shrimp anything higher
than<00:00:49.620> eight<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.370> lifting<00:00:50.550> heavy

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
than eight you're not lifting heavy

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
than eight you're not lifting heavy
enough<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:51.690> understand<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.320> go

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
enough and if you understand you go

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
enough and if you understand you go
about<00:00:52.650> eight<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.400> might<00:00:53.610> fuck<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:53.970> shit<00:00:54.030> up

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
about eight you might fuck some shit up

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.390 
about eight you might fuck some shit up
so<00:00:54.330> I<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.050> always<00:00:55.380> advise<00:00:55.650> not<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.220> doing

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
so I just I always advise not not doing

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.910 
so I just I always advise not not doing
with<00:00:56.490> too<00:00:56.610> many<00:00:56.730> reps<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:58.170> deadlifts<00:00:58.770> if

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
with too many reps on on deadlifts if

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.620 
with too many reps on on deadlifts if
you<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.280> conventional<00:00:59.910> power<00:01:00.090> deadlifts

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
you don't conventional power deadlifts

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.230 
you don't conventional power deadlifts
if<00:01:00.990> you're<00:01:01.200> doing<00:01:01.470> on<00:01:01.880> what<00:01:02.880> I<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.090> doing
