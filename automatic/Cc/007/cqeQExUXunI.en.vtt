problem that they've been be interested

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.720 
problem that they've been be interested
in<00:00:15.299> seeing<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:15.960> I've<00:00:16.529> had<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.949> shock

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
in seeing this so I've had this shock

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.760 
in seeing this so I've had this shock
out<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.150> strut<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.140> car<00:00:19.350> bought

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
out of my strut out of my car bought

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
out of my strut out of my car bought
replacement<00:00:20.430> KY<00:00:20.699> B's<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.480> fit

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
replacement KY B's they don't fit

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
replacement KY B's they don't fit
because<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> coupe

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
because I have a coupe

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
because I have a coupe
despite<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:25.050> salesman<00:00:25.560> saying<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
despite the salesman saying they do the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550 
despite the salesman saying they do the
difference<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.060> wheel<00:00:27.930> sensor<00:00:28.410> that's

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
difference is this wheel sensor that's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.380 
difference is this wheel sensor that's
the<00:00:28.680> only<00:00:29.099> thing<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.820> tell<00:00:29.849> that's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the only thing that I can tell that's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.849 
the only thing that I can tell that's
different<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.960> actually<00:00:31.320> mounted<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
different because I actually mounted the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.069 
different because I actually mounted the
replacement<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.360> orientation<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
replacement one in the orientation of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.290 
replacement one in the orientation of
that<00:00:34.140> wheel<00:00:34.800> sensor<00:00:35.280> whole<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.730> different

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that wheel sensor whole is different

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.060 
that wheel sensor whole is different
unfortunately<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> square<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
unfortunately it's not a square it's a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
unfortunately it's not a square it's a
rectangle<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> doesn't<00:00:39.329> work<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.110> anyway

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
rectangle so it doesn't work but anyway

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.830 
rectangle so it doesn't work but anyway
so<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.940> say<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> past<00:00:42.420> couple<00:00:42.690> years

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so I would say for the past couple years

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.360 
so I would say for the past couple years
I've<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> nice<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.739> rattle<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> my

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I've had a nice little rattle in my

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.240 
I've had a nice little rattle in my
front<00:00:44.640> end<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.210> thought<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.920> took<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
front end and I thought I took it to the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
front end and I thought I took it to the
dealer<00:00:47.550> finally<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.180> told<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dealer finally and they told me that it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.250 
dealer finally and they told me that it
was<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> struts<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.280> bad<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:51.960> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
was the struts that's bad and you know I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
was the struts that's bad and you know I
guess<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:53.940> truth<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
guess that there is some truth to that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
guess that there is some truth to that
but<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> strut<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
but it's not really the strut that the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
but it's not really the strut that the
problem<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.120> other<00:00:57.329> than<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.780> strut<00:00:58.109> mount<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
problem is other than the strut mount I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.689 
problem is other than the strut mount I
don't<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
don't know if you can see that it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
don't know if you can see that it
tapered<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> top<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> strut<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.579> even

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
tapered the top of the strut so even

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
tapered the top of the strut so even
replacing<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> strut<00:01:03.359> mount<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.719> still<00:01:04.129> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
replacing the strut mount it's still is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
replacing the strut mount it's still is
gonna<00:01:05.309> make<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.030> rattling<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> stuff

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
gonna make some rattling and stuff

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.390 
gonna make some rattling and stuff
because<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.140> there's<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.409> play<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because some there's some play in that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.910 
because some there's some play in that
and<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.729> no<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.360> here's<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and that's no good but here's the the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.640 
and that's no good but here's the the
the<00:01:11.490> reason<00:01:11.850> why<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.420> sounds<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> piece<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the reason why it sounds like a piece of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
the reason why it sounds like a piece of
crap<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.430> bucket<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> bolts<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.810> wife<00:01:15.990> called

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
crap a bucket of bolts is my wife called

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
crap a bucket of bolts is my wife called
it<00:01:16.470> every<00:01:16.890> time<00:01:17.040> she<00:01:17.250> drove<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.360> any<00:01:18.750> time

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it every time she drove it so any time

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.830 
it every time she drove it so any time
you<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.320> any<00:01:19.890> type<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> imperfect

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
you were on any type of imperfect

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.999 
you were on any type of imperfect
surface<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> were<00:01:22.049> driving<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.830> would

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
surface you were driving on you would

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
surface you were driving on you would
hear<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> nasty<00:01:23.820> rattle<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.380> if

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
hear a nasty rattle and I don't know if

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260 
hear a nasty rattle and I don't know if
you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.670> oval<00:01:27.060> din

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you can see that but it's all oval din

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
you can see that but it's all oval din
there<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.630> check<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.189> look

inside there and we see if I can get
this<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.110> focus<00:01:31.350> look<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:31.799> much<00:01:31.950> clay<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.520> in

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
this in focus look how much clay is in

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.590 
this in focus look how much clay is in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it's probably the side of this banging
