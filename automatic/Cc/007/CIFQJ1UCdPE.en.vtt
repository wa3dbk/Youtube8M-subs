 more to see the lady foreign 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.080
 I am a neighbor of the neighborhood and participated in the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.580
 neighborhood association of Saint Nicholas who 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.350
 it's one block away 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.060
 with the compañera deals opinions and I 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.519
 I come usually do with people thing 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.470
 that the head of government does not do this 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.420
 I'm really outraged because when 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.400
 the misfortune passed that last week 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.049
 we had the governor scioli was 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.910
 present where is the head of government 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.120
 taking these people that honestly 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 It annoys me that people are damaged 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.480
 have to be of the life of the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.520
 neighbors that we bring you in solidarity 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.470
 something for them to eat 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 has come to help has brought water have 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.540
 I had food and I brought food and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.940
 empanadas dear to the people here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.340
 because I honestly hurts what is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.800
 happening and I'm a worker option 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.540
 nothing more than that but with sensitivity 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.490
 social and I show it because things 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.500
 you do not have to say them only in acts 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.390
 politicians have to prove it and 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.210
 prove it is being present and 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.740
 taking charge and helping even if you do not 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.260
 corresponds to take charge because I do not know 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.770
 if it really corresponds, I'm not 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.980
 expert in laws but 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.930
 of emergency they have been told that if they 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.910
 they do what they can of course but 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.560
 here to aim fundamentally is the head 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.730
 the head that commands that directs that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.470
 have to take charge as they are going to 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.780
 send to a shelter that you in 35 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.820
 ine reported that they have gone to a shelter 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.040
 where people go unfortunately 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.020
 destitute these people have lost their 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.640
