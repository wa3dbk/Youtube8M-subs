00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
anything but thank you I'll go over a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.590 
anything but thank you I'll go over a
few<00:00:36.989> things<00:00:37.610> starting<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> soul<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
few things starting with the soul it is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.240 
few things starting with the soul it is
a<00:00:39.629> molded<00:00:40.140> soul<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.430> compound<00:00:42.239> soul<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
a molded soul it's a to compound soul so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.200 
a molded soul it's a to compound soul so
basically<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> different

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
basically you can see the different

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
basically you can see the different
colors<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.079> white<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.920> absorb<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
colors the white is to absorb more of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
colors the white is to absorb more of
the<00:00:48.090> vibrations<00:00:48.780> soft<00:00:49.260> compound<00:00:49.530> softer

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the vibrations soft compound softer

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.279 
the vibrations soft compound softer
compound<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:51.300> wear<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> black<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> harder

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
compound to wear the black is a harder

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
compound to wear the black is a harder
compound<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> guys<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
compound so when a lot of guys have the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689 
compound so when a lot of guys have the
sharp<00:00:54.750> foot<00:00:55.110> pegs<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> it's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
sharp foot pegs so it's going to it's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.189 
sharp foot pegs so it's going to it's
going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> keep<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:57.449> digging<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
going to keep it from digging in and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
going to keep it from digging in and
things<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> last<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.489> lot

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
things like that is going to last a lot

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.150 
things like that is going to last a lot
longer<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:01.109> where<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.649> started<00:01:02.010> with

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
longer so that's where we started with

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
longer so that's where we started with
that<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.609> does<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.359> steel<00:01:03.660> shank<00:01:03.989> all

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that it does have the steel shank all

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.560 
that it does have the steel shank all
the<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:04.650> through<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.299> which<00:01:06.299> again

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the way down through it which again

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
the way down through it which again
gives<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> lot<00:01:07.260> more<00:01:07.439> support<00:01:07.950> strength

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
gives it a lot more support strength

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
gives it a lot more support strength
durability<00:01:09.299> through<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> boot<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.920> molded

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
durability through the boot the molded

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
durability through the boot the molded
part<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:12.049> lightens<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> boots<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
part also actually lightens the boots so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
part also actually lightens the boots so
you<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.310> layers<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you don't have all these layers it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
you don't have all these layers it
actually<00:01:15.840> brings<00:01:16.020> down<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> light<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
actually brings down the light of the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
actually brings down the light of the
boot<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.490> boot<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.270> lighter<00:01:18.570> which

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
boot or the boot you know lighter which

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
boot or the boot you know lighter which
