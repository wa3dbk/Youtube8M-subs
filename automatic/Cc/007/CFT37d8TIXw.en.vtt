00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:06.950
 now let's do what they call him 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.980
 drop eyes these can be done 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.030
 also on fabric or surfaces that do not 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.830
 have delineated the eyes we are going to 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.730
 mark it if you like they can do it 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.279
 first with pencil and then continue 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.220
 those with the brush and the paint 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.339
 in this case we use pure brush so that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.060
 see what can be done without needing 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.160
 do it previously with the pencil 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.190
 we mark we assume that the bottom in this 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.350
 case is already painted white and we are going to 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.710
 do the eye girl starting from the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.320
 top-down piquito filling 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.430
 up to the limit that we mark with the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.430
 delineated black 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.350
 we are always going to make sure they are 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.350
 Similar 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.129
 from the center outwards even though 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.289
 they have the line in any way the 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.640
 movement will always be the same as 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.640
 center out 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 We wait for the paint to dry and now 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 we go with the iris equal from above towards 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.120
 down the center on the sides without reaching 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.140
 to the lower part of the delineate 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.590
 they are suspended as you notice in this 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.590
 drawing 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.250
 from the center outwards always the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.250
 movements 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.100
 from the bottom part we can make a 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.220
 horizontal line to have the base and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.080
 side flanges give the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.080
 eyelashes from the center out 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.980
 following the outline of the eye 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.640
 from small to older always raising 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.730
 the tip brush to make them look 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730
 natural 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.180
 from the center out 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.530
 as thick as everyone wants 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.250
 and the tabs below we can only 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.580
 do three on each side and you see the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.300
 different effect 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.300
 the lights in this case we're going to do the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.140
 The lines are curved 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.430
 remember that straight lines almost no 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.430
 we must do in the eyes 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.230
 the eyebrows 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.230
 so that they also take expression
