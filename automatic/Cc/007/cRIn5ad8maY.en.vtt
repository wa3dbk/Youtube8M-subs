00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
see the black pyramid first we must

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
see the black pyramid first we must
reach<00:01:59.250> our<00:01:59.430> destination<00:01:59.580> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.420> we'll

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
reach our destination and then we'll

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.940 
reach our destination and then we'll
attempt<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.110> feud<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.560> submersion

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
but how can this ship go underwater it's

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.470 
but how can this ship go underwater it's
not<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> submarine

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480

Kasich<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:05.260> watch

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.730 

we<00:04:10.920> were<00:04:11.190> tilting<00:04:11.820> yes<00:04:12.630> were<00:04:13.020> adopting<00:04:13.620> a

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
we were tilting yes were adopting a

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.599 
we were tilting yes were adopting a
vertical<00:04:14.310> orientation

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.659 

Wow<00:04:20.659> this<00:04:21.620> control<00:04:22.039> room<00:04:22.189> goes<00:04:22.400> underwater

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
Wow this control room goes underwater

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.119 
Wow this control room goes underwater
and<00:04:23.150> detaches<00:04:23.689> from<00:04:23.719> the<00:04:24.050> ship<00:04:24.289> it's<00:04:24.650> designed

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
and detaches from the ship it's designed

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.480 
and detaches from the ship it's designed
to<00:04:25.340> function<00:04:25.610> as<00:04:25.969> an<00:04:26.120> observation<00:04:26.389> unit

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
to function as an observation unit

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.059 
to function as an observation unit
so<00:04:29.180> will<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:29.990> get<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.169> see<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.530> black<00:04:30.710> pyramid

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
so will we get to see the black pyramid

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.830 
so will we get to see the black pyramid
first<00:04:31.460> we'll<00:04:31.669> observe<00:04:31.789> it<00:04:32.150> from<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.419> distance

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
first we'll observe it from a distance

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.170 
first we'll observe it from a distance
it<00:04:33.289> was<00:04:33.500> just<00:04:33.740> discovered<00:04:34.310> her<00:04:34.430> satellite<00:04:34.970> so

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
it was just discovered her satellite so

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.150 
it was just discovered her satellite so
