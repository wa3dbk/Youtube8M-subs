00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.320
 another factor to take into account in the transmission of the message is the own 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.169
 receiver are some people easier to persuade than others 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.060
 according to the receiver's intelligence we will see how with a high level 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.290
 intellectual receptivity will be greater but nevertheless they will have a 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.660
 Minor involvement of messages even though these are more complex 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.990
 the opposite happens with people with an intellectual level under something 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.010
 similar happens with self-esteem 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.370
 the greater the greater the receptivity but the lower the acceptance 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.100
 France also influences needs to be at a stable level for 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 cause a good perception of the person 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 the needs or motivations that each subject has to think will determine the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 most effective message 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.510
 We are talking about people with restless mentalities active in the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.530
 that to persuade we will need solid and argued messages in 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 opposed to those lazy people who tend to trust the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.600
 others' criteria so persuading them presumes them much easier 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.880
 in terms of resistance persuasion we can highlight four 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.020
 cases 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 vaccination to those people saturated by the propaganda are 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 difficult to persuade 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.220
 in relation to social stereotypes we will find that women 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.350
 they are more persuasive less vulnerable men styles 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.140
 persuasion in women is greater when the issuer is a male and the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.420
 communication is group age does not have to affect persuasion but 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.210
 yes the knowledge that people possess so a child will have 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.910
 greater vulnerability than an adult person 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.500
 on the other hand we must name the need for social approval issue 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.950
 according to this factor can be divided ntr directed subjected to the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.750
 media self-directed fashions that enjoy greater self-government 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.629
 Another factor to be taken into account in the response of the Estigarrian hearing 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.199
 in the afternoon before signs of manipulation, little action reacts 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.279
 way contrary to the desired 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.079
 they also determine the success of the message the commitment so in 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.499
 publicly expressed attitudes propaganda is less effective by the 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.409
 passive resistance in cases of informative saturation the good 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.759
 communicating would serve to attract the attention of the receiver and remove it from its 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.439
 passivity 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.439
 fifteen 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.459
 3 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.019
 finish 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.089
 Social marketing consists in the use of the principles and techniques of 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:55.009
 commercial marketing to influence groups you have to get them to accept 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.609
 reject modify or abandon a behavior according to the interest of the 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.249
 transmitter 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.010
 to make possible the development of these campaigns 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.760
 It is necessary that they conform to a planning in which the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.689
 fundamentals of the process including investigating the problem your environment and 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.109
 the nature of the recipients on whom you want to influence 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.269
 then the message and the materials are developed defining what is wanted 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.269
 transmit and the support in which it will be made 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.360
 is the moment of the pp seriously estimated messages with test individuals 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.340
 Depending on the response obtained, the elements of the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.080
 message so that its impact is greater 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.570
 later it is proceeded to the implementation or was executive of the plan 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.710
 has said supervising every part of it 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.130
 finally proceeds to the hasty evaluation the evaluation takes place in 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.590
 the whole process and the ticking from the very development of the message 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.099
 Once the issuer decided his proposal he must select his target co-recipient 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.900
 to which it is addressed can be the whole general audience in a more 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:59.710
 specific 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.279
 a specific group 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.569
 despite all the success of these campaigns is not always the expected is 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.239
 difficult to convince people not to do things and less things that 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:10.110
 like 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.200
 These are some of the guidelines that can ensure success 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.710
 1 take advantage of what has already been done and we know 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.379
 start with more predisposed target populations 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.110
 3 use simple and clear terms 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.129
 4 consider the incorporation of something tangible that helps promote the 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.909
 behavior 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.110
 5 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.229
 clearly understand and manage the benefits kilos costs 6 facilitate a 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.229
 easy access to the possibility of change 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.219
 build messages that attract attention and motivate 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.309
 use forms that involve the audience 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:53.349
 9 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.030
 provide recipients with simple response elements 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.469
 assigns appropriate resources to the desired number and frequency 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.240
 peres and success is still not the expected 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.599
 may be because there is still time to mature this type of marketing and 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.900
 this will continue to achieve little by little with the loyalty of people who join 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.900
 the one that already exists 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:27.490
