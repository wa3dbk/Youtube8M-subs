00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone welcome to a special 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.250
 vision of my channel I am quite a year 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.069
 you this time we look back end 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.290
 from the seth green 1 and 2 but this time 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.170
 we answer your questions 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.830
 so year ago now much early where the more 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 apples 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 yes best hour to be more apples too 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.330
 were even 6 to be precise and one 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 these six words still wanted 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 by the Templars 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 only the only drawback is that one 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.980
 of these apples is a hands of edgy 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.719
 is hardcore and one of these apples 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.280
 gone on the screen you have broken 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 already placed him who tells how 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.809
 apple 4 and then the during broke 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.860
 read more if you want and then go 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.860
 we move on to the next question 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.410
 Nabil Kramer existed early 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.180
 Knights Templar then real and yes Nabil 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.610
 Knights Templar really existed for you 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.980
 not too far in but the Templars 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.890
 wares and emails brotherhood and won 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.190
 strings actually and it got after 50 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.170
 year pass and a law to bear arms 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.420
 and with a knightly order 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 this knightly order enters the crusade 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.450
 against the Muslims to the holy land 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.340
 conquer in name for the Christians 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.140
 they only became brains from nearby 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.300
 betrayed by the pope and the king 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.979
 together plot had planned among Templars 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.740
 free fall time because they stop 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.929
 got too much power and too much money and 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.190
 on Friday the 13th they became Templars 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.320
 really picked up 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.539
 so you also come from Friday the 13th 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.789
 and from then on the Templars 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.899
 declared outlaw in 1314 with a 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.060
 last grandmaster of the Templars 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.590
 so great most rest leader 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.569
 supreme leader 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.179
 burnt at the stake was his name 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.740
 the jacques doze and malayed 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.440
 pronounced a curse on the pope and the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.869
 king and among them died 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.520
 Not six months later from here 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.530
 also find no further evidence that the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.410
 Knights Templar still exist like the S's 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.410
 creed series is trying to prove it 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.959
 so everything ss creed told is pure 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.489
 fiction and you must keep the top there 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.979
 Templars really existed 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.780
 like hashish us only 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.770
 other forms and 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.450
 in a completely different story 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.940
 and what humanity do we need there now 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.120
 imagine a mixture well no 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.310
 Maya believed it was ours 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.400
 humanity two other people today 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.160
 and these two other people 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.489
 said the first one was mud 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.290
 only Dees was a bit too flexible and washable 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.310
 not hard enough to stay 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.110
 stand 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.629
 so the next humanity that created 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.930
 was to be loved was a humanity 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.379
 wood only this one site could not be good 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.319
 move and that's why the gods thought of it 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.489
 according to the maya a mixture of 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.260
 crushed ice and water and that is the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.870
 humanity that we now join 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.870
 we are humanity according to the mayas 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.720
 from the ground mine and the water 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.769
 complete nonsense but she believes in it and 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.390
 you used to be 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.879
 ss and they once really existed 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.950
 dot dot they dj huppelepup 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.379
 download dj huppelepup from a cunt name 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.640
 first and second and they have SS 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.930
 never really existed 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.909
 I can call you myself is angry about it 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.319
 are considered dirty as three 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.209
 also recently uploaded a video 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.970
 they say that the SS is 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.549
 do not exist before 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.430
 ss is have not existed ss is 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.220
 derived from the word hashish and hashish 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.269
 in here is referred to in the ss in screen 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.040
 series 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.750
 machines were led by the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.430
 grandmaster all in 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.299
 only if you might remember 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.739
 was the final boss of sss crete one 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.159
 for the grandmaster turns 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.829
 ultimately against you a chance or 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.950
 passions hash how I want to say that 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.109
 were a song and Muslim warriors 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.959
 and these 1 liter Muslim warriors went 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.010
 don't go out with contracts to people 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.370
 to kill 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.340
 no this one left Muslim warriors 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.410
 fought in the crusade in a war 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.169
 against the Templars 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.180
 no more there is no evidence that the 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.889
 hare jackets also really kill people 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.650
 through contracts 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.660
 this is just really not true at all 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.419
 whatever becomes a seth green 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.650
 said is simply completely based on 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.660
 a myth 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.010
 where the harsh us people would 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.900
 kill for a contract 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.199
 while that is not at all what the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.099
 haig oceans where and left 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.610
 Muslim fighters 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.210
 who fought for the Holy Land more 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.430
 not 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.590
 so they fought against the Templars 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.229
 is the only thing true in the ss 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.570
 creed series for the rest the hash oceans 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.419
 in which a liter of Muslim fighters 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.000
 and they are ultimately again 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.699
 perish with such as the Templars and 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.240
 nothing of that can be recovered either 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.449
 found in the society of which we are now 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.849
 thus complete fiction 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.160
 jochen 322 its natural is dashboard 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.330
 family of her country to breathe life 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.400
 I had the first human on earth 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.979
 and therefore everyone 's family 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.360
 well no that's not according to the ss one 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.090
 screen series 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.210
 because as you may have seen in 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.120
 In the previous video I told the gods 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.819
 people used as slaves and adam 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.039
 and Eve were one of these slaves 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.530
 were therefore several people on the earth 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.120
 according to assassin's creed and if you almost 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.680
 life stands everywhere and actually theirs 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.300
 breath and briefly at first two people were 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.280
 on earth but according to assassin's 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.340
 creed that is not true and where the multiple 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.310
 people an to and eva became known because 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.690
 she stole the apple or whooping steel 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.970
 and that is actually told 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.880
 in the Bible only the gods become 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.370
 excited and that's basically all 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.669
 I tell you something about this question 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.880
 so on to the next road taco 1601 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.750
 she is one of three that girl lucy 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.030
 hashtag brotherhood 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.880
 well i don't want to go into that further 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.690
 but i can tell you that lucy no 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.870
 eva is 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.430
 and somewhere is actually by far the eva 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.380
 let me put it that way 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.810
 nice looking at the end of a seth 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.430
 green brute that comes online tomorrow 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.780

 I make this next video but 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.240

 then
