00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.330
 good time of day with you again i'm leila 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:14.040
 I want to show you a water lesson how to do 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:20.070
 I open the photoshop water file 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.830
 prepared a picture we remove the lock 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.359
 left mouse click twice 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:32.119
 ok now i will do 11 frames cuff with 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.119
 using the buttons on the keyboard kontrol g 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 then in the animation window here, here I press 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.920
 on a triangle 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 I create frames from layers here we have the first 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 active frame we will make here too first 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.600
 the active layers are the lowest right now for me 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.100
 need to allocate water I will endow so 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 I take the tool this brush with a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 vodka if you have a magic 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.689
 wand means right click and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.689
 we take the tool a type fast selection 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.659
 so here with a plus sign I take a brush 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.799
 a small big is not necessary by 2 to 3 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.790
 pixel to not take much 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:26.350
 I will take 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:31.750
 At 6, in principle, judged by the picture you need 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.860
 in size, well, I 'll take 4 and start 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 introduce our water 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.260
 Here I introduce her 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.630
 if something is circled just do not take here 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.520
 here is a side by side brush with a minus and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:09.870
 we fix on the tree I drove 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.870
 a little extra on the stone drove 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.330
 so I am correcting a little bit 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.330
 we remove 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.870
 take a smaller brush 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.190
 two pixels 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.190
 I'll pick out a piece of paper 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.190
 pebble 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.190
 caught us too paws bait 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.220
 and I got about trying 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.600
 that is, on the plus sign we brush on 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.600
 minus we fix choose only nothing 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.770
 we should not be animated 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.750
 here I found our water in the whole picture 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:29.600
 what we do next is go filter 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:32.690
 ocean wave distortions here i put 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.640
 such parameters sat the waves and leave on 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.700
 I have very strong waves 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.080
 unnecessary here I put down also on 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.390
 one size further raped 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.420
 will not change so it will 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.930
 stay in the same place 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:58.360
 click ok go to the second frame and above 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:02.560
 on the filter layer distortion ocean waves 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:09.260
 move here on 2 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.120
 ok go to the third frame on the layer above 3 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.120
 below 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 filter 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.820
 distortion ocean waves go for 3 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.050
 ok 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.150
 go to the fourth frame on the layer above 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.510
 filter 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.750
 distortion ocean waves and come back 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:42.160
 here at number 2 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:50.110
 ok go 5 a layer above the filter 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.110
 distort ocean waves one ok 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.060
 on the sixth frame above the filter layer 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:07.069
 ocean wave distortion 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:12.660
 points 2 points okay on frame 7 one layer above 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:17.030
 filter distortion ocean waves on 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.229
 number 3 swap okay 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.880
 move to the eighth frame 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:26.370
 going up a layer more filter 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.840
 ocean wave distortions come back 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.039
 back to number 2 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:37.430
 okay the ninth frame higher oil and filter 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:41.720
 ocean wave distortions 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.790
 back to the number q1 ok 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.920
 on the tenth frame 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:52.910
 on a layer above the ocean distortion filter 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:59.840
 waves on 2 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:00.990
 ok we go to 1 st and to the layer above the filter 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.490
 distortion 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:09.540
 ocean waves at 3 ok 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.740
 and on the last one on 12 and on the layer above 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.970
 filter distortion ocean waves and 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.800
 back at 2 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:24.660
 ok we get up on the first frame in the window 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.540
 animation on 1 lower layer we clamp 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.990
 on the keyboard shift and click on 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.770
 the last frame is all wrapped around here 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:39.660
 set down time 0 2 seconds our 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.990
 Animation is ready is our our waterfall 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.990
 water 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.469
 to save the animation file save 

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:52.229
 for web devices 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:52.229
 and save as gif 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:00.179
 save 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:00.179
 on the desktop save 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.520
 our animation is ready 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.710
 here is a wonderful some water happened 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.509
 luck 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:19.169
 waiting for your work so thanks for 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.169
 Attention
