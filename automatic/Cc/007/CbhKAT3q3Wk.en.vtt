00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.929 
time holding their hands in the past
I've<00:00:23.480> made<00:00:23.750> boards<00:00:24.500> for<00:00:24.800> each<00:00:24.950> of<00:00:25.160> them<00:00:25.340> with<00:00:25.910> a

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
I've made boards for each of them with a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.940 
I've made boards for each of them with a
slanted<00:00:26.570> slot<00:00:26.899> that<00:00:27.169> they<00:00:27.290> could<00:00:27.439> hold<00:00:27.800> their

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
slanted slot that they could hold their

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.130 
slanted slot that they could hold their
cards<00:00:28.279> in<00:00:28.579> sits<00:00:29.000> on<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.329> table<00:00:29.689> in<00:00:29.779> front<00:00:29.809> of

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
cards in their hand like the big people

do<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:38.629> other<00:00:38.780> day<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.020> saw<00:00:39.320> in<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.530> store<00:00:39.800> a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
do the other day I saw in a store a

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.760 
do the other day I saw in a store a
pround<00:00:40.850> plastic<00:00:41.660> card<00:00:41.990> holder<00:00:42.380> I<00:00:42.410> thought

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
pround plastic card holder I thought

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.520 
pround plastic card holder I thought
well<00:00:43.070> why<00:00:43.280> can't<00:00:43.580> that<00:00:43.760> be<00:00:43.840> wood<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.110> round

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
well why can't that be wood and round

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.650 
well why can't that be wood and round
after<00:00:46.040> all<00:00:46.190> if<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:46.910> can<00:00:47.030> make<00:00:47.150> it<00:00:47.180> from<00:00:47.450> wood<00:00:47.630> I

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
after all if I can make it from wood I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.420 
after all if I can make it from wood I
don't<00:00:48.050> want<00:00:48.260> plastic<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.390> designed<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.430> card

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
don't want plastic so I designed a card

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.840 
don't want plastic so I designed a card
holder<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.690> kids<00:00:54.110> can<00:00:54.440> use<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:55.070> hold<00:00:55.370> their

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
holder that kids can use to hold their

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.920 
holder that kids can use to hold their
cards<00:00:57.550> it's<00:00:58.550> actually<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.390> fairly<00:00:59.780> simple

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
cards it's actually a fairly simple

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.469 
cards it's actually a fairly simple
design<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:01.570> consists<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.690> two<00:01:03.020> outer<00:01:03.369> disks

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
design it consists of two outer disks

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.719 
design it consists of two outer disks
that<00:01:05.479> are<00:01:05.540> tapered<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.350> middle<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.979> enable

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
that are tapered in the middle to enable

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.480 
that are tapered in the middle to enable
slide<00:01:08.060> any<00:01:08.360> card<00:01:08.630> easily<00:01:09.049> between<00:01:09.380> them<00:01:09.680> as<00:01:10.250> an

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
slide any card easily between them as an

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.620 
slide any card easily between them as an
edge<00:01:10.729> there<00:01:11.920> these<00:01:12.920> outer<00:01:13.609> cylinders<00:01:14.389> are

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
edge there these outer cylinders are

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.879 
edge there these outer cylinders are
head<00:01:14.960> held<00:01:15.409> in<00:01:15.619> place<00:01:15.829> with<00:01:16.639> a<00:01:16.670> inner<00:01:17.179> hollow

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:17.889 
head held in place with a inner hollow

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:21.789 
head held in place with a inner hollow
cylinder<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.689> they're<00:01:20.869> aligned<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
cylinder so that they're aligned the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.590 
cylinder so that they're aligned the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
tension is provided by a elastic band

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.819 
tension is provided by a elastic band
this<00:01:27.139> actually<00:01:27.740> was<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.249> girl's<00:01:28.700> hair<00:01:29.179> band<00:01:29.829> now

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
this actually was a girl's hair band now

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.059 
this actually was a girl's hair band now
to<00:01:30.889> keep<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.609> in<00:01:31.880> place<00:01:32.329> there's<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:33.439> very

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
to keep that in place there's a very

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.669 
to keep that in place there's a very
small<00:01:34.520> disc<00:01:35.179> in<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.810> case<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.200> made<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.499> from

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
small disc in this case I made it from

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.109 
small disc in this case I made it from
maple<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:38.380> enables<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.529> to<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:40.700> tension

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
maple that enables that to be in tension

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.639 
maple that enables that to be in tension
and<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:42.049> hold<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.619> other<00:01:42.799> plates<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.459> place

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
and to hold the other plates in place

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.080 
and to hold the other plates in place
then<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:45.829> fairly<00:01:46.100> easy<00:01:46.490> for<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.810> child<00:01:48.679> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
then it's fairly easy for a child to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.510 
then it's fairly easy for a child to
insert<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.240> card<00:01:50.859> and<00:01:53.079> to<00:01:54.079> be<00:01:54.259> able<00:01:54.409> to<00:01:54.619> play

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
insert the card and to be able to play

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.879 
insert the card and to be able to play
their<00:01:55.759> hand<00:01:56.109> so<00:01:57.109> let's<00:01:57.439> make<00:01:57.829> a<00:01:59.109> child's<00:02:00.109> card

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
their hand so let's make a child's card

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.120 
their hand so let's make a child's card

these could have been two solid pieces
of<00:02:12.800> wood

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of wood

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
of wood
I've<00:02:13.860> put<00:02:14.130> small<00:02:14.460> pieces<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.940> double<00:02:15.660> stick

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I've put small pieces of double stick

between them and a wood faceplate I'm

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.330 
between them and a wood faceplate I'm
rounding<00:02:21.000> them<00:02:21.150> off<00:02:21.360> together<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:22.340> ensure

rounding them off together to ensure

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340 
rounding them off together to ensure
that<00:02:23.370> they<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> same<00:02:24.270> diameter<00:02:24.600> this

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that they are the same diameter this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.410 
that they are the same diameter this
seemed<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.710> be<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.890> reasonable<00:02:26.730> option<00:02:26.910> rather

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
seemed to be a reasonable option rather

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.560 
seemed to be a reasonable option rather
than<00:02:27.720> measuring<00:02:28.230> both<00:02:28.790> these<00:02:29.790> rings<00:02:30.150> are<00:02:30.510> a
