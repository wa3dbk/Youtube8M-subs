so obviously it's it's easy to pick out

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
so obviously it's it's easy to pick out
the<00:01:01.109> Tepig<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.710> probably<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> best<00:01:02.430> starter

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the Tepig is probably the best starter

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
the Tepig is probably the best starter
out<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> theory<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.809> he<00:01:03.930> has<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> high

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
out of the theory because he has a high

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
out of the theory because he has a high
HP<00:01:04.890> attack<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> fence<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.689> pretty

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
sure in the beginning they don't have

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640
