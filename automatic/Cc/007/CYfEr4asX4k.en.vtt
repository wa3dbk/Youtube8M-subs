00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
probably the best in the game and that's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
probably the best in the game and that's
exactly<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.789> occurred<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.240> had<00:00:30.480> no<00:00:30.720> problem

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
beast of a gun and I'm not really going

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to go too much into these statistics

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.660

on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> battlefield<00:01:00.570> absolutely<00:01:01.350> no<00:01:01.500> problem

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
on the battlefield absolutely no problem

on the battlefield absolutely no problem
but<00:01:02.609> instead<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.210> listing<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.930> many<00:01:04.199> reasons

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
but instead of listing the many reasons

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
but instead of listing the many reasons
why<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.820> fantastic<00:01:06.330> weapon<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
why this is just a fantastic weapon and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810 
why this is just a fantastic weapon and
arguably<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.950> best<00:01:08.159> weapon<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> game

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
arguably the best weapon the game

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
arguably the best weapon the game
currently<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.570> wanted<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.439> talk<00:01:10.830> about<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
currently I wanted to talk about why is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.810 
currently I wanted to talk about why is
going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.930> nerfed<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.040> upcoming<00:01:14.250> patch

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
going to be nerfed in the upcoming patch

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
going to be nerfed in the upcoming patch
which<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.330> probably<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.960> released<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
which will probably be released when the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.210

just assuming with dices past track
record<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> probably<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> come

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

you<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.479> dice<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.409> nerfing

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you that dice was going to be nerfing

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.410 
you that dice was going to be nerfing
one<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.280> favorite<00:01:41.700> weapons<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> game

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
one of your favorite weapons in the game

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.800 
one of your favorite weapons in the game
and<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> arguments<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:45.540> brought

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and one of the arguments that is brought

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.039 
and one of the arguments that is brought
up<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.439> there<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:46.860> always<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.850> be

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
up is that there are always going to be

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.149 
up is that there are always going to be
weapons<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.259> battlefield<00:01:49.740> 3<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.130> are

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
weapons in battlefield 3 that are

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.370 
weapons in battlefield 3 that are
overpowered<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> people<00:01:51.630> should<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.140> deal

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
overpowered and people should just deal

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.539 
overpowered and people should just deal
with<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.770> there's<00:01:53.009> there's<00:01:53.310> never

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
with it because there's there's never

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
with it because there's there's never
going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.899> happy<00:01:55.140> medium<00:01:55.590> where<00:01:55.890> all

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
going to be this happy medium where all

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.709 
going to be this happy medium where all
the<00:01:56.399> weapons<00:01:56.729> feel<00:01:56.909> balanced<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.509> there's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the weapons feel balanced and there's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
the weapons feel balanced and there's
never<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.380> weapon<00:01:58.799> or<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> couple<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.369> weapons

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
never one weapon or a couple of weapons

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.030 
never one weapon or a couple of weapons
that<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.570> better<00:02:00.810> than<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> rest<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.920> mean

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that are better than all the rest I mean

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.319 
that are better than all the rest I mean
it's<00:02:02.159> always<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.909> case<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
it's always going to be the case that

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
it's always going to be the case that
there<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.320> best<00:02:04.619> weapon<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> game<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
there is the best weapon in the game and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.089 
there is the best weapon in the game and
while<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.869> agree<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
while I do agree with you there is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.979 
while I do agree with you there is
probably<00:02:08.550> never<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> situation

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
probably never going to be a situation

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.860 
probably never going to be a situation
where<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.400> complete<00:02:12.030> balance<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.750> all

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
where you have complete balance for all

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.290 
where you have complete balance for all
the<00:02:13.020> gun

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the gun

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.490 
the gun
right<00:02:13.960> now<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.220> m16a3<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:16.450> seems<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:17.020> be<00:02:17.230> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
right now the m16a3 just seems to be a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.680 
right now the m16a3 just seems to be a
little<00:02:17.860> bit<00:02:18.040> too<00:02:18.520> powerful<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.240> mean<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.510> has<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
little bit too powerful I mean it has a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.380 
little bit too powerful I mean it has a
fantastic<00:02:20.410> rounds<00:02:21.040> per<00:02:21.190> minute<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.850> also<00:02:22.030> has

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
fantastic rounds per minute it also has

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.290 
fantastic rounds per minute it also has
a<00:02:22.420> blazing<00:02:23.230> fast<00:02:23.620> reload<00:02:24.130> time<00:02:24.460> probably<00:02:24.820> one

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
a blazing fast reload time probably one

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.120 
a blazing fast reload time probably one
of<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.570> fastest<00:02:25.990> reload<00:02:26.320> times<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.920> game

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
of the fastest reload times in the game

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.370 
of the fastest reload times in the game
it<00:02:27.580> also<00:02:27.730> has<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.270> same<00:02:28.540> damage<00:02:28.810> model<00:02:29.200> of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it also has the same damage model of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.990 
it also has the same damage model of
pretty<00:02:29.620> much<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.190> assault<00:02:30.490> rifles<00:02:30.910> so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
pretty much all the assault rifles so

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000 
pretty much all the assault rifles so
it's<00:02:31.150> not<00:02:31.270> like<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.690> were<00:02:31.870> compensating<00:02:32.770> less

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's not like you were compensating less

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.090 
it's not like you were compensating less
damage<00:02:33.460> for<00:02:33.760> faster<00:02:34.270> reload<00:02:34.570> time<00:02:34.870> or<00:02:35.140> higher

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
damage for faster reload time or higher

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.980 
damage for faster reload time or higher
rpm<00:02:36.670> you're<00:02:36.880> doing<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> same<00:02:37.330> damage<00:02:37.660> there

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
rpm you're doing the same damage there

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.990 
rpm you're doing the same damage there
and<00:02:38.200> also<00:02:39.010> probably<00:02:39.370> one<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> best

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and also probably one of the best

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.360 
and also probably one of the best
aspects<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> gun<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.710> has<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> very

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
aspects of the gun is that it has a very

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
aspects of the gun is that it has a very
manageable<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.210> minimal<00:02:43.690> recoil<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.350> so

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
manageable and minimal recoil and so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.940 
manageable and minimal recoil and so
that<00:02:44.680> coupled<00:02:45.100> with<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.970> very<00:02:46.450> fast<00:02:46.840> rpm<00:02:47.380> you're

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that coupled with a very fast rpm you're

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.040 
that coupled with a very fast rpm you're
going<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.640> well<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.180> pretty<00:02:49.660> much<00:02:49.690> any

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
going to do well in pretty much any

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.630 
going to do well in pretty much any
situation<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.710> can<00:02:50.830> do<00:02:50.950> well<00:02:51.190> up<00:02:51.400> close

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
situation you can do well up close

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.280 
situation you can do well up close
because<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.000> fast<00:02:52.330> rpm<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.840> you're<00:02:53.140> going<00:02:53.230> to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
because the fast rpm and you're going to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.140 
because the fast rpm and you're going to
do<00:02:53.410> well<00:02:53.620> at<00:02:53.800> long<00:02:53.980> range<00:02:54.340> because<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.000> can

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
do well at long range because you can

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.820 
do well at long range because you can
stay<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.540> target<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.080> because<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.650> fast

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
stay on target and because of the fast

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.290 
stay on target and because of the fast
rpm<00:02:57.220> as<00:02:57.340> well<00:02:57.490> you're<00:02:57.790> going<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:57.970> take<00:02:58.150> out

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
rpm as well you're going to take out

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.420 
rpm as well you're going to take out
those<00:02:58.480> long<00:02:58.780> range<00:02:59.050> targets<00:02:59.440> pretty<00:03:00.130> quickly

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
those long range targets pretty quickly

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.760 
those long range targets pretty quickly
as<00:03:00.760> well<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.330> that's<00:03:01.750> probably<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.740> main

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
as well and that's probably the main

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.610 
as well and that's probably the main
reason<00:03:03.040> right<00:03:03.670> there<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:04.150> why<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.900> weapon<00:03:05.380> is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
reason right there is why this weapon is

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.010 
reason right there is why this weapon is
is<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.460> so<00:03:06.730> often<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.300> why<00:03:07.510> people<00:03:07.870> think

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
is you so often and why people think

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.080 
is you so often and why people think
it's<00:03:08.200> overpowered<00:03:08.680> because<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.310> really<00:03:09.790> does

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
it's overpowered because it really does

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's overpowered because it really does
not<00:03:10.270> have<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> situation<00:03:10.900> where<00:03:11.710> it<00:03:12.070> does

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
not have a situation where it does

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.310 
not have a situation where it does
poorly<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.120> does<00:03:13.330> well<00:03:13.510> up<00:03:13.630> close<00:03:13.870> does<00:03:14.140> well

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
poorly it does well up close does well

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.530 
poorly it does well up close does well
at<00:03:14.410> medium<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:14.950> long<00:03:15.250> range<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.390> not

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
at medium and long range and it's not

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.270 
at medium and long range and it's not
like<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:16.990> does<00:03:17.200> okay<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:18.100> those

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
like it just does okay in those

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.830 
like it just does okay in those
situations<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.180> actually<00:03:19.480> quite<00:03:19.630> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
situations it's actually quite the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.990 
situations it's actually quite the
opposite<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.320> performs<00:03:20.800> very<00:03:21.220> well<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.760> pretty

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
opposite it performs very well in pretty

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240 
opposite it performs very well in pretty
much<00:03:22.060> any<00:03:22.330> engagement<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.220> that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
much any engagement and in that in that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.280 
much any engagement and in that in that
right<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.880> fact<00:03:25.180> right<00:03:25.420> there<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.959> why<00:03:26.260> i

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
right that fact right there is why i

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.210 
right that fact right there is why i
believe<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.400> m16a3<00:03:28.200> does<00:03:29.200> deserve<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.950> nerve

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
believe the m16a3 does deserve a nerve

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.680 
believe the m16a3 does deserve a nerve
and<00:03:30.459> what<00:03:30.760> they're<00:03:30.880> doing<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.209> increasing<00:03:31.330> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and what they're doing is increasing the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690 
and what they're doing is increasing the
recoil<00:03:32.050> which<00:03:32.260> i<00:03:32.410> think<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.830> fine<00:03:33.190> because

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
recoil which i think is fine because

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.720 
recoil which i think is fine because
right<00:03:34.150> now<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.690> use<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.350> high<00:03:35.770> rpm<00:03:36.340> weapon

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
right now if you use a high rpm weapon

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.270 
right now if you use a high rpm weapon
which<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.120> exactly<00:03:37.270> what<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.810> m16a3<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.130> let's

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
which is exactly what the m16a3 so let's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.310 
which is exactly what the m16a3 so let's
say<00:03:39.370> you're<00:03:39.520> using<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.940> AEK<00:03:40.660> or<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.020> famas

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
say you're using the AEK or the famas

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.199 
say you're using the AEK or the famas
you<00:03:41.800> do<00:03:41.980> very<00:03:42.250> well<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.760> close<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.180> personal

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
you do very well up close and personal

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.790 
you do very well up close and personal
at<00:03:43.690> me<00:03:43.840> or<00:03:43.989> medium<00:03:44.410> range<00:03:44.620> engagements

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
at me or medium range engagements

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.410 
at me or medium range engagements
because<00:03:45.370> you're<00:03:45.489> able<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.850> stay<00:03:46.060> on<00:03:46.180> target

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
because you're able to stay on target

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420 
because you're able to stay on target
but<00:03:46.959> when<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.200> go<00:03:47.350> for<00:03:47.560> those<00:03:47.650> long<00:03:47.980> range

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
but when you go for those long range

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.340 
but when you go for those long range
shots<00:03:48.910> you're<00:03:49.300> gonna<00:03:49.570> have<00:03:49.900> some<00:03:50.170> problems

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
shots you're gonna have some problems

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.740 
shots you're gonna have some problems
because<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:50.920> harder<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.370> stay<00:03:52.330> on<00:03:52.510> target

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
because it's harder to stay on target

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.540 
because it's harder to stay on target
and<00:03:53.020> manage<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.440> recoil<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.010> that's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
and manage the recoil and that's

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.670 
and manage the recoil and that's
something<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.209> m16a3<00:03:55.900> doesn't<00:03:56.530> have<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
something that the m16a3 doesn't have a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680 
something that the m16a3 doesn't have a
problem<00:03:56.920> with<00:03:57.250> because<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.640> its<00:03:57.940> very<00:03:58.209> mental

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
problem with because of its very mental

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.420 
problem with because of its very mental
recoil<00:03:59.140> so<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.770> fact<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.070> they<00:04:00.220> are<00:04:00.400> going

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
recoil so the fact that they are going

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.330 
recoil so the fact that they are going
to<00:04:01.000> be<00:04:01.120> increasing<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.780> recoil<00:04:02.230> seems<00:04:02.680> like<00:04:03.100> a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
to be increasing the recoil seems like a

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.000 
to be increasing the recoil seems like a
perfect<00:04:03.910> solution<00:04:04.110> because<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.530> seems<00:04:05.770> like

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
perfect solution because it seems like

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.520 
perfect solution because it seems like
the<00:04:06.430> m16a3<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.239> supposed<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.690> be<00:04:07.810> more<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.140> a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the m16a3 is supposed to be more of a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.800 
the m16a3 is supposed to be more of a
close<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:09.070> medium<00:04:09.400> range<00:04:09.700> weapon<00:04:10.090> because<00:04:10.660> of

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
close to medium range weapon because of

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.320 
close to medium range weapon because of
its<00:04:10.930> higher<00:04:11.170> rpm<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:12.519> in<00:04:12.760> my<00:04:12.880> opinion<00:04:13.000> I

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
its higher rpm so in my opinion I

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.540 
its higher rpm so in my opinion I
honestly<00:04:13.750> think<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:14.680> an<00:04:14.800> okay<00:04:15.100> in<00:04:15.370> an

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
honestly think that it is an okay in an

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.090 
honestly think that it is an okay in an
okay<00:04:15.910> change<00:04:16.359> with<00:04:16.959> regard<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.620> criticism

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
okay change with regard to the criticism

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.470 
okay change with regard to the criticism
that<00:04:18.130> dice<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.609> never<00:04:18.820> going<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.180> achieve

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
that dice is never going to achieve

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.690 
that dice is never going to achieve
perfect<00:04:20.049> weapon<00:04:20.320> balance<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:21.130> they<00:04:21.430> shouldn't

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
perfect weapon balance so they shouldn't

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.810 
perfect weapon balance so they shouldn't
bother<00:04:22.320> nerfing<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.470> m16a3<00:04:24.070> because<00:04:24.610> other

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
bother nerfing the m16a3 because other

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.230 
bother nerfing the m16a3 because other
gun

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.999 
gun
zorg<00:04:25.539> are<00:04:25.840> going<00:04:26.139> to<00:04:26.289> rise<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:26.979> occasion

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
zorg are going to rise to the occasion

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.309 
zorg are going to rise to the occasion
and<00:04:27.550> become<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.330> flavor<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.020> month<00:04:29.139> and

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
and become the flavor of the month and

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.930 
and become the flavor of the month and
everyone's<00:04:29.620> going<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.800> use<00:04:29.949> that<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.430> think

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
everyone's going to use that I think

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.059 
everyone's going to use that I think
that's<00:04:31.120> kind<00:04:31.539> of<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.960> cop-out<00:04:32.380> because<00:04:32.710> if<00:04:32.860> dice

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
that's kind of a cop-out because if dice

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.550 
that's kind of a cop-out because if dice
had<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.699> mentality<00:04:33.819> and<00:04:34.419> they<00:04:34.780> just<00:04:35.110> gave<00:04:35.349> us

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
had that mentality and they just gave us

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.260 
had that mentality and they just gave us
the<00:04:35.680> game<00:04:35.830> as<00:04:36.039> it<00:04:36.310> was<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.789> didn't<00:04:37.120> perform

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the game as it was and didn't perform

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540 
the game as it was and didn't perform
weapon<00:04:37.870> balance<00:04:38.199> and<00:04:38.380> stuff<00:04:38.560> like<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.740> then

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
weapon balance and stuff like that then

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.040 
weapon balance and stuff like that then
the<00:04:39.669> game<00:04:39.819> would<00:04:40.000> become<00:04:40.330> very<00:04:40.690> stale

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
the game would become very stale

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.320 
the game would become very stale
extremely<00:04:41.949> quickly<00:04:42.190> because<00:04:42.580> everyone<00:04:43.090> would

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
extremely quickly because everyone would

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.150 
extremely quickly because everyone would
use<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.900> same<00:04:44.110> weapon<00:04:44.530> because<00:04:44.800> if<00:04:44.889> they<00:04:45.009> use

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
use the same weapon because if they use

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.969 
use the same weapon because if they use
another<00:04:45.400> gun<00:04:45.610> they<00:04:46.210> wouldn't<00:04:46.569> be<00:04:46.870> as<00:04:47.110> if<00:04:47.560> as

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
another gun they wouldn't be as if as

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.339 
another gun they wouldn't be as if as
effective<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.849> I<00:04:49.180> don't<00:04:49.479> think<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.110> what

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
effective and I don't think that is what

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.990 
effective and I don't think that is what
people<00:04:50.680> are<00:04:50.949> looking<00:04:51.160> for<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.610> game<00:04:51.759> they're

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
people are looking for in a game they're

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.510 
people are looking for in a game they're
looking<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.389> variety<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:53.080> they<00:04:53.889> don't<00:04:54.130> want

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
looking for variety and they don't want

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.790 
looking for variety and they don't want
to<00:04:54.699> have<00:04:54.849> every<00:04:55.300> single<00:04:55.509> person<00:04:55.990> using<00:04:56.500> the

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
to have every single person using the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.920 
to have every single person using the
same<00:04:57.099> gun<00:04:57.400> because<00:04:57.819> it<00:04:58.180> would<00:04:58.419> lead<00:04:58.630> to<00:04:58.659> a<00:04:58.810> very

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
same gun because it would lead to a very

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.379 
same gun because it would lead to a very
stale<00:04:59.500> game<00:04:59.770> so<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.310> honestly<00:05:00.729> think<00:05:01.270> that

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
stale game so I honestly think that

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.529 
stale game so I honestly think that
every<00:05:01.780> time<00:05:02.050> that<00:05:02.530> dice<00:05:02.889> does<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.699> pallet<00:05:04.120> does

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
every time that dice does a pallet does

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:05.909 
every time that dice does a pallet does
a<00:05:04.569> balance<00:05:04.990> patch<00:05:05.199> like<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:05.650> they're

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
a balance patch like this they're

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.680 
a balance patch like this they're
getting<00:05:06.009> closer<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.520> closer<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:07.030> that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
getting closer and closer to that

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.659 
getting closer and closer to that
perfect<00:05:08.139> gun<00:05:08.319> balance<00:05:08.710> as<00:05:08.860> long<00:05:09.340> as<00:05:09.490> they<00:05:09.610> do

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
perfect gun balance as long as they do

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.399 
perfect gun balance as long as they do
it<00:05:09.940> smart<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.449> mean<00:05:10.569> if<00:05:10.659> they<00:05:10.750> if<00:05:10.930> they<00:05:11.080> just

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
it smart I mean if they if they just

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.040 
it smart I mean if they if they just
make<00:05:11.949> huge<00:05:12.310> shifts<00:05:12.759> in<00:05:12.909> the<00:05:13.389> weapon<00:05:13.690> balance

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
make huge shifts in the weapon balance

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.390 
make huge shifts in the weapon balance
then<00:05:14.409> of<00:05:14.560> course<00:05:14.590> they're<00:05:14.919> never<00:05:15.039> going<00:05:15.250> to

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
then of course they're never going to

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.219 
then of course they're never going to
achieve<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:15.880> but<00:05:16.419> as<00:05:16.569> long<00:05:16.750> as<00:05:16.780> they<00:05:16.990> do<00:05:17.050> it

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
achieve that but as long as they do it

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.960 
achieve that but as long as they do it
incrementally<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.250> would<00:05:18.610> have<00:05:18.699> liked<00:05:18.880> it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
incrementally and I would have liked it

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.219 
incrementally and I would have liked it
if<00:05:19.060> they<00:05:19.180> did<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.479> lot<00:05:19.599> more<00:05:19.630> frequently

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
if they did it a lot more frequently

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:21.540 
if they did it a lot more frequently
what<00:05:20.740> if<00:05:20.830> they<00:05:20.860> did<00:05:21.009> it<00:05:21.099> a<00:05:21.159> little<00:05:21.250> bit<00:05:21.430> more

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
what if they did it a little bit more

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.159 
what if they did it a little bit more
incrementally<00:05:21.940> then<00:05:22.599> they're<00:05:22.930> going<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.110> get

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
incrementally then they're going to get

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.930 
incrementally then they're going to get
closer<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.590> closer<00:05:23.889> and<00:05:24.069> people<00:05:24.520> are<00:05:24.610> finally

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
closer and closer and people are finally

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.420 
closer and closer and people are finally
going<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.330> start<00:05:25.569> to<00:05:25.720> use<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:26.229> larger<00:05:26.919> range<00:05:27.159> of

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
going to start to use a larger range of

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.270 
going to start to use a larger range of
weapons<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:29.110> my<00:05:29.289> opinion<00:05:29.380> that<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:30.009> a<00:05:30.039> good

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
weapons and in my opinion that is a good

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.219 
weapons and in my opinion that is a good
thing<00:05:30.460> for<00:05:30.669> battlefield<00:05:31.090> 3<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:31.509> I<00:05:31.719> just<00:05:32.020> don't

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
thing for battlefield 3 so I just don't

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.430 
thing for battlefield 3 so I just don't
think<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:33.009> is<00:05:33.280> a<00:05:33.580> good<00:05:33.849> excuse<00:05:34.449> that<00:05:35.050> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
think that is a good excuse that the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.310 
think that is a good excuse that the
m16a3<00:05:36.130> is<00:05:36.699> shouldn't<00:05:37.300> be<00:05:37.479> nerfed<00:05:37.719> because<00:05:38.139> if

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
m16a3 is shouldn't be nerfed because if

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.930 
m16a3 is shouldn't be nerfed because if
it<00:05:38.620> does<00:05:38.800> another<00:05:39.070> weapon<00:05:39.280> is<00:05:39.490> going<00:05:39.639> to<00:05:39.699> rise

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
it does another weapon is going to rise

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.189 
it does another weapon is going to rise
to<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.210> occasion<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.719> they're<00:05:40.870> never<00:05:40.990> going

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
to the occasion and they're never going

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.290 
to the occasion and they're never going
to<00:05:41.380> achieve<00:05:41.469> perfect<00:05:42.280> weapon<00:05:42.520> balance<00:05:42.969> you

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
to achieve perfect weapon balance you

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.490 
to achieve perfect weapon balance you
know<00:05:43.389> shirt<00:05:43.690> that's<00:05:44.050> never<00:05:44.199> going<00:05:44.349> to<00:05:44.409> happen

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
know shirt that's never going to happen

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.249 
know shirt that's never going to happen
but<00:05:45.190> they<00:05:45.430> should<00:05:45.610> still<00:05:45.880> strive<00:05:46.659> for

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
but they should still strive for

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.930 
but they should still strive for
perfection<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:48.099> is<00:05:48.130> something<00:05:48.460> everyone

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
perfection that is something everyone

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.249 
perfection that is something everyone
should<00:05:49.150> strive<00:05:49.599> for<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.020> is<00:05:50.139> no

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
should strive for and that is no

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.959 
should strive for and that is no
different<00:05:50.620> for<00:05:50.710> dice<00:05:50.889> but<00:05:51.370> overall<00:05:51.639> I<00:05:51.789> think

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
different for dice but overall I think

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.360 
different for dice but overall I think
that<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.389> nerve<00:05:52.570> to<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.870> m16a3<00:05:53.560> is<00:05:53.979> going<00:05:54.250> to

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
that the nerve to the m16a3 is going to

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.040 
that the nerve to the m16a3 is going to
be<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.550> good<00:05:54.849> thing<00:05:54.909> for<00:05:55.150> battlefield<00:05:55.690> 3<00:05:55.840> it's

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
be a good thing for battlefield 3 it's

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.510 
be a good thing for battlefield 3 it's
going<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.229> put<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.469> more<00:05:56.620> in<00:05:56.889> line<00:05:56.919> with<00:05:57.190> the

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
going to put it more in line with the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.129 
going to put it more in line with the
other<00:05:57.550> weapons<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.360> people<00:05:58.599> are<00:05:58.690> going<00:05:58.870> to<00:05:59.020> be

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
other weapons and people are going to be

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.649 
other weapons and people are going to be
able<00:05:59.229> to<00:05:59.440> use<00:05:59.710> other<00:06:00.009> weapons<00:06:00.520> other<00:06:00.699> than<00:06:00.940> the

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
able to use other weapons other than the

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.839 
able to use other weapons other than the
m16a3<00:06:02.409> I<00:06:02.889> don't<00:06:03.370> think<00:06:03.550> they're<00:06:03.639> going<00:06:03.789> to

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
m16a3 I don't think they're going to

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.790 
m16a3 I don't think they're going to
nerf<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.180> into<00:06:04.389> oblivion<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.050> if<00:06:05.199> you<00:06:05.349> like<00:06:05.590> to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
nerf it into oblivion so if you like to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.260 
nerf it into oblivion so if you like to
use<00:06:05.979> it<00:06:06.159> you're<00:06:06.250> still<00:06:06.460> going<00:06:06.520> to<00:06:06.789> be<00:06:07.030> able<00:06:07.090> to

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
use it you're still going to be able to

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.029 
use it you're still going to be able to
use<00:06:07.419> it<00:06:07.449> for<00:06:07.810> probably<00:06:08.110> short<00:06:08.590> to<00:06:08.770> medium

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
use it for probably short to medium

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.129 
use it for probably short to medium
range<00:06:09.250> engagements<00:06:09.430> but<00:06:10.330> for<00:06:10.599> long-range

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
range engagements but for long-range

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.080 
range engagements but for long-range
combat<00:06:11.530> because<00:06:12.069> of<00:06:12.190> its<00:06:12.310> high<00:06:12.370> recoil<00:06:12.849> you're

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
combat because of its high recoil you're

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.010 
combat because of its high recoil you're
going<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:13.270> probably<00:06:13.449> want<00:06:13.719> to<00:06:13.750> stick<00:06:13.990> with

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
going to probably want to stick with

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.189 
going to probably want to stick with
something<00:06:14.590> like<00:06:15.039> the<00:06:15.250> new<00:06:15.370> scar<00:06:15.729> l<00:06:16.000> or<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.750> AK

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
something like the new scar l or the AK

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.409 
something like the new scar l or the AK
you're<00:06:17.680> no<00:06:17.889> longer<00:06:18.219> going<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.610> be<00:06:18.699> able<00:06:18.909> to<00:06:19.210> use

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
you're no longer going to be able to use

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.409 
you're no longer going to be able to use
one<00:06:19.810> gun<00:06:20.139> for<00:06:20.800> every<00:06:21.400> situation<00:06:21.610> so<00:06:22.150> I<00:06:22.180> think

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
one gun for every situation so I think
