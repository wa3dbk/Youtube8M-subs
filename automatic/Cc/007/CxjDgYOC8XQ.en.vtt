 for the optimal success of the service is 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.150
 Nails need to be well 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.279
 dry in order to ensure a 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.869
 perfect product adhesion avoid 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.869
 to perform hand cleanses or to use 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.880
 creams and lotions after organizing the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.950
 hands with purifying spray nozzle for 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 fashion to do a manicure 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.899
 preparatory giving shape to the nail with 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.760
 a 240 great file to push 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.030
 gently cuticle to release 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.800
 the nail plate dulls 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.600
 the surface of the nails slightly 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.160
 with a white block and remove the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 excess powder with a toothbrush 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.260
 step1 rep

 this product restores ph ed 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.300
 removes any residue from the nail plate 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.430
 of humidity apply a single coat 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.800
 the product is not very thin 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.840
 necessary to abound completely 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 invisible and not shiny it dries to the area 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.490
 not desired the skin and guarantees the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.830
 success of the next steps does not go 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.960
 catalyzed closed to a promoter of 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.490
 non-acid adhesion creates a bond with the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.260
 color and extends the life of the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 lacquering does not need to be 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.180
 catalyzed thanks to closed by 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.979
 catch lasts for weeks apply in the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.020
 a small amount on the tip for 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.580
 to prevent the color from crumbling is 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.440
 the application on the whole is not recommended 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.430
 nail plate if not unique 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.430
 subjected to strong stresses 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.850
 bass 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.730
 is the first step of the process 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.820
 uv led catalyst works by protecting 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.960
 long and to avoid pigmentation 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 apply a very thin layer of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.350
 produced on the nails of a hand having 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.720
 care to spend it even in the corner 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.000
 free and introduce the hand in the lamp 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.740
 catalyze LED required for seconds or 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.810
 uv for 120 seconds 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.429
 in the meantime proceed with the application 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.429
 of the base on the other hand 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.959
 for the success of the service i 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.670
 Product pigments must be 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.280
 uniformed by mixing the color with 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.810
 the help of the mixing tool is not necessary 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.819
 repeat the operations every time 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.440
 a mixed treatment is performed 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.390
 the color only once at the beginning 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.310
 of the day recover the product 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.500
 left with the brush coming is pure 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.420
 gel does not contain cellulose then the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.980
 product is thinner more not glossy 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.860
 long desired and does not evaporate in the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.780
 container after spreading a hand 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.510
 very thin color will catalyze LEDs 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.629
 for 30 seconds or a uv for 120 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.910
 second apply the colors on the other 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.160
 mom then proceed to a second 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.900
 pass the ideal condition for 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.760
 facilitating removal is that of 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.129
 use very little product and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
 make very thin applications 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.099
 guaranteed duration and the effect will be 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.099
 decidedly more natural 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.050
 apply at the end of the service one 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.790
 thin layer of top though not 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.040
 leaving out the free angle of the nail 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.840
 catalyze with LEDs for 30 seconds or 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.840
 or a uv for 120 seconds 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.330
 conditional cleanser to guarantee 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.849
 the uniformity of the formula shake well 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.319
 before use 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.090
 this product combines a solution 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.849
 degreaser that remove up to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.110
 dispersion from the nail surface 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.040
 moisturizes the cuticles and prevents the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.360
 dehydration of skin and nails 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.959
 use a clean ball for each 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.290
 nail repeats the procedure on the other 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.290
 but no 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.870
 for an even brighter finish 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.850
 massaging of all the life one drop 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.660
 of cuticle oil and polish with a 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.660
 dry ball
