00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I'm actually getting put stuff here

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.039 
I'm actually getting put stuff here
because<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> looks<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> flimsy<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.780> begin

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
because it looks kind of flimsy to begin

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.590 
because it looks kind of flimsy to begin
with<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> only<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.329> keeping

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
with and the only thing that's keeping

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
with and the only thing that's keeping
it<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.880> together<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> guess<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.470> open<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it like together I guess to not open is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.350 
it like together I guess to not open is
this<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.400> slit<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.060> supposed<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this little slit and you're supposed to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
this little slit and you're supposed to
put<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.659> plastic<00:01:43.229> part<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.369> i

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
put this plastic part in there so i

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.819 
put this plastic part in there so i
don't<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.909> i<00:01:45.030> should<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.930> i<00:01:46.259> don't

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
don't know if i should do that i don't

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.960 
don't know if i should do that i don't
know<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.100> i<00:01:47.159> should<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.430> anything<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.880> there

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that's really neat then i have this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.399

other<00:01:54.360> pencil<00:01:55.200> case<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.420> yeah<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.200> for

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409

498<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.250> i<00:01:59.399> could<00:02:00.030> say<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.689> kind<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
498 which i could say was kind of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
498 which i could say was kind of
expensive<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:02.369> also<00:02:02.549> had<00:02:02.759> pencil
