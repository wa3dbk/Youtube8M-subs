00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.990
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.640
 Suhr Bunzel on our server 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.189
 the atomic community Punke he is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.429
 but on the tenth of tenth 11th 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.480
 Meisterfeier point my luck and he is but if I'm on a name 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 have agreed 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.240
 as the county Minden were the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.119
 and now before 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.779
 APA 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.230
 that still talk 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.009
 so products 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.909
 to ... more 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.679
 Ground Zero is only short Prokop Bayer off or switch 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.580
 exactly and Klose again the same 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.160
 but why do not you care? 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.880
 more league 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 always get used to that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.170
 since the video has changed a lot that was from the Miami NovaStor other types 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.180
 made 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.010
 I'm doing mine now 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.870
 and then we have a few extras 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.670
 for example, enjoy dapd 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.260
 down there 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.480
 still work 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 Koller and Bochum 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 good Brunner himself lifts 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.560
 boy now where car back 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.860
 the third 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.100
 and the Bütt Gauls who bring themselves 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.920
 the Croatian approach them 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.760
 you can also learn a lot 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.610
 we'll build it because then 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.850
 in turn, if you do not meet 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.260
 if someone looks at me again 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 conditioned by Todd Lodwick 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.460
 Vogt Fletcher goes under 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.360
 who here are the rule 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.390
 to be able to read that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.020
 finally with his if the conductor has already read and then 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.619
 just made here 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.190
 For reasons of caution 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 Plop Plopp Plopp 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.190
 are important to me 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.330
 Aaron was over info 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.340
 that's that big "i" year that's a bit weird 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.480
 but cool 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.840
 and then you always looked up to her - I did it all over Copenhagen ever 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 to change 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.150
 is always the newest 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.270
 with Steinmeier that the money house 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.520
 There you can buy a lot of things 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 So back there plug and cool what do I know 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.669
 here is the house offering and dying 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.439
 he can do there were partly or 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.759
 Water still gold invest again suicide 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.929
 OT Matteo and place 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.039
 and there 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.349
 Luckow 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.479
 the Joh 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.329
 and has 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.739
 Non-voters under it 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.739
 and how Exit Intel understands it stung 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.119
 out of the world 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.839
 Guti Peter Meier and then it continues 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.659
 Bad Boller is all listed wart that will always 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.509
 is rejected 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.159
 but best top cooking 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.200
 now the evening show because you can buy things to sell and so on 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.479
 This smells of houses and houses already built by their existence 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.140
 But they would like to confirm even more people open to expect 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.979
 do well on Main / MA 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
 farmland 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.510
 Brega 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.969
 no trees cases 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:09.840
 none 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.409
 Houses build under the normal area 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.299
 and now again with the pope 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.099
 modern subordinate your prix-winner Sandberg to the fan of the community Piglet 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.809
 now 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.919
 infinite source of water 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:22.800
 serve this 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.969
 take now 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:25.869
 and 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.329
 Almeida a little further one in the way 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.249
 as reported I should show myself 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.619
 within sight in Kommern to Nine 2 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.299
 and then we'll do it 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.459
 / was park 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.029
 FachPack 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.180
 and that is already 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.809
 chess out to the end 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 I'll do it away 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.349
 sit here inviting 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.149
 together and trap Adventure was missing 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.149
 this one should then give the others the blocks under the feet way a 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.189
 and BVB 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.979
 Pale BVB 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:00.689
 think about 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.279
 the guards then there were the two now 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.809
 Thanks, I'm still telling 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.359
 structurally also world 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.359
 Yes, I have already made video about it, I could also like to arrive 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.959
 I have to keep the description clean in the evening 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.699
 Williamson too and later than at around 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:21.519
 he already said 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.409
 I write then new patient moves 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.340
 Percent MP Zietlow 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.800
 he fell in the 90th 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.349
 the b 91 sec. i 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.120
 our moderators so moderator can not be monster »probably 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.170
 and we actively cost money 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.800
 10 euros forever 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.169
 Wiesenthal urge that you have to do it 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.719
 and you have to easily Unna 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:44.960
 NNP counts 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.050
 build steeply 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.050
 when it's back to our park 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.090
 Praxair then we have slightly inferior to that 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.969
 Rebuilt by the Eise Honisch 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.009
 and yes and they also came old property if you want 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.650
 or Corner the text get along or 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.069
 and build 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.099
 exactly 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.200
 then a dance partner would have to say what kind of house you want to hear 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200
 then the ski-world sang something with play money 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.689
 it is targeted too 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.370
 Arnd Berger 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.370
 nevertheless escape i made it once 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.699
 added storage direction 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.979
 we ask Bobke round yes this but stupid my much bigger 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.610
 argue and sensuous segments recording 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.120
 Korzynietz her 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.339
 yes darob 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.339
 Christoph t and not too 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.810
 Now finally seminar that will not show you any beliefs in this game now 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.029
 one looks 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.289
 in the bunch 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.659
 I hope you liked that Sarah, I think I always seems to be 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:55.410
 and 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.249
 thinker 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.369
 we forgot everything 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:01.509
 denies or 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.800
 think again 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 because yes was exactly on the knife tree 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.270
 you can turn off failure 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.540
 new tree would drive and pianoforte still inserted 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.469
 March you act and then comes on 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.740
 yes, and then it's nice to change big 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.939
 if that's the case, no trees will concreted anymore 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:30.050
 then we'll put it back so please do not go to plan as what 

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.020
 very bad 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.900
 not really but 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.119
 better not 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.449
 it's much faster 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.059
 new breasts then we have here 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:42.699
 the name here at the side so the latest things Irish Scott his head 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:43.719
 went 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.659
 this work has the drawing short 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.439
 because you can get that high and 9 percent back 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.469
 No Weidmann ESO can be installed or something 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.129
 Gold via PayPal 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.790
 then you can also go down again 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.790
 I express to coach Torsten Reuter thematically because of the water flow 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.289
 and 4 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.139
 then we have a few houses left 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.979
 there's 11 on the way also knows Manuela Better 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.979
 only with Nathan Chapman could 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.189
 Stylish entry on the grave 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:17.419
 You then drive a little bit of Backgammon Cicero 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:18.990
 and always like that 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.270
 under high hurdles 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.919
 and yes that was it 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.729
 what was it? 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.639
 I think 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.529
 I like comparing Stegner I have s 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.149
 at least 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:32.819
 and
