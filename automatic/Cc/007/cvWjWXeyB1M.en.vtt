00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello girls good morning evenings are 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.589
 nights here I am to give you a tip 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.620
 super fast when you break the 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.410
 shadows or when they break completely 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.139
 or a little bit is damaged and sometimes when 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.690
 you have only a little corner 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.350
 keep breaking then better am is 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.620
 repair them and we will use the shade 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.170
 that broke me in this case this is the 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.920
 bootecito the buoy in which in this 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.370
 because it broke completely and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.050
 let's occupy this me in my case I'll 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.610
 occupy a needle right now I will tell you 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.880
 so that this one is the one called makeup 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.420
 finish and spray or makeup fixer 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.370
 spray is from marquez and this one serves to 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.200
 fix the makeup when a long time ago 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.410
 heat or when you want the makeup 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.840
 last longer this then this is 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.360
 the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 the spray for this that is impeccable 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 the makeup though then we're going to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.370
 apply spray in the shade to the little boat 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.070
 and we are going to cast him the shadow or without 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.970
 nothing else repair anything else is this to 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.960
 compose it 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.510
 the part that was damaged for you I already threw it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.870
 Kim with this needle what I'm going to go 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.860
 doing it is common to get wet 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.640
 all all all of the shadow if 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.380
 you need more milk spray by throwing 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.950
 matter that you spend what you wanted there 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 it got very wet no matter what it was 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.800
 base then we're going to put it to dry 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.730
 already in my case how all the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.850
 shadow 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.520
 all all 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.420
 then I will repair it all 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.310
 completely if it's just a part 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.729
 you only apply that little part is not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.850
 necessary that you destroy all the shadow 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.880
 okay 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.280
 here it is already being like a masita I 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 I still have the little boat still has 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.100
 shades 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.970
 I'm going to keep throwing it all 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 and the same will I go 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.300
 since it is well wet it becomes a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.660
 cochinero is like that is that they do in a 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 where they are not, no matter what 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.600
 dirty of shadow and that you can use a 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.780
 flat surface to go be 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.630
 pressing the shadow or sometimes with your the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.380
 same finger but also as I tell you 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.200
 he makes a vile cochinero if he takes the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.850
 finger and sometimes it hits you if this is a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.720
 flat surface then what are they going 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.100
 doing nothing more 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.100
 is accommodating 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.530
 clean the edges this type I 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.690
 my director shared that at the same time 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.990
 he shared it in one of our sisters 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.390
 consultants and is that we sometimes 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.070
 this every invention we make with 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.170
 our sea products and kike us 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.260
 we got to surprise of everything what 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.600
 we do and all the good results 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.540
 they give there are some products that neither 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.130
 you imagine so that we use them I 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.540
 I'm hitting to make it go 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.540
 right in the shade 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.760
 and it looks nice it does not look like all the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.760
 broken it will logically be noticed that 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.970
 they are repaired but you are not going to 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.740
 lose your favorite shadow of these times 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.010
 that you have a shadow and you love 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.010
 die 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.410
 he left today is a cochinero 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.770
 clean the edges 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.270
 so you do not get dirty and it stays that way 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.700
 like a cookie if I turn it over 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.310
 in this case we are going to let it dry 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.150
 time that is required if sometimes when 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.760
 they are repairs about 10-15 minutes but 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.360
 in this case that is the whole shadow is 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.130
 let dry this because enough 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.370
 it's true that the shadow is already 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.880
 durita that's how I hope you like the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.880
 tip 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.449
 here is this month and they liked it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.340
 because this is very fast there are some 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.860
 tutorials that are for this make up 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.069
 shadows but you need alcohol of I do not know 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.520
 how many degrees and this is not too much 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:39.300
 degrees because if not there is no longer and good 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.890
 anyway then is this should not 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.850
 missing in your stem 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.000
 cosmetiquera because if it happens a 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.160
 accident but of course it is for this 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.950
 It has also been fast all kind off 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.900
 from this that when you go to 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.480
 make up and you love a shadow and what 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.820
 you want to put as eyeliner you can 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:06.750
 throw in the tapita you throw a tantito 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.460
 you wet your brush and the shadow on and with that 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.400
 you apply an eyeliner and they look 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.880
 beautiful looks stronger color this and 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.720
 good that already if they like to know it tell me 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.790
 so that you can do them a tutorial on 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.780
 that's true then while right now 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.210
 we take care to fix the shadows there 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.800
 that be good girls dance of ccoo ya 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.800
