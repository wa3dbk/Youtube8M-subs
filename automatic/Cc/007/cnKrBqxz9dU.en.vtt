00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.130 
like that
not<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.299> long<00:02:22.129> delays<00:02:23.129> but<00:02:23.610> yeah<00:02:24.330> also<00:02:25.080> you

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
not like long delays but yeah also you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.410 
not like long delays but yeah also you
want<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.860> tap<00:02:26.459> echo<00:02:26.849> not<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:28.049> sweep<00:02:28.530> echo<00:02:29.420> now

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
want it on tap echo not a sweep echo now

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.020 
want it on tap echo not a sweep echo now
uh<00:02:32.090> when<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.239> bow<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.780> guitar<00:02:34.579> it's<00:02:35.579> easiest

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
uh when you bow your guitar it's easiest

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.100 
uh when you bow your guitar it's easiest
to<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.659> it<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> top<00:02:37.079> string<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:39.599> just<00:02:39.659> get

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to do it on the top string you just get

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.140 
to do it on the top string you just get
kind<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.349> like<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> droning<00:02:40.950> sound<00:02:41.340> or<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
kind of like a droning sound or the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.680 
kind of like a droning sound or the
bottom<00:02:42.450> string<00:02:43.760> which<00:02:44.760> sounds<00:02:45.150> kind<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.599> like

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
bottom string which sounds kind of like

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.869 
bottom string which sounds kind of like
a<00:02:45.780> violin

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
a violin

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.270 
a violin
it's<00:02:47.879> hard<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.930> get<00:02:49.140> all<00:02:49.680> your<00:02:50.040> strings

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it's hard to get all your strings

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.910 
it's hard to get all your strings
because<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:52.049> bridge<00:02:52.349> isn't<00:02:54.109> curved<00:02:55.109> so<00:02:55.829> that

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because the bridge isn't curved so that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.479 
because the bridge isn't curved so that
you<00:02:56.069> get<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> strings<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:58.109> is<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
you get all of the strings like is you

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.009 
you get all of the strings like is you
can<00:02:59.640> try<00:02:59.909> but<00:03:01.970> that's<00:03:02.970> all<00:03:03.269> that's<00:03:03.599> because<00:03:03.930> I

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
can try but that's all that's because I

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.580 
can try but that's all that's because I
have<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> lot<00:03:04.319> of<00:03:04.349> delay<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.930> even<00:03:07.290> hard

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
have a lot of delay on it it's even hard

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.630 
have a lot of delay on it it's even hard
with<00:03:07.680> chords<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.129> as<00:03:11.250> full<00:03:11.459> as

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
with chords but it's not as full as

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.349 
with chords but it's not as full as
you'd<00:03:11.849> probably<00:03:11.879> like<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.599> but<00:03:13.489> um<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.579> think<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
you'd probably like it but um I think it

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.890 
you'd probably like it but um I think it
sounds<00:03:15.510> fine<00:03:15.840> personally<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.790> yeah<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.780> can

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
sounds fine personally so yeah you can

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.009 
sounds fine personally so yeah you can
either<00:03:19.109> just<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.750> what<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> lot<00:03:24.900> of

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
either just like and what a lot of

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.930 
either just like and what a lot of
people<00:03:25.230> try<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:26.160> whenever<00:03:26.579> they<00:03:26.730> move

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
people try and do is whenever they move

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.000 
people try and do is whenever they move
their<00:03:27.359> hand<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> different<00:03:28.590> note<00:03:28.739> they

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
their hand for the different note they

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.210 
their hand for the different note they
would<00:03:29.660> move<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.989> bow<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.919> different

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
would move the bow in a different

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.789 
would move the bow in a different
direction<00:03:32.989> what<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.109> really<00:03:34.349> want<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.769> just

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
direction what you really want is just

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:44.089 
direction what you really want is just
to<00:03:39.139> just<00:03:40.139> keep<00:03:40.349> moving<00:03:40.590> at<00:03:40.889> one<00:03:41.040> direction<00:03:43.099> the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
to just keep moving at one direction the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.009 
to just keep moving at one direction the
only<00:03:44.400> problem<00:03:44.790> with<00:03:44.910> bowing<00:03:45.299> your<00:03:45.449> guitar<00:03:45.750> is

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
only problem with bowing your guitar is

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.569 
only problem with bowing your guitar is
afterwards<00:03:46.879> you'll<00:03:47.879> have<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> lot<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
afterwards you'll have a lot of the

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.619 
afterwards you'll have a lot of the
rosin<00:03:50.579> because<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:50.940> gets<00:03:51.060> kind<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.269> powdery

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
rosin because it gets kind of powdery

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.270 
rosin because it gets kind of powdery
when<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.959> put<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.620> your<00:03:52.829> boat<00:03:52.919> you're

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
guitar you can also use it on like a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.300 
guitar you can also use it on like a
banjo<00:04:30.360> or<00:04:30.870> mandolin<00:04:31.620> if<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.800> want<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.160> don't

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
banjo or mandolin if you want I don't

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.240 
banjo or mandolin if you want I don't
have<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> banjo<00:04:32.849> but<00:04:33.060> uh<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.620> mandolin<00:04:35.099> and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
have a banjo but uh I'm a mandolin and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.120 
have a banjo but uh I'm a mandolin and
it's<00:04:35.970> not<00:04:36.330> going<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:36.599> sound<00:04:36.750> as<00:04:37.080> full<00:04:37.860> because

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
it's not going to sound as full because

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.860 
it's not going to sound as full because
there's<00:04:38.280> no<00:04:38.400> delay<00:04:38.729> or<00:04:38.759> effects<00:04:39.210> but<00:04:44.630> yeah<00:04:45.630> I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
there's no delay or effects but yeah I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.809 
there's no delay or effects but yeah I
think<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.319> sounds<00:04:46.770> kind<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.430> violin

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
think that sounds kind of like a violin

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.930 
think that sounds kind of like a violin
to<00:04:48.000> me<00:04:48.090> but<00:04:48.419> whatever<00:04:49.610> it's<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.669> going<00:04:50.880> to

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
to me but whatever it's not going to

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.520 
to me but whatever it's not going to
sound<00:04:51.030> this<00:04:51.210> full<00:04:51.509> though<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:52.229> dealing<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
sound this full though just dealing the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.140 
sound this full though just dealing the
