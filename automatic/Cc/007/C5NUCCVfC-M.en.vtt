now the rail you kick it watch it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.610 
now the rail you kick it watch it
cluster<00:03:08.190> bear<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.310> here

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
cluster bear in here

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.319 
cluster bear in here
it's<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:11.829> solidly<00:03:12.370> three<00:03:12.790> items<00:03:13.060> your<00:03:13.180> night

and<00:03:13.480> that's<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.590> next<00:03:14.709> step<00:03:14.970> removed<00:03:15.970> or

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
and that's the next step removed or

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.470 
and that's the next step removed or
let's<00:03:16.630> uh<00:03:17.970> one<00:03:18.970> here<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.239> should<00:03:19.359> move

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
let's uh one here it should move

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.290 
let's uh one here it should move
our<00:03:19.599> twelve<00:03:19.810> still<00:03:19.989> tear<00:03:20.280> um

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.230 

but<00:03:24.300> look<00:03:24.420> let's<00:03:24.810> forwarder<00:03:26.060> I'll<00:03:27.060> take

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
but look let's forwarder I'll take

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.170 
but look let's forwarder I'll take
the<00:03:27.360> risk<00:03:27.510> burn

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the risk burn

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.890 
the risk burn
nope<00:03:30.180> attorney<00:03:30.510> burn<00:03:30.690> bagging<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:33.780> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
nope attorney burn bagging that's the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.500 
nope attorney burn bagging that's the
next<00:03:34.020> step<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.910> take<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.970> fork<00:03:36.120> off<00:03:36.300> about<00:03:36.450> a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
next step just take a fork off about a

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.920 
next step just take a fork off about a
gearbox<00:03:37.170> here<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.940> slide<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.210> shaft<00:03:39.420> forward

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
gearbox here and slide the shaft forward

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.450 
gearbox here and slide the shaft forward
on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.500> barrel<00:03:40.770> come<00:03:40.890> on

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
on the barrel come on

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.120 
on the barrel come on
so<00:03:42.450> change<00:03:42.660> overnight<00:03:43.020> monitoring<00:03:43.950> all<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
so change overnight monitoring all the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.740 
so change overnight monitoring all the
alerts<00:03:44.250> or<00:03:44.520> make<00:03:44.640> that

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.480 

push<00:03:48.750> bearing<00:03:49.680> back<00:03:49.830> on<00:03:49.950> again<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:52.130> an<00:03:53.130> extra

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
push bearing back on again so an extra

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.530 
push bearing back on again so an extra
operation<00:03:53.730> you'll<00:03:53.940> put<00:03:54.030> down<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.210> first<00:03:54.330> clip

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
operation you'll put down the first clip

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.090 
operation you'll put down the first clip
how's<00:03:54.720> our<00:03:54.840> next<00:03:55.020> step<00:03:55.140> now<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.890> bearing

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
how's our next step now this bearing

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.060 
how's our next step now this bearing
tonight<00:03:56.370> I'll<00:03:56.880> stop<00:03:57.060> raising<00:03:57.240> nobody<00:03:57.950> put<00:03:58.950> on

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
tonight I'll stop raising nobody put on

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.600 
tonight I'll stop raising nobody put on
a<00:03:59.100> plush<00:03:59.280> desk

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
a plush desk

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.860 
a plush desk
-<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.510> same<00:04:00.750> goes<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> brisket<00:04:04.350> said<00:04:05.870> get

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
- the same goes to the brisket said get

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.260 
- the same goes to the brisket said get
the<00:04:06.959> deep<00:04:07.080> side<00:04:08.840> for<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.900> state<00:04:10.110> was<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.380> here

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
the deep side for the state was on here

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.070 
the deep side for the state was on here
they<00:04:12.270> will<00:04:12.360> catch<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.660> here<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
they will catch this here to the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.810 
they will catch this here to the
flywheel<00:04:13.890> house<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.370> next<00:04:14.520> step

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
flywheel house for next step

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.280 
flywheel house for next step
no<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.090> won't<00:04:15.209> meet<00:04:15.390> up<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.690> for<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> pen<00:04:16.170> the

no you won't meet up to for a pen the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.920 
no you won't meet up to for a pen the
gearbox<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:17.400> here<00:04:18.019> yeah<00:04:19.019> we<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.320> spot<00:04:19.530> here

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
gearbox just here yeah we the spot here

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.550 
gearbox just here yeah we the spot here
that's<00:04:21.930> one<00:04:22.140> here<00:04:24.140> looking<00:04:25.140> reverse<00:04:25.350> still

that's one here looking reverse still
there<00:04:25.770> let's<00:04:26.070> see<00:04:27.620> gearbox<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.710> easier<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:28.919> get

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
there let's see gearbox is easier to get

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:40.420 
there let's see gearbox is easier to get
back<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.960> let<00:04:31.169> us<00:04:31.200> stop<00:04:31.470> here<00:04:38.330> we're<00:04:39.330> gonna

the plus note we had 12 spanner

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.760 
the plus note we had 12 spanner
that's<00:05:10.980> next<00:05:11.220> step<00:05:12.020> so<00:05:13.020> plush<00:05:13.230> doe<00:05:13.350> Cespedes

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
that's next step so plush doe Cespedes

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.610 
that's next step so plush doe Cespedes
under<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:15.240> then<00:05:15.600> just<00:05:15.780> looking<00:05:16.020> right<00:05:16.500> around

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
under and then just looking right around

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.510 
under and then just looking right around
there<00:05:16.890> you<00:05:17.010> see<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.370> ages<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.970> bone<00:05:21.210> cuts<00:05:21.480> on

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
there you see the ages this bone cuts on

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.750 
there you see the ages this bone cuts on
you<00:05:23.520> see<00:05:23.700> this<00:05:23.790> part<00:05:24.060> here<00:05:24.270> as<00:05:25.640> same<00:05:26.640> way

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you see this part here as same way

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.960 
you see this part here as same way
overrun<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:28.040> this<00:05:29.040> is<00:05:29.160> sun's<00:05:29.310> rays<00:05:29.520> will<00:05:29.790> take

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
overrun so this is sun's rays will take

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.260 
overrun so this is sun's rays will take
up<00:05:30.090> a<00:05:30.180> touch<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:30.990> yes<00:05:31.760> 12<00:05:32.760> power<00:05:33.060> okay<00:05:33.750> drop<00:05:34.250> and

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
up a touch so yes 12 power okay drop and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.160 
up a touch so yes 12 power okay drop and
a<00:05:36.270> zigzag<00:05:36.950> manner<00:05:37.950> so<00:05:38.460> do<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.240> 1v1<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:40.020> far

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
a zigzag manner so do this 1v1 the far

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.270 
a zigzag manner so do this 1v1 the far
side<00:05:42.410> I'll<00:05:43.410> take<00:05:43.560> my<00:05:43.770> clothes<00:05:43.920> even<00:05:44.100> eight

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
make sure it's dead center and then

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.920 
make sure it's dead center and then
we'll<00:05:47.250> put<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.430> gearbox<00:05:47.730> back<00:05:47.910> in<00:05:48.000> them<00:05:50.930> so

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
we'll put the gearbox back in them so
