see<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.149> little<00:02:06.149> bit<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.329> sell-off<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.990> gold<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
see a little bit more sell-off on gold I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.639 
see a little bit more sell-off on gold I
think<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.580> next<00:02:08.940> level<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> support<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
think the next level of support and this

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
think the next level of support and this
is<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> interesting<00:02:11.099> part<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> be

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
is the interesting part is going to be

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.130 
is the interesting part is going to be
about<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> 1600<00:02:14.190> region<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> trend

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
about the 1600 region that is the trend

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.510 
about the 1600 region that is the trend
line<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:16.680> running<00:02:17.069> through<00:02:17.160> here

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
line that you see running through here

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.330 
line that you see running through here
okay<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.540> I've<00:02:18.930> been<00:02:18.989> very<00:02:19.379> interesting<00:02:20.160> what

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
okay so I've been very interesting what

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.270 
okay so I've been very interesting what
gold<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.730> going<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.879> do<00:02:21.060> around<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.660> area

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
gold is going to do around this area

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.400 
gold is going to do around this area
which<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> very<00:02:23.580> close<00:02:23.849> also<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.750> 200-day

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
which is very close also to the 200-day

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.020 
which is very close also to the 200-day
moving<00:02:25.440> average<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.310> particular<00:02:26.670> yellow

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
moving average this particular yellow

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.330 
moving average this particular yellow
line<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.780> another<00:02:28.050> key<00:02:28.440> area<00:02:28.739> support

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
line is here another key area support

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.910 
line is here another key area support
okay<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.720> we're<00:02:30.930> gonna<00:02:31.019> see<00:02:31.290> gold<00:02:31.560> coming

I<00:03:37.810> mean<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.379> is<00:03:38.560> being<00:03:38.739> tremendously<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.870> was

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
I mean this is being tremendously I was

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.500 
I mean this is being tremendously I was
expecting<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.340> 200-day<00:03:42.910> moving<00:03:42.940> average

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
expecting this 200-day moving average

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.820 
expecting this 200-day moving average
here<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.810> hold<00:03:44.019> support<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:45.069> silver<00:03:45.670> but<00:03:46.480> as

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
here to hold support on on silver but as

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.880 
here to hold support on on silver but as
we<00:03:47.830> could<00:03:47.980> see<00:03:49.200> silver<00:03:50.200> has<00:03:50.319> not<00:03:50.500> listened<00:03:50.830> to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
we could see silver has not listened to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.770 
we could see silver has not listened to
that<00:03:51.160> support<00:03:51.670> it's<00:03:51.849> just<00:03:52.090> plunge<00:03:52.510> right

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
that support it's just plunge right

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.100 
that support it's just plunge right
through<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.319> we've<00:03:54.310> actually<00:03:54.459> also<00:03:55.110> broke

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
through it and we've actually also broke

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.870 
through it and we've actually also broke
through<00:03:56.470> these<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.920> area<00:03:57.220> support<00:03:57.579> here<00:03:57.790> as

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
through these this area support here as

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.809 
through these this area support here as
well<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.720> 35<00:03:59.349> area<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.040> was<00:04:00.220> expecting

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
well so the 35 area that I was expecting

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.970 
well so the 35 area that I was expecting
on<00:04:01.060> on<00:04:01.360> silver<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.140> hold<00:04:02.440> some<00:04:02.799> kind<00:04:02.950> of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
on on silver to hold some kind of

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.580 
on on silver to hold some kind of
support<00:04:03.160> here<00:04:03.670> as<00:04:03.819> now<00:04:04.780> being<00:04:05.049> breached<00:04:05.290> so

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
support here as now being breached so

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.720 
support here as now being breached so
where<00:04:05.920> are<00:04:05.980> we<00:04:06.010> going<00:04:06.280> next

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
where are we going next

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.240 
where are we going next
well<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.959> most<00:04:08.140> obvious<00:04:08.349> key<00:04:08.890> area<00:04:09.190> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
well the most obvious key area of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.860 
well the most obvious key area of
support<00:04:09.430> for<00:04:09.970> silver<00:04:11.849> looks<00:04:12.849> to<00:04:12.970> be<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.269> 26

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
support for silver looks to be that 26

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.900 
support for silver looks to be that 26
okay<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:14.470> really<00:04:14.799> about<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.190> area<00:04:15.489> here<00:04:15.760> in

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910

fact if we just zoom out a little bit
here<00:04:17.229> okay<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:19.299> also<00:04:19.570> will<00:04:19.900> correspond<00:04:20.560> to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
here okay that also will correspond to

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.840
