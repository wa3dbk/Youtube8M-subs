simple<00:00:08.400> solution<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.120> snow<00:00:09.570> fencepost

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
simple solution to the snow fencepost

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.220 
simple solution to the snow fencepost
problem<00:00:10.769> Sophia<00:00:11.639> Dorothy<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.030> basically<00:00:12.840> in

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
problem Sophia Dorothy is basically in

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.959 
problem Sophia Dorothy is basically in
Minecraft<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:13.980> only<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.309> block<00:00:14.700> in

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
Minecraft you can only have one block in

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.490 
Minecraft you can only have one block in
one<00:00:15.330> part<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> grid<00:00:15.780> at<00:00:15.900> any<00:00:16.020> given<00:00:16.260> time

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
one part of the grid at any given time

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.070 
one part of the grid at any given time
so<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.090> place<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.510> vents<00:00:18.750> down<00:00:18.930> like

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
so when you place some vents down like

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.519 
so when you place some vents down like
this<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.010> snowy<00:00:20.340> area<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.850> instance<00:00:21.529> you're

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this in a snowy area for instance you're

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.670 
this in a snowy area for instance you're
left<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.890> these<00:00:22.980> big<00:00:23.220> blank<00:00:23.640> patches<00:00:24.680> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
left with these big blank patches you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.109 
left with these big blank patches you
can't<00:00:25.920> play<00:00:26.039> snowy<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.519> these<00:00:26.670> areas<00:00:26.970> because

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
can't play snowy in these areas because

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.849 
can't play snowy in these areas because
like<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.510> said<00:00:27.750> only<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.529> block<00:00:28.740> can

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
like I just said only one block can

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
like I just said only one block can
occupy<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.279> parts<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> grid<00:00:30.060> any<00:00:30.390> given

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
occupy these parts of the grid any given

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
occupy these parts of the grid any given
moment<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.640> solution<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.030> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
moment and here is the solution to this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
moment and here is the solution to this
problem<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.190> some

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
problem so as you can see we have some

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.310 
problem so as you can see we have some
fence<00:00:35.640> posts<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.120> snow<00:00:36.480> occupying<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> same

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
fence posts and snow occupying the same

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.369 
fence posts and snow occupying the same
block<00:00:37.700> but<00:00:38.700> don't<00:00:39.480> fret<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.870> haven't<00:00:40.200> broken

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
block but don't fret I haven't broken

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
block but don't fret I haven't broken
some<00:00:40.829> golden<00:00:41.489> rule<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> Minecraft<00:00:42.180> or

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
some golden rule of Minecraft or

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
some golden rule of Minecraft or
anything<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.780> obviously<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.950> simple

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
anything this is obviously just a simple

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
anything this is obviously just a simple
little<00:00:44.760> trick<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.559> takes

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
little trick so this actually takes

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650 
little trick so this actually takes
advantage<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.640> permanent<00:00:48.239> falling<00:00:48.480> sand

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
advantage of the permanent falling sand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
advantage of the permanent falling sand
bug<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.079> showed<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.469> day<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.489> if

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
bug that I showed the other day so if

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
bug that I showed the other day so if
you<00:00:50.610> didn't<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> basically<00:00:51.440> if<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you didn't see that basically if you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
you didn't see that basically if you
summon<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> falling<00:00:53.730> sound<00:00:53.969> riding<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.570> item

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
summon a falling sound riding on an item

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
summon a falling sound riding on an item
frame<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.350> happened<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.280> falling<00:00:56.460> sound

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
frame what happened is the falling sound

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
frame what happened is the falling sound
will<00:00:56.969> remain<00:00:57.899> falling<00:00:58.379> sand<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.829> eternity

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
will remain falling sand for eternity

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.639 
will remain falling sand for eternity
and<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> stea<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and this is what have you stea so as you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.780 
and this is what have you stea so as you
can<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.399> papi<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:04.790> occupying

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
can see the papi is actually occupying

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.310 
can see the papi is actually occupying
the<00:01:05.909> same<00:01:06.030> block<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.390> snow<00:01:06.510> block<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.140> in

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the same block as this snow block but in

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.109 
the same block as this snow block but in
reality<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.070> press<00:01:08.250> f3<00:01:08.430> you'll<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
reality if I press f3 you'll see that

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.760 
reality if I press f3 you'll see that
they're<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.510> four<00:01:09.840> entities<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.470> screen

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
they're actually four entities on screen

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
they're actually four entities on screen
so<00:01:11.010> each<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.580> actually<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.409> falling

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so each of these is actually a falling

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.270 
so each of these is actually a falling
sand<00:01:14.159> disguised<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.330> layered<00:01:15.780> snow<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:17.040> there

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
sand disguised as layered snow now there

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
sand disguised as layered snow now there
is<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> slight<00:01:17.970> issue<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
is actually a slight issue to this the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
is actually a slight issue to this the
falling<00:01:19.619> sand<00:01:19.770> doesn't<00:01:20.159> mimic<00:01:20.570> real<00:01:21.570> block

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
falling sand doesn't mimic real block

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.289 
falling sand doesn't mimic real block
perfectly<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> mean<00:01:23.759> by<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
perfectly so I mean by that is if you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.670 
perfectly so I mean by that is if you
actually<00:01:24.630> come<00:01:24.780> close<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> look<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
actually come close and you look a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
actually come close and you look a
certain<00:01:26.040> angle<00:01:26.580> you'll<00:01:27.030> actually<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
certain angle you'll actually see that

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.340 
certain angle you'll actually see that
there's<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.860> slight<00:01:29.430> line<00:01:30.350> between

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
there's a very very slight line between

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.370 
there's a very very slight line between
fake<00:01:32.070> snow<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.000> real<00:01:33.360> snow<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.049> that's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
fake snow and real snow and that's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
fake snow and real snow and that's
because<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> funny<00:01:34.979> sound<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> basically

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
because the funny sound is basically

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
because the funny sound is basically
displaying<00:01:36.119> ever<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.780> slightly<00:01:37.079> lower<00:01:37.409> than<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
displaying ever so slightly lower than a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.700 
displaying ever so slightly lower than a
regular<00:01:38.310> block<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.200> too<00:01:40.409> big<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.619> an

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
regular block so it's not too big of an

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.069 
regular block so it's not too big of an
issue<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.820> some<00:01:42.479> people<00:01:42.720> might<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> bit

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
issue but some people might be a bit

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.080 
issue but some people might be a bit
picky<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.670> an

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
picky so there is actually an

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
picky so there is actually an
alternative<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
alternative to this and here is the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
alternative to this and here is the
alternative<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
alternative so as you can see there is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.690 
alternative so as you can see there is
no<00:01:49.649> line<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
no line on this one

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.480 
no line on this one
likewise<00:01:51.689> there's<00:01:51.869> no<00:01:51.990> line<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
likewise there's no line over here and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.429 
likewise there's no line over here and
it<00:01:53.610> basically<00:01:54.210> mimics<00:01:54.570> snow<00:01:55.049> almost

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
it basically mimics snow almost

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.499 
it basically mimics snow almost
perfectly<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.790> reason<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.060> didn't<00:01:57.270> use<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
perfectly the reason I didn't use this

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.760 
perfectly the reason I didn't use this
one<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> beginning<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
one at the beginning was because this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
one at the beginning was because this
one<00:01:58.950> itself<00:01:59.340> has<00:01:59.640> an<00:01:59.790> issue<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> visual

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
one itself has an issue but not a visual

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649 
one itself has an issue but not a visual
issue<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.430> alternative<00:02:02.880> actually<00:02:03.360> uses

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
issue so the alternative actually uses

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.200 
issue so the alternative actually uses
an<00:02:03.930> old<00:02:04.079> idea<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> fire<00:02:04.920> landers<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
an old idea by the fire landers so this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
an old idea by the fire landers so this
idea<00:02:06.329> basically<00:02:06.630> consists<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
idea basically consists of you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.979 
idea basically consists of you
continuously<00:02:08.700> summoning<00:02:09.239> falling<00:02:09.539> sand<00:02:09.780> at

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
continuously summoning falling sand at

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
continuously summoning falling sand at
specific<00:02:10.440> location<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.220> giving<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.849> very

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
specific location but giving it a very

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.370 
specific location but giving it a very
very<00:02:12.180> slight<00:02:12.540> upwards

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
very slight upwards

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.190 
very slight upwards
Oshin<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:14.580> combined<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.360> time<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.930> zero

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Oshin that combined with a time of zero

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.360 
Oshin that combined with a time of zero
will<00:02:16.680> eliminate<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.790> very<00:02:18.480> very<00:02:18.720> slight

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
will eliminate the very very slight

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
will eliminate the very very slight
downwards<00:02:20.390> display<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.930> following

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
downwards display of the following

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.110 
downwards display of the following
sensor<00:02:22.410> basically<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.580> appear<00:02:23.880> as

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
sensor basically it will just appear as

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.390 
sensor basically it will just appear as
a<00:02:24.180> regular<00:02:24.990> look<00:02:25.200> now<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.920> issue<00:02:26.190> with<00:02:26.220> this

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
a regular look now the issue with this

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.040 
a regular look now the issue with this
method<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.940> you're<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.300> need<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.660> really

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
method is you're going to need a really

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.560 
method is you're going to need a really
rapid<00:02:28.530> clock<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.220> work<00:02:29.340> such<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:30.180> this

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
rapid clock for it to work such as this

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.620 
rapid clock for it to work such as this
one<00:02:30.750> over<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.800> basically<00:02:32.430> falling<00:02:33.360> sand

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
one over here but basically falling sand

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.930 
one over here but basically falling sand
has<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.320> summoned<00:02:34.560> every<00:02:35.370> tick<00:02:35.640> or<00:02:35.820> every

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
has to be summoned every tick or every

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.390 
has to be summoned every tick or every
two<00:02:36.120> ticks<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.040> need<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.190> really

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
two ticks and you can need to really

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.920 
two ticks and you can need to really
fast<00:02:38.550> look<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:38.910> work<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.510> issue<00:02:39.750> there

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
fast look for work now the issue there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.030 
fast look for work now the issue there
is<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.650> you're<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.100> get<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.610> lot<00:02:42.000> of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
is that you're going to get a lot of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.380 
is that you're going to get a lot of
redstone<00:02:44.040> update<00:02:44.430> states<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.060> that's<00:02:45.180> going

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
redstone update states and that's going

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.740 
redstone update states and that's going
to<00:02:45.480> cause<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.780> some<00:02:45.990> lack<00:02:47.180> now<00:02:48.180> I've<00:02:48.480> used

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
to cause you some lack now I've used

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.740 
to cause you some lack now I've used
this<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.230> small-scale<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:51.420> you're<00:02:51.570> going

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
this on small-scale but if you're going

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
this on small-scale but if you're going
to<00:02:51.810> use<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.620> slightly<00:02:52.950> larger<00:02:53.130> scale

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
to use this on a slightly larger scale

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.490 
to use this on a slightly larger scale
then<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.480> gonna<00:02:54.600> get<00:02:54.750> some<00:02:54.990> noticeable

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
then you're gonna get some noticeable

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.680 
then you're gonna get some noticeable
lag<00:02:55.680> which<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.790> not<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.210> be<00:02:57.270> good

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
lag which this is not going to be good

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.270 
lag which this is not going to be good
so<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.320> two<00:02:58.440> options<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.040> go<00:02:59.160> with

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
so you have two options you can go with

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.520 
so you have two options you can go with
the<00:02:59.400> permanent<00:02:59.790> falling<00:03:00.150> sand<00:03:00.420> bug<00:03:00.660> at<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the permanent falling sand bug at the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.290 
the permanent falling sand bug at the
cost<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.860> some<00:03:02.070> visuals<00:03:02.490> or<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
cost of some visuals or you can go the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.420 
cost of some visuals or you can go the
alternative<00:03:03.840> which<00:03:04.080> looks<00:03:04.430> noticeably

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
alternative which looks noticeably

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.750 
alternative which looks noticeably
better<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> cost<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.140> slag<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:08.550> it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
better but at the cost of slag so it's

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.850 
better but at the cost of slag so it's
up<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.180> both<00:03:09.870> should<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.200> used<00:03:10.530> sparingly

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
up to you both should be used sparingly

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.040 
up to you both should be used sparingly
because<00:03:11.220> remember<00:03:11.910> they<00:03:12.150> are<00:03:12.270> using<00:03:12.570> entities

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
because remember they are using entities

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.660 
because remember they are using entities
and<00:03:13.350> when<00:03:13.710> you<00:03:13.800> get<00:03:13.920> too<00:03:14.130> many<00:03:14.190> entities<00:03:14.430> on

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
and when you get too many entities on

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.590 
and when you get too many entities on
the<00:03:14.700> screen<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.420> cause<00:03:15.510> some

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the screen that's going to cause some

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.840 
the screen that's going to cause some
like<00:03:15.810> anyway<00:03:16.170> but<00:03:16.860> yeah<00:03:17.310> which<00:03:17.580> are<00:03:17.730> you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
like anyway but yeah which are you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.750 
like anyway but yeah which are you
choose<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.240> up<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.570> you
