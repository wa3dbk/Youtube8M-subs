used to be very very rusty you can see
these<00:01:14.040> keys<00:01:16.850> they<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.450> lot

just from sitting in it you can see the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.130 
just from sitting in it you can see the
rust<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.720> between<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.390> basically<00:01:30.840> used

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
rust in between and that basically used

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.450 
rust in between and that basically used
to<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.860> whole<00:01:32.070> entire<00:01:32.430> screw<00:01:33.229> i<00:01:34.460> cannot

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to be the whole entire screw i cannot

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.690 
to be the whole entire screw i cannot
have<00:01:35.909> rust<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.320> artwork<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.040> I'm

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
have rust in the artwork that I do I'm

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
have rust in the artwork that I do I'm
generating<00:01:39.439> piezoelectricity<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.759> rest

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
generating piezoelectricity and the rest

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.889 
generating piezoelectricity and the rest
not<00:01:42.479> only<00:01:42.780> dies<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:44.159> rezident<00:01:44.899> completely

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
not only dies the rezident completely

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
not only dies the rezident completely
yellow<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
yellow but it would actually have a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.050 
yellow but it would actually have a
negative<00:01:48.540> effect<00:01:49.009> because<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.460> elements

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
negative effect because of the elements

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.429 
negative effect because of the elements
that<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.329> using<00:01:51.689> rust<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:54.439> too

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that I'm using rust is actually not too

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.399 
that I'm using rust is actually not too
friendly<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:57.210> key<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
friendly this key it's like in the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.550 
friendly this key it's like in the
macula<00:01:58.680> shape<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.579> haven't<00:02:00.299> even<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:01.619> know

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
macula shape I haven't even you know

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.840 
macula shape I haven't even you know
scrub<00:02:03.550> them<00:02:03.730> down<00:02:03.760> I'm<00:02:04.210> about<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.600> use<00:02:04.630> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
scrub them down I'm about to use this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.870 
scrub them down I'm about to use this
copper<00:02:06.850> scrub<00:02:07.150> brush<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:09.160> one's<00:02:09.399> still<00:02:09.700> in

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
copper scrub brush this one's still in

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880 
copper scrub brush this one's still in
some<00:02:10.119> pretty<00:02:10.390> bad<00:02:10.929> shape<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.650> will<00:02:11.740> look

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
some pretty bad shape but it will look

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.580 
some pretty bad shape but it will look
like<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.310> other<00:02:12.430> wood<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:14.580> polish<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:16.590> so

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
like the other wood I polish it up so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.430 
like the other wood I polish it up so
just<00:02:17.860> by<00:02:18.010> letting<00:02:18.220> them<00:02:18.490> sit<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.030> mean<00:02:19.440> like

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
just by letting them sit I mean like

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.650 
just by letting them sit I mean like
look<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:20.770> this<00:02:20.890> piece<00:02:21.220> right<00:02:21.490> here<00:02:21.550> because<00:02:22.390> I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
look at this piece right here because I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.449 
look at this piece right here because I
started<00:02:23.320> scrubbing<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.130> then<00:02:24.280> that's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
started scrubbing it and then that's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.490 
started scrubbing it and then that's
when<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.760> decided<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.330> make<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.750> very<00:02:26.230> quick

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
when I decided to make this very quick

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.160 
when I decided to make this very quick
video<00:02:26.950> because<00:02:27.730> look<00:02:28.330> how<00:02:28.450> shiny<00:02:28.810> that's

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
video because look how shiny that's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.050 
video because look how shiny that's
going<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.680> make<00:02:29.830> these<00:02:29.980> look<00:02:30.190> like<00:02:30.580> give<00:02:33.060> me

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
going to make these look like give me

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.640 
going to make these look like give me
will<00:02:34.660> use<00:02:35.050> original<00:02:35.680> pieces<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.380> know<00:02:38.500> it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
will use original pieces you know it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.380 
will use original pieces you know it's
just<00:02:38.770> my<00:02:39.070> thing<00:02:39.840> my<00:02:40.840> art<00:02:41.110> has<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.440> work<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.270> if<00:02:43.270> I

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
just my thing my art has to work so if I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.870 
just my thing my art has to work so if I
get<00:02:43.450> into<00:02:43.720> plastics<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.620> things<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:45.190> really

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
basically doing using organic materials

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.210 
basically doing using organic materials
looks<00:06:12.230> like<00:06:12.380> I<00:06:12.410> just<00:06:12.530> missed<00:06:13.040> a<00:06:13.160> spot<00:06:13.340> there
