00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
don't I make an extra one which I don't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.299 
don't I make an extra one which I don't
have<00:00:50.309> room<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.809> need<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.129> many

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
have room for but I need so many

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
have room for but I need so many
accidents<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:58.430> I<00:00:59.430> got<00:01:00.329> wood<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.930> rid<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
accidents so and I got wood so rid of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:14.160 
accidents so and I got wood so rid of
the<00:01:01.800> wooden<00:01:01.949> sticks

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.530 

probably<00:01:14.920> not<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.130> good<00:01:15.400> time<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.640> actually<00:01:16.180> use

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
probably not a good time to actually use

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.490 
probably not a good time to actually use
the<00:01:16.720> boat<00:01:16.869> anyway<00:01:17.229> being<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.710> can't<00:01:18.250> see

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.109 

so<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.560> guess<00:01:26.710> I'll<00:01:26.920> just<00:01:26.950> continue<00:01:27.340> looking

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
so I guess I'll just continue looking

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.590 
so I guess I'll just continue looking
around<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.500> though<00:01:29.649> it's<00:01:29.799> nighttime<00:01:33.600> putting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
around and though it's nighttime putting

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.840 
around and though it's nighttime putting
up<00:01:34.720> some<00:01:34.930> torches<00:01:35.229> would<00:01:35.619> it's<00:01:36.430> not<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.610> bad

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
up some torches would it's not a bad

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.620 
up some torches would it's not a bad
idea<00:01:36.880> just<00:01:37.479> for<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.780> sake<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:39.479> letting<00:01:40.479> me

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
idea just for the sake of letting me

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.779 
idea just for the sake of letting me
know<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:40.930> future<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> have<00:01:42.280> been<00:01:42.549> here

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
know in the future that I have been here

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:50.930 
know in the future that I have been here
before<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:47.229> it's<00:01:47.350> such<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.500> pain<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:48.240> navigate

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940
