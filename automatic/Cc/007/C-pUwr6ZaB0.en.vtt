00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
stacked on top of it will squeeze onto

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.429 
stacked on top of it will squeeze onto
the<00:01:13.830> bottles<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.210> next<00:01:15.540> very<00:01:16.140> very

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the bottles and the next very very

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.700 
the bottles and the next very very
obvious<00:01:16.619> step<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.240> stick<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.810> velcro<00:01:18.960> onto

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
obvious step is to stick the velcro onto

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.749 
obvious step is to stick the velcro onto
the<00:01:20.369> bottom<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.049> bottles<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.759> choose

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the bottom of all the bottles I choose

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.539 
the bottom of all the bottles I choose
to<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> bottom<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.070> reason<00:01:26.369> why<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to put at the bottom the reason why is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.660 
to put at the bottom the reason why is
because<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> put<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> sign<00:01:28.340> even<00:01:29.340> though

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because if you put at a sign even though

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
because if you put at a sign even though
it's<00:01:29.909> organized<00:01:30.390> anything<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> stay<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.530> top

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it's organized anything that stay on top

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's organized anything that stay on top
of<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.310> squeeze<00:01:32.729> onto<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> bottles

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of it will squeeze onto the bottles

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.530 
of it will squeeze onto the bottles
making<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.710> spill<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.700> something

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
making it spill out or something

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.890 
making it spill out or something
so<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:38.340> choose<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> stick<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so I actually choose to stick at the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
so I actually choose to stick at the
bottom<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.939> stand<00:01:42.240> on

even not hold on to that the next that
is<00:02:26.239> very<00:02:26.540> very<00:02:26.750> simple<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.500> repeat<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> step

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
bottom of the bottles however remember

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.040 
bottom of the bottles however remember
to<00:02:36.080> space<00:02:36.380> them<00:02:36.680> wide<00:02:37.400> apart<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.840> you

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
to space them wide apart so that you

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.509 
to space them wide apart so that you
have<00:02:39.200> enough<00:02:39.350> space<00:02:39.769> when<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.310> actually

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
have enough space when you actually

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.180 
have enough space when you actually
place<00:02:41.060> onto<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> board<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.890> another

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
place onto the board that is another

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.250 
place onto the board that is another
option<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.940> buy<00:02:44.180> those<00:02:44.450> velcro<00:02:44.690> there<00:02:45.140> is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
option is to buy those velcro there is

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.650 
option is to buy those velcro there is
one<00:02:45.560> whole<00:02:45.769> strip<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.360> cover

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
one whole strip so that you can cover

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.470 
one whole strip so that you can cover
every<00:02:48.140> inch<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.860> body<00:02:49.160> itself<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.300> no

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
every inch of the body itself so that no

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.460 
every inch of the body itself so that no
matter<00:02:50.690> where<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.320> put<00:02:52.780> bottles<00:02:53.780> you'll<00:02:54.319> be

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
matter where you put bottles you'll be

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.180 
matter where you put bottles you'll be
evenly<00:02:55.160> spaced<00:02:56.200> another<00:02:57.200> way<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.470> prevent

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
evenly spaced another way to prevent

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.300 
evenly spaced another way to prevent
spillage<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.480> put<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.930> clear<00:03:00.530> plastic<00:03:00.890> at

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
spillage is to put a clear plastic at

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.840 
spillage is to put a clear plastic at
the<00:03:01.459> inner<00:03:01.730> side<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.300> bottle<00:03:02.810> cap<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.739> that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
the inner side of the bottle cap so that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.150 
the inner side of the bottle cap so that
content<00:03:04.850> will<00:03:05.300> not<00:03:05.330> spill<00:03:05.900> out<00:03:06.080> easily<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
content will not spill out easily the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.220 
content will not spill out easily the
final<00:03:07.519> step<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.150> test<00:03:08.390> whether<00:03:08.690> or<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.019> the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
final step is to test whether or not the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.400 
final step is to test whether or not the
velcro<00:03:09.410> holds<00:03:09.920> onto<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.819> bottles<00:03:11.269> firmly<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
velcro holds onto the bottles firmly and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.460 
velcro holds onto the bottles firmly and
I<00:03:13.130> think<00:03:13.489> that's<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.720> can<00:03:14.959> label<00:03:15.230> your

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
I think that's it and you can label your

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.580 
I think that's it and you can label your
portholes<00:03:16.250> using<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.000> little<00:03:17.180> marker<00:03:17.630> or<00:03:17.900> using

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
portholes using a little marker or using

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.740 
portholes using a little marker or using
a<00:03:18.769> cross<00:03:19.280> stick<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.760> printout<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
a cross stick and a printout of the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.030 
a cross stick and a printout of the
labels<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.440> stick<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.790> these<00:03:23.239> bottles

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
labels and stick it on to these bottles

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.259 
labels and stick it on to these bottles
and<00:03:25.040> basically<00:03:25.579> that's<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.850> for<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.120> video

the base couple of giant couple one with
a<00:05:02.630> spring<00:05:03.229> trap<00:05:03.409> and<00:05:03.680> about<00:05:04.190> access<00:05:05.060> to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
a spring trap and about access to

a spring trap and about access to
operators<00:05:05.870> break<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.199> t-junction<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:07.330> on

operators break the t-junction and on

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.260 
operators break the t-junction and on
the<00:05:08.479> top<00:05:08.690> left<00:05:08.990> side<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.440> attacking<00:05:10.060> very<00:05:11.060> very

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
the top left side is attacking very very

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.300 
the top left side is attacking very very
smoothly<00:05:11.569> and<00:05:11.900> now<00:05:12.199> that<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.889> believe

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
smoothly and now that I believe

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.680 
smoothly and now that I believe
this<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.719> hundred<00:05:15.500> percent<00:05:15.590> success<00:05:16.690> from

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
this is a hundred percent success from

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.330 
this is a hundred percent success from
here<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:17.930> can<00:05:18.080> see<00:05:18.289> most<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.009> resource

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
here you can see most of the resource

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.870 
here you can see most of the resource
has<00:05:19.490> been<00:05:19.520> already<00:05:19.969> taken<00:05:20.330> out<00:05:20.509> and<00:05:21.669> in<00:05:22.669> fact

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
has been already taken out and in fact

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.550 
has been already taken out and in fact
actually<00:05:23.030> even<00:05:23.509> have<00:05:23.630> deployed<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.349> any

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
actually even have deployed and any

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.649 
actually even have deployed and any
additional<00:05:25.130> troops<00:05:25.639> at<00:05:25.819> this<00:05:26.180> point<00:05:26.479> of<00:05:26.630> time

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
additional troops at this point of time

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.140 
additional troops at this point of time
but<00:05:27.139> I<00:05:27.319> just<00:05:27.530> want<00:05:27.889> to<00:05:28.219> get<00:05:28.729> 100<00:05:29.479> percent<00:05:31.150> but

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
but I just want to get 100 percent but

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.420 
but I just want to get 100 percent but
anyway<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:33.229> can<00:05:33.259> see<00:05:33.560> that<00:05:33.740> one<00:05:33.889> spring<00:05:34.190> trend

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
anyway you can see that one spring trend

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.519 
anyway you can see that one spring trend
has<00:05:34.610> been<00:05:34.940> utilized<00:05:35.479> on<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.870> top<00:05:36.050> side<00:05:36.289> which

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
has been utilized on the top side which

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.469 
has been utilized on the top side which
is<00:05:36.710> did<00:05:37.190> not<00:05:37.279> really<00:05:37.520> speed<00:05:37.759> trap<00:05:37.909> any<00:05:38.090> troops

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
is did not really speed trap any troops

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.050 
is did not really speed trap any troops
so<00:05:39.259> the<00:05:39.560> deployment<00:05:40.279> of<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.639> spring<00:05:40.819> trail<00:05:40.969> is

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
so the deployment of the spring trail is

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.480 
so the deployment of the spring trail is
a<00:05:41.180> failure<00:05:41.389> and<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:41.870> can<00:05:42.469> see<00:05:42.680> this<00:05:42.949> is<00:05:43.130> one<00:05:43.460> of

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
a failure and you can see this is one of

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.029 
a failure and you can see this is one of
the<00:05:43.610> most<00:05:43.789> amazing<00:05:44.210> battle<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:45.259> I've<00:05:45.680> ever

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
the most amazing battle that I've ever

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.930 
the most amazing battle that I've ever
ever<00:05:46.219> gotten<00:05:46.849> so<00:05:47.509> for<00:05:48.229> guys<00:05:48.440> who<00:05:48.819> claim<00:05:49.819> that

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
ever gotten so for guys who claim that

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.700 
ever gotten so for guys who claim that
there<00:05:50.240> is<00:05:50.360> no<00:05:50.539> resource<00:05:50.990> out<00:05:51.229> there<00:05:51.259> there<00:05:51.680> is

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
there is no resource out there there is

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.370 
there is no resource out there there is
resource<00:05:52.669> it's<00:05:53.240> just<00:05:53.449> that<00:05:53.630> it's<00:05:53.840> harder<00:05:54.229> to

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
resource it's just that it's harder to

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.800 
resource it's just that it's harder to
find<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:54.919> you<00:05:55.460> need<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.729> find<00:05:56.000> on<00:05:56.210> very<00:05:56.539> long

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
find and you need to find on very long

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.439 
find and you need to find on very long
