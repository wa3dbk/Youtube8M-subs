have a mother who's an artist and she
encouraged<00:00:19.830> art<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> lucky<00:00:21.660> child

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
encouraged art and I was the lucky child

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470 
encouraged art and I was the lucky child
that<00:00:22.289> figured<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.449> it<00:00:24.449> actually

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
that figured that out and it actually

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.290 
that figured that out and it actually
enrolled<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> Chicago<00:00:25.890> Art<00:00:26.130> Institute

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so I had a tremendous boost of awareness

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
so I had a tremendous boost of awareness
when<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.149> second<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.570> third

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
when I was like in second and third

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.370

I<00:01:27.020> welcome<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.490> much<00:01:29.759> harder<00:01:30.000> than

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
I welcome that but it's much harder than

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.649 
I welcome that but it's much harder than
you<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.689> ever<00:01:30.990> guess<00:01:31.590> until<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> try<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
you would ever guess until you try it

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
you would ever guess until you try it
but<00:01:33.659> once<00:01:33.869> you're<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> you're<00:01:34.890> drawing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
but once you're there and you're drawing

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420 
but once you're there and you're drawing
your<00:01:35.900> imagination<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.439> content<00:01:38.130> your

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
your imagination your content your

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.300 
your imagination your content your
philosophy<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.560> involving

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
philosophy it's it's like involving

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
philosophy it's it's like involving
something<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> heart<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.829> my

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
something but probably the heart of my

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.359 
something but probably the heart of my
real<00:01:44.460> passion<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.210> drawing<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.040> had<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
real passion is drawing if I had to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.130 
real passion is drawing if I had to
choose<00:01:47.399> between<00:01:47.670> being<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.390> painter<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> being

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
choose between being a painter and being

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
choose between being a painter and being
a<00:01:49.229> drawer<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:50.070> say<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.460> drawer<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
a drawer I would say I'm a drawer and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.050 
a drawer I would say I'm a drawer and
the<00:01:51.530> wonderful<00:01:52.530> thing<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.829> abstracts<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the wonderful thing about abstracts is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.819 
the wonderful thing about abstracts is
I've<00:01:54.360> been<00:01:54.390> able<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.930> incorporate<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
I've been able to incorporate the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.820 
I've been able to incorporate the
drawing

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
drawing

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.540 
drawing
and<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.580> undergirds<00:01:58.150> these<00:01:58.570> paintings

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
and it undergirds these paintings

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.510 
and it undergirds these paintings
there's<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.610> story<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.360> oftentimes<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:03.070> begins

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
there's a story and oftentimes it begins

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.790 
there's a story and oftentimes it begins
with<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.970> charcoal<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.840> layout<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.710> the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
with the charcoal and the layout in the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.510 
with the charcoal and the layout in the
beginning<00:02:06.240> there's<00:02:07.240> some<00:02:07.390> implied<00:02:07.780> things

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
beginning there's some implied things

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640 
beginning there's some implied things
but<00:02:09.520> maybe<00:02:09.820> they<00:02:10.119> were<00:02:10.180> what<00:02:10.780> was<00:02:10.960> meant<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
but maybe they were what was meant and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.410 
but maybe they were what was meant and
maybe<00:02:11.920> they<00:02:12.190> weren't<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.760> never<00:02:12.970> seems<00:02:13.330> to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.550 
this out is this something you map out
on<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:21.070> sketches<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.210> be<00:02:22.420> very<00:02:22.630> honest<00:02:22.990> no<00:02:23.260> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
on for sketches and be very honest no I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.310 
on for sketches and be very honest no I
like<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.460> surprises<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.870> think<00:02:26.110> that's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
like the surprises and I think that's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.940 
like the surprises and I think that's
the<00:02:26.470> advantage<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.160> doing<00:02:27.220> abstract<00:02:28.000> art<00:02:28.270> so

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the advantage of doing abstract art so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.260 
the advantage of doing abstract art so
what<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> ahead<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.640> I'm<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.060> be<00:02:31.150> doing

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
what is ahead is I'm going to be doing

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.070 
what is ahead is I'm going to be doing
more<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.130> all<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.180> us<00:02:34.540> look<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.050> a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
more of that but I all of us look for a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.170 
more of that but I all of us look for a
way<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.260> how<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> mix<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.220> realism<00:02:36.730> with

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
way to how to mix that realism with

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
way to how to mix that realism with
abstraction<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.700> fine<00:02:39.940> line<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
abstraction and it's a fine line and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.170 
abstraction and it's a fine line and
sometimes<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.010> miss<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.550> sometimes<00:02:42.760> it's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
sometimes you miss it and sometimes it's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.710 
sometimes you miss it and sometimes it's
too<00:02:43.360> contrived<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.820> one<00:02:45.820> goal<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.060> always<00:02:46.480> have

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
too contrived and one goal I always have

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.949 
too contrived and one goal I always have
is<00:02:47.020> not<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.770> be<00:02:47.950> contrived<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.970> that's<00:02:49.630> easy

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
is not to be contrived and that's easy

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.750 
is not to be contrived and that's easy
to<00:02:50.230> think<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.830> way<00:02:50.980> sometimes<00:02:51.490> with

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
to think that way sometimes with

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.630 
to think that way sometimes with
abstraction<00:02:52.240> but<00:02:53.160> we'll<00:02:54.160> see<00:02:54.370> where<00:02:54.520> that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
abstraction but we'll see where that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.730 
abstraction but we'll see where that
road<00:02:54.820> takes<00:02:55.120> me

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.800
