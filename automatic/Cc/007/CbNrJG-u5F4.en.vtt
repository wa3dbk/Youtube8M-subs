00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
thought Breaking Dawn I thought it was

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.780 
thought Breaking Dawn I thought it was
pretty<00:03:07.470> good<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.980> thought<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.250> beginning<00:03:08.550> was

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
pretty good I thought the beginning was

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.710 
pretty good I thought the beginning was
really<00:03:09.300> slow<00:03:09.980> but<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:12.030> second<00:03:12.390> half<00:03:12.480> was

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
really slow but the second half was

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.230 
really slow but the second half was
really<00:03:13.020> intense<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.580> think<00:03:15.090> one<00:03:15.210> of

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
really intense and good I think one of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.030 
really intense and good I think one of
the<00:03:15.390> reasons<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.810> liked<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:17.010> I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the reasons I liked it is because I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.710 
the reasons I liked it is because I
didn't<00:03:17.370> read<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.730> book<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.360> didn't<00:03:18.600> have

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
didn't read the book so I didn't have

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.260 
didn't read the book so I didn't have
very<00:03:18.750> high<00:03:19.200> expectations<00:03:19.640> whereas<00:03:20.640> with<00:03:20.850> the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
very high expectations whereas with the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.840 
very high expectations whereas with the
second<00:03:21.600> one<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.990> read<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.620> book<00:03:22.800> or<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.310> second

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
second one I read the book or the second

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.190 
second one I read the book or the second
and<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.000> first<00:03:24.180> one<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.420> read<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.750> book<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.110> I
