 They made an effort and I do not feel sorry 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.280

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.699
 a book that is based on wild 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.620
 erection and it's after anatot I know that 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:54.190

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.190
 hands that says I'm worth mother mother 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.179
 because it's based on direction I said 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.710
 good is a book with stories of 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.170
 action bands but I will like not 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.390
 I like the group for the time that I 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.040
 He was pleasantly surprised when he read it 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.690
 I thought I would like it so much not 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.000
 I thought I was hooking so fast 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.409
 I did not think what to read so fast I 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.600
 it's something that I really liked 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.240
 station deserved to reach my 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 little friends of planet and they are five hundred 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.100
 seventy-two pages is a bit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.600
 thick but it reads very fast is something 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.880
 that I really have to applaud the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.229
 author who is in the top and raffled 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.079
 with that is a book that you miss 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 very fast he is the first chapter and of 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.219
 suddenly five hours later you feel 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 you need more you realize and already what 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.719
 you're running out and I 'm detouring here but with 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 the world then is something very very very 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.789
 very dog ​​the way he writes 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.989
 anatole and what will be good before 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.090
 start talking about the story itself 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:50.039
 I have to clarify something I have spoken with 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.229
 several friends with strangers like 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.489
 people who have gone to 36 web is a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.970
 book that makes me very desperate 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.070
 characters are very obnoxious 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.260
 no no it's not like my electro guy 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.230
 I say good before buying the book 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.780
 look what you have to think you are not going to 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.540
 buy after a youth novel based 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.240
 in a fan fiction must is a fan fiction 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.490
 of one direction 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.800
 who wrote a girl who liked 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.720
 direction and therefore that 's history 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.530
 that is focused on a female group of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.300
 because teenage girls are willing 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.060
 to read that, yes, but it is that everything 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.819
 world was buying calm web 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.040
 that's what you're going to read and what you're going to 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.700
 reading is a romance between a bad boy 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.300
 rebel and a good girl like the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.819
 qualifications and ñoña half desperate 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.550
 that they fall in love with each other and they will put together 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.250
 a chaos for that if there are parents who 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.530
 they do very stupid things 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.700
 I feel that all those stupid things 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.130
 the talking book and everything 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.600
 odious what those characters are is what 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.580
 has happened in our daily life 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.260
 because I do not really know people like me 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.990
 of odious that we have done the same 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.600
 bullshit or worse then I feel that 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.040
 it's something that really is very good 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.750
 reflected on the part of the other because no 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.750
 it's nothing out of the ordinary of normal 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.780
 are things that really happen in that of 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.840
 true, they are possible and it is something that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.310
 he really likes everything then 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.160
 what is going to do good after is the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.780
 love story between garden and tessa 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 who are the protagonists maybe they 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.070
 it came in the direction obviously you know that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.020
 crystals gardens and tessa well this one that 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.580
 and already and fall in love then garden is a 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.770
 true son of the fuck there's no 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.040
 another word to say the ite that is 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.630
 an authentic pendeja then here goes 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.280
 the conflict that all people have with 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.020
 these two characters and that's the joke 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.540
 of creating this kind of 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.720
 characters in writing in this book that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.910
 they really make you feel something 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.160
 I 'm really reading it, that's whore 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.110
 garden is a bastard that you can not be 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.370
 so stupid but you keep reading because 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.710
 you want to know what fart with a the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.270
 story that happened that follows then that 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.920
 it is something that is very very very young 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.330
 I feel that the characters fulfill their 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.070
 objective that I feel is something for them 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.870
 that hates you know that the 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.660
 assholes that the no yes and that's 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.140
 something that I really think is worth a lot 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.300
 the anatomical highlight that really 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.459
 is the raffle good bastard with that then 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.769
 it has a lot to do with the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.540
 story and if not click on 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.220
 that it is so fast something else that 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.100
 why you see it so fast is that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.900
 chapters are very short indeed 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.060
 I loved they are chapitos cortitos a los 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.830
 that is going boom boom boom that are many 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.140
 and that there are chapters that you could eliminate 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.430
 nothing like a raisin but not fast them the 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.380
 of fast when you least realize 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.450
 period is over the book then it is something 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.500
 I liked it a lot 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.910
 this is a narration of the first book 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.420
 created in the third and the wta is that I 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.490
 is really enjoying it 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.960
 and judge us the book by its cover 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.310
 judge the book because it says it's from 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.140
 uan address and I really feel that they have 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.120
 that giving a chance is a very book 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.920
 different but I promise you that they will 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.320
 like do not despair 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.360
 quiet and as I told you they are going to read 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.670
 a story of a youthful romance between 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.800
 a good girl mensah and a bastard boy 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.390
 son of the fuck is basically is 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.280
 the drama that has art can see the 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.140
 way they write to everything is very 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.210
 realistic is things that happen all the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.370
 days that is very much worth it was 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.290
 an opportunity and this is my opinion of 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.000
 do I hope I have clarified all your 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.470
 doubts that have asked me on twitter to 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.360
 facebook and all the networks from which 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.190
