pellets all types of gram bit we've made

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690 
pellets all types of gram bit we've made
it<00:01:12.270> red<00:01:12.539> because<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.350> hits<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:13.799> water<00:01:14.009> if<00:01:14.579> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it red because it hits the water if you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.270 
it red because it hits the water if you
don't<00:01:14.819> put<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:14.969> spot<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:16.109> a<00:01:16.170> hit<00:01:16.859> so<00:01:17.009> after

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
don't put your spot as a hit so after
the<00:01:17.340> spot<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.609> upside<00:01:17.969> down<00:01:18.240> you'll<00:01:18.929> get<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.079> red

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the spot of upside down you'll get a red

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
the spot of upside down you'll get a red
cloud<00:01:19.530> coming<00:01:19.859> down<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.280> goodies

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
cloud coming down with all the goodies

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
cloud coming down with all the goodies
in<00:01:20.579> there<00:01:21.149> or<00:01:21.390> you'll<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.899> cap<00:01:22.109> snatching

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
in there or you'll get the cap snatching

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
in there or you'll get the cap snatching
away<00:01:23.069> at<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.909> maggots<00:01:24.209> bottom<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
away at the maggots bottom that's the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.190 
away at the maggots bottom that's the
idea

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.250 

Iger<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:34.210> too<00:01:34.420> much

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.220 

so<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.920> idea<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.540> cus<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.660> don't<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> turns

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
so the idea is cus I don't that turns

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.850 
so the idea is cus I don't that turns
upside<00:01:43.620> down<00:01:44.750> on<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.870> ground<00:01:46.050> bit<00:01:46.260> pallid

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
upside down on the ground bit pallid

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.540 
upside down on the ground bit pallid
swallow<00:01:47.240> fish<00:01:48.240> come<00:01:48.480> along<00:01:48.720> close<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.310> snatch

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
swallow fish come along close and snatch

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:02.980 
swallow fish come along close and snatch
the<00:01:50.730> maggot<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> idea

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.110 

and<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> go<00:02:04.229> over<00:02:04.550> hold<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
and it go over hold a little bit to the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.330 
and it go over hold a little bit to the
