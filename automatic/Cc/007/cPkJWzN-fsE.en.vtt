00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
a little bit better you know I think

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
a little bit better you know I think
this<00:02:08.269> game<00:02:08.420> would<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.720> been<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.080> lot<00:02:09.920> better<00:02:10.160> I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
this game would have been a lot better I

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.930 
this game would have been a lot better I
don't<00:02:12.950> know<00:02:13.040> where<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.220> guy<00:02:13.430> even<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> winds

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
don't know where that guy even the winds

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750 
don't know where that guy even the winds
I<00:02:14.650> can't<00:02:15.650> tell<00:02:15.800> if<00:02:15.860> he<00:02:15.980> ran<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.310> building<00:02:16.670> or

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
I can't tell if he ran the building or

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.420 
I can't tell if he ran the building or
what<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:18.170> know<00:02:18.260> if<00:02:18.530> they<00:02:18.680> had<00:02:18.799> just<00:02:18.950> done<00:02:19.160> some

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
what you know if they had just done some

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.890 
what you know if they had just done some
of<00:02:19.549> that<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.000> think<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.510> game<00:02:20.660> would<00:02:20.780> have

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
of that I think this game would have

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.660 
of that I think this game would have
been<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.140> shit<00:02:21.470> ton<00:02:21.650> better<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.370> didn't

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
been a shit ton better but they didn't

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.470 
been a shit ton better but they didn't
really<00:02:23.230> off<00:02:24.230> anything<00:02:24.620> besides<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.450> 1887<00:02:26.450> s

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
really off anything besides the 1887 s

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.740 
really off anything besides the 1887 s
and<00:02:26.920> those<00:02:27.920> were<00:02:28.100> terribly<00:02:28.760> overpowered<00:02:29.450> so

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
and those were terribly overpowered so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.300 
and those were terribly overpowered so
they<00:02:29.930> kind<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.470> had<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.920> something<00:02:31.250> about

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
they kind of had to do something about

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.960 
they kind of had to do something about
that<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.090> yeah<00:02:32.470> wow<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:34.100> they<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.549> done<00:02:34.760> some

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
that but yeah wow if they just done some

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.960 
that but yeah wow if they just done some
stuff<00:02:35.239> like<00:02:35.709> nerf<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.920> UMP<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> little<00:02:37.670> give

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
stuff like nerf the UMP a little give

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.330 
stuff like nerf the UMP a little give
the<00:02:38.090> ACR<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.570> little<00:02:38.810> bit<00:02:38.900> more<00:02:39.019> damage<00:02:40.810> awesome

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the ACR a little bit more damage awesome

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.259 
the ACR a little bit more damage awesome
Wow<00:02:44.000> ha<00:02:45.700> then<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.730> think<00:02:47.090> it'd<00:02:47.150> have<00:02:47.239> been

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
Wow ha then I think it'd have been

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.140 
Wow ha then I think it'd have been
better<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.660> know<00:02:47.780> get<00:02:48.140> rid<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.670> limit<00:02:49.670> oh<00:02:49.760> ma<00:02:50.120> a

little<00:02:50.599> bit<00:02:51.160> then<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.190> think<00:02:52.489> things<00:02:52.730> would

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
little bit then I think things would

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:59.740 
little bit then I think things would
have<00:02:53.000> been<00:02:54.129> been<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.340> little<00:02:55.550> bit<00:02:55.730> better<00:02:55.970> oh<00:02:58.750> my
