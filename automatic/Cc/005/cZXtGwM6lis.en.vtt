00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.180 

how'd<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.199> guys<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.380> figured<00:00:01.800> it's<00:00:01.949> time<00:00:02.100> to

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
how'd you guys I figured it's time to

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.999 
how'd you guys I figured it's time to
make<00:00:02.340> another<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:03.319> have<00:00:04.319> determined

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
make another video I have determined

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.040 
make another video I have determined
that<00:00:05.480> this<00:00:06.480> engine<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.020> not<00:00:07.049> gonna<00:00:07.410> run<00:00:08.120> and<00:00:09.120> I

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
that this engine is not gonna run and I

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.680 
that this engine is not gonna run and I
don't<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.280> ever<00:00:11.340> will<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:12.240> I've

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
don't think it ever will because I've

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.620 
don't think it ever will because I've
got<00:00:12.929> my<00:00:13.190> compressor<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.309> turbine<00:00:14.730> ratio<00:00:15.210> way

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
got my compressor to turbine ratio way

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.470 
got my compressor to turbine ratio way
too<00:00:15.690> far<00:00:16.020> off<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.410> compression<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:16.859> too<00:00:17.010> big

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
too far off my compression was too big

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
too far off my compression was too big
my<00:00:18.480> turbine<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.170> too<00:00:19.410> small<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:21.980> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
my turbine is too small so this is the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.540 
my turbine is too small so this is the
the<00:00:23.730> newer<00:00:23.939> design<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:24.750> come<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.140> with

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
the newer design and I've come up with

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.580 
the newer design and I've come up with
it's<00:00:26.550> almost<00:00:26.699> done

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
it's almost done

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.490 
it's almost done
one<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.830> compressor<00:00:29.340> stage<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.849> go<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
one more compressor stage to go and I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.130 
one more compressor stage to go and I
think<00:00:31.800> that'll<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.489> maybe<00:00:33.239> two<00:00:33.570> more<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
think that'll be it maybe two more I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.610 
think that'll be it maybe two more I
don't<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:35.010> we'll<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.960> pretty<00:00:36.960> difficult<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
don't know we'll see pretty difficult to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.209 
don't know we'll see pretty difficult to
build<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:39.239> moving<00:00:39.510> parts<00:00:40.219> together

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
build all these moving parts together

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
build all these moving parts together
without<00:00:41.940> touching<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> tolerances<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
without touching and the tolerances be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
without touching and the tolerances be
very<00:00:44.340> tight<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> stage<00:00:48.360> 2<00:00:48.690> as

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
very tight you see this is stage 2 as

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
very tight you see this is stage 2 as
you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> stator<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you can see here and then the stator in

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can see here and then the stator in
between<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.180> I've<00:00:57.300> built<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:58.800> there's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
between that I've built and then there's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
between that I've built and then there's
a<00:00:59.660> another<00:01:00.660> stage<00:01:01.760> inside<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.120> actually

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a another stage inside of there actually

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.039 
a another stage inside of there actually
yeah<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.979> sticking<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
yeah it is sticking out now and then the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.429 
yeah it is sticking out now and then the
stator<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> last<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:15.020> I'm<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.409> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
stator the last one I'm not good with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
stator the last one I'm not good with
the<00:01:16.619> terminology<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.759> gonna<00:01:17.850> have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the terminology here but I'm gonna have

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:30.480 
the terminology here but I'm gonna have
the<00:01:18.150> engine<00:01:18.390> orders<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.859 

and<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:31.180> all<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:33.299> slides<00:01:34.299> down<00:01:34.510> inside

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
and then all of this slides down inside

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.190 
and then all of this slides down inside
of<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:37.299> slot<00:01:37.600> here's<00:01:37.930> with<00:01:38.080> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
of this this is the slot here's with the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.820 
of this this is the slot here's with the
fuel<00:01:38.470> lines<00:01:39.330> slide<00:01:40.330> along<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.930> fuel<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.409> the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
fuel lines slide along the fuel and the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.580 
fuel lines slide along the fuel and the
igniter<00:01:42.600> slide<00:01:43.600> down<00:01:43.840> through<00:01:44.080> here<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.500> then

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
igniter slide down through here and then

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.960 
igniter slide down through here and then
once<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.860> get<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.220> there<00:01:45.490> I'll<00:01:46.180> have<00:01:47.970> some

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
once I get that there I'll have some

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.649 
once I get that there I'll have some
kind<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.149> little<00:01:52.360> bit<00:01:52.479> wider

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
kind of very just a little bit wider

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.990 
kind of very just a little bit wider
than<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.259> slit<00:01:53.619> itself<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.280> piece<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.640> metal

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
than the slit itself a piece of metal

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.960 
than the slit itself a piece of metal
that's<00:01:55.259> slightly<00:01:56.259> concave<00:01:56.729> I'll<00:01:57.729> probably

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
that's slightly concave I'll probably

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.090 
that's slightly concave I'll probably
drill<00:01:58.300> holes<00:01:58.570> all<00:01:59.140> along<00:01:59.590> here<00:01:59.800> and<00:01:59.920> put<00:02:00.070> some

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
drill holes all along here and put some

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.880 
drill holes all along here and put some
very<00:02:00.580> short<00:02:01.500> screws<00:02:04.289> screws<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.470> there<00:02:05.619> but<00:02:05.800> I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
very short screws screws in there but I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.520 
very short screws screws in there but I
have<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.720> quarter<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.780> an<00:02:07.899> inch<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.380> material

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
have a quarter of an inch of material

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.190 
have a quarter of an inch of material
it'll<00:02:09.039> go<00:02:09.160> through<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> should<00:02:10.959> be<00:02:11.050> able<00:02:11.110> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
it'll go through so I should be able to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500 
it'll go through so I should be able to
put<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> screw<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:13.000> hold<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.330> piece

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
put a screw in that to hold that piece

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.860 
put a screw in that to hold that piece
in<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:13.989> without<00:02:15.209> disturbing<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.420> any<00:02:16.690> of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
in there without disturbing and any of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.100 
in there without disturbing and any of
the<00:02:16.930> internal<00:02:17.320> workings<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.900> time<00:02:20.080> I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
the internal workings so this time I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.530 
the internal workings so this time I
built<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.650> linear<00:02:21.010> combustion<00:02:21.880> chamber<00:02:22.269> just<00:02:22.300> a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
built a linear combustion chamber just a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.290 
built a linear combustion chamber just a
single<00:02:22.959> one<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.800> last<00:02:24.010> time<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> had<00:02:24.489> multiple

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.800 

that's<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> old<00:02:28.600> ones<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:30.420> had<00:02:31.420> something<00:02:31.780> like

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that's the old ones I had something like

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.840 
that's the old ones I had something like
this<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:34.079> they<00:02:35.079> did<00:02:35.380> not<00:02:35.590> work<00:02:35.890> actually

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
this but they did not work actually

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.199 
this but they did not work actually
worked<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.560> uh<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> said<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> problem<00:02:39.850> I

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
worked but uh like I said the problem I

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.590 
worked but uh like I said the problem I
think<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:41.950> turbine<00:02:42.340> was<00:02:42.519> too<00:02:42.730> small<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.329> the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
think is my turbine was too small on the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.360 
think is my turbine was too small on the
air<00:02:43.750> was<00:02:44.049> being<00:02:44.320> compressed<00:02:44.769> all<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.250> way<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
air was being compressed all the way to

air was being compressed all the way to
the<00:02:45.519> point<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.910> exit<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:48.100> know<00:02:48.250> that's

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the point of exit and you know that's

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.650 
the point of exit and you know that's
not<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.820> way<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.120> should<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.450> should<00:02:49.630> be

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
not the way it should be should be

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.630 
not the way it should be should be
compressed<00:02:50.230> all<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.709> way<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.100> point<00:02:51.310> of

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
compressed all the way to the point of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.539 
compressed all the way to the point of
the<00:02:52.000> combustion<00:02:52.390> chamber<00:02:52.959> were<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.190> ignite<00:02:54.190> in

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
the combustion chamber were to ignite in

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.560 
the combustion chamber were to ignite in
it<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.850> create<00:02:55.150> even<00:02:55.390> more<00:02:55.600> pressure<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:57.570> you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it you create even more pressure and you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.759 
it you create even more pressure and you
know<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.780> don't<00:02:58.900> need<00:02:59.019> me<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.200> explain<00:02:59.620> this

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
know you don't need me to explain this

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.000 
know you don't need me to explain this
to<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:01.950> hopefully<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.519> design<00:03:03.910> work

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
to you hopefully this this design work

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.340 
to you hopefully this this design work
still<00:03:06.010> got<00:03:06.160> ways<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.549> go<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.870> rest<00:03:08.079> of

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
still got ways to go this is the rest of

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.990 
still got ways to go this is the rest of
it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.810 
it
will<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.390> there<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.430> that's<00:03:12.430> kind<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.700> what

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
will go on there and that's kind of what

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.710 
will go on there and that's kind of what
it'll<00:03:13.000> look<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:15.120> let's<00:03:16.120> see<00:03:16.269> oh<00:03:16.299> I'll<00:03:16.600> let

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
it'll look like let's see oh I'll let

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.510 
it'll look like let's see oh I'll let
you<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.170> turbine

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.990 

I<00:03:22.140> profiled<00:03:23.140> all<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.800> hand<00:03:24.460> had<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.790> hand

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
I profiled all the a hand had to hand

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.530 
I profiled all the a hand had to hand
cut<00:03:25.240> it<00:03:25.480> but<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.530> profiled<00:03:27.280> all<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:28.510> a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
cut it but I profiled all of the with a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.490 
cut it but I profiled all of the with a
dremel<00:03:28.930> tool<00:03:29.140> all<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.850> blades<00:03:31.380> except<00:03:32.380> for

dremel tool all the blades except for
the<00:03:32.560> stator<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:34.000> here<00:03:34.270> at<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.420> front<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.930> didn't

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
the stator up here at the front I didn't

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.750 
the stator up here at the front I didn't
do<00:03:35.260> anything<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.770> you<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:39.040> can<00:03:39.160> barely<00:03:39.580> see

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
do anything to you so you can barely see

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.970 
do anything to you so you can barely see
the<00:03:39.880> slot<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.420> fire<00:03:41.140> axe<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.530> comes<00:03:41.770> out

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the slot with a fire axe that comes out

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.510 
the slot with a fire axe that comes out
uh<00:03:45.480> we'll<00:03:46.480> see
