basically your building right now for

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.170 
basically your building right now for
2012<00:01:50.799> yeah<00:01:51.220> we're<00:01:51.400> building<00:01:51.549> 2012<00:01:52.150> first<00:01:54.180> so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
2012 yeah we're building 2012 first so

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.100 
2012 yeah we're building 2012 first so
we're<00:01:55.270> ending<00:01:55.360> what<00:01:55.540> you<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.720> at<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:55.900> point

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
we're ending what you get at this point

you've almost finished yet we're almost
finished<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:59.380> they<00:01:59.409> do<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.250> assembler

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
finished what they do is the assembler

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.070 
finished what they do is the assembler
stack<00:02:00.940> them<00:02:01.119> on<00:02:01.180> these<00:02:01.299> carts<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.780> bring<00:02:01.960> them

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
stack them on these carts you bring them

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.230 
stack them on these carts you bring them
out<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> watch<00:02:02.560> area<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.909> they<00:02:04.030> run

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
out to the watch area and they run

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.430 
out to the watch area and they run
through<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.720> after<00:02:04.990> they<00:02:05.110> come<00:02:05.259> out<00:02:05.380> of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
through here and after they come out of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.870 
through here and after they come out of
the<00:02:05.530> wash<00:02:05.680> then<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.009> put<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> bearings<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.790> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the wash then we put the bearings in the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.180 
the wash then we put the bearings in the
decals<00:02:07.319> they<00:02:08.319> put<00:02:08.530> them<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> plastic<00:02:08.920> bag

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
decals they put them in a plastic bag

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.900 
decals they put them in a plastic bag
and<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:10.420> stack<00:02:10.690> them<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:10.989> boxes<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
and we stack them in boxes this is the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.120 
and we stack them in boxes this is the
last<00:02:13.090> check<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:14.020> do<00:02:14.140> basically

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
last check this is what we do basically

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.740 
last check this is what we do basically
they'll<00:02:15.400> fit<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> box<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.600> two

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
they'll fit in the box for up to two

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.840 
they'll fit in the box for up to two
weeks<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:17.739> bring<00:02:17.980> them<00:02:18.100> back<00:02:18.190> add<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:18.580> poem

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
weeks they bring them back add your poem
