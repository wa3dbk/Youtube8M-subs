00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello dear friends take it off 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.639
 an unusual video for me is that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.740
 is in my closet 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:19.220
 refrigerated in our house 2 refrigerators 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.949
 one in which 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.970
 bouquets half a year and a second more 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.740
 tested freezer cabinet 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.920
 which is probably more in a dream can 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.510
 be ten years old is called his mark 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 pipe 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:44.899
 Carry Stinol as you saw, and at one and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 friend we have no magnets 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.460
 before, where do we come from? 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.520
 well then sometime I read that 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 magnets are not desirable to have their 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 place on the fridge because magnet 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.979
 and the word magnet is clear that there is 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 magnet magnet is a magnetic field 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 magnetic field was written valid 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.470
 negatively on those products that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.530
 are in the freezer or in the fridge 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.880
 so we don’t have them, for example, I think 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.909
 what could be the reason for this 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 so say 12 magnet may not 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.530
 hurt if they attach to them 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.939
 some little note some kind of recipe 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 some kind of reminder 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.869
 but if they completely cover the top 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.810
 to the bottom maybe it's not even beautiful 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.810
 I know that in short, we don’t have it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 fridge mind we have almost almost 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.409
 Well, not filled Well, if so look 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.689
 the most necessary 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:59.899
 the most necessary here in general can 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:04.170
 to be empty why because we don't have 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:09.020
 such a habit of buying products such 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.550
 somewhere in some boxes and 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.980
 packs jars and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.830
 maybe we just are not used even in 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.410
 youth when the children were small we 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.920
 never bought any mashed any 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.790
 deadlines 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.470
 everyone did it themselves frayed and then 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.760
 so therefore this habit is 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.860
 missing now 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.910
 and I think for example the same if 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.500
 there is meat better cooked with it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.020
 buy fresh now there is such 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.550
 opportunity and cook fresh than 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.209
 buy a lot of goin it all in 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.800
 freezer cabinet then defrost and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.690
 use again that is well it personally 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.209
 I showed you my opinion 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.990
 fridge well now freezer 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.230
 down there it's basically what 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.360
 now as if at hand what 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.750
 you need what we already have 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:12.520
 let's say forced that we have adjusted the mind 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 and no matter how the service and time I now 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.550
 pulled from the fridge and about an hour for 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.280
 6 all this will unfreeze and in the evening I 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.370
 fire this fish or 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.190
 or pulled you for example beet beet 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.150
 Well, this is my day before yesterday, and I will break it 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.690
 do with her 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.940
 with such a crap for rights and well 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.140
 freezer cabinets me some 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.549
 subscribers asked why are you so much 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.769
 freeze 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.970
 freeze first what is our 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.880
 there is a place in the second second we 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
 use it 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.160
 in winter and not only for myself if i go 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.820
 somewhere guests I will definitely take with 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.489
 a frozen some fruit if 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.010
 I know that a person or even vegetables 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.989
 if people do not have but it's 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:14.190
 freezer designed for 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.190
 we have 20 to 200 liters 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.959
 it's full now we are now 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.690
 we try to make compote for it though 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.660
 you can eat your own grapes but we 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.010
 we try to cook compote but because 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.000
 filled on the street for almost a day now 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.430
 it rains 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.550
 if there are mushrooms then here we are 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.340
 freeze more mushrooms and boil them 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.280
 if porcini mushrooms toomai autumn 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.030
 boil and freeze that's what 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:56.130
 the only thing we have with meat is this 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:59.740
 defect stuffed mushrooms on i'm her 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.530
 the status of raspberry I tore from already and and 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.330
 handed the freezer because well if we 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.070
 do not believe that a little bit like this 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.100
 freeze this door has already broken off 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.630

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.630

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:46.530
 this is a mushroom bag we have apricots and there 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.530
 down below 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.110
 Mulberry's a freezer at 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:59.919
 we are now full September 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:04.200
 of course yes, inclusive until May 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:07.660
 this is a lot of month we will of course 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.310
 we will make and compotes 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.310
 consume that's 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.930
 I rarely say that we are rarely very 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.430
 we buy exotic fruits in the winter to us 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.700
 just do not want us very rarely 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:27.160
 buy oranges and tangerines well, just 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.470
 even we can sometimes buy crabs crabs 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.140
 smell for the sake of having something 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.100
 put a vase 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:38.940
 attacks on how would we just do it 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.750
 enough 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:47.530
 all I wanted to show you and say 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:51.760
 your attitude to this here if 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.970
 Do you have any doubts? 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:59.290
 you can argue with me 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:03.330
 I'll listen to you all with pleasure 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.330
