00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
today now I've gone through quite a bit

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.840 
today now I've gone through quite a bit
of<00:01:29.970> dismantling<00:01:30.720> him<00:01:31.040> over<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> past<00:01:32.369> two

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
of dismantling him over the past two

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940 
of dismantling him over the past two
weeks<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.390> all<00:01:33.509> started<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.590> front

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
weeks it all started with the front

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.950 
weeks it all started with the front
subframe<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> big<00:01:36.479> monster<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
subframe which is the big monster to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
subframe which is the big monster to
take<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> bad

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
take out not really that that bad

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.300 
take out not really that that bad
actually

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
actually

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
actually
and<00:01:41.329> which<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.600> was<00:01:42.720> upgraded<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:44.040> some

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and which I think was upgraded at some

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.950 
and which I think was upgraded at some
point<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.299> got<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:48.720> two

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
point because it's got the the two

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.429 
point because it's got the the two
single<00:01:49.560> bolt<00:01:49.740> mounting<00:01:50.340> points<00:01:51.290> which<00:01:52.290> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
single bolt mounting points which is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
single bolt mounting points which is
nice<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:53.399> little<00:01:54.390> bit<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:54.659> tighter

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
nice a little bit more tighter

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.109 
nice a little bit more tighter
responsive<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> rubber<00:01:56.009> mounts<00:01:56.369> but

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
responsive on the rubber mounts but

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.800 
responsive on the rubber mounts but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
back on the road because I do miss

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.140 
back on the road because I do miss
driving<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.170> car<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.670> then<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.910> started

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
driving this car and then you started

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.630 
driving this car and then you started
stripping<00:02:25.330> down<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.599> lot<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.930> parts<00:02:26.640> not

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
stripping down a lot of the parts not

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.100 
stripping down a lot of the parts not
really<00:02:27.970> finding<00:02:28.239> anything<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:28.690> major

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
really finding anything really major

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.589 
really finding anything really major
right<00:02:29.440> now<00:02:29.610> obviously<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> engine<00:02:31.090> bay<00:02:31.269> is

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
right now obviously the engine bay is

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.110 
right now obviously the engine bay is
one<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.110> key<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.650> really<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.910> really

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
one of the key is I really is is really

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.229 
one of the key is I really is is really
pushing<00:02:34.480> me<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.660> do<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.470> right<00:02:35.680> way<00:02:36.239> and

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
pushing me to do this the right way and

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.240 
pushing me to do this the right way and
you<00:02:37.390> can<00:02:37.540> see<00:02:37.720> there's<00:02:37.930> some<00:02:38.170> old<00:02:38.319> rust

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you can see there's some old rust

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.949 
you can see there's some old rust
surface<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.209> us<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.420> hear<00:02:40.540> hopefully<00:02:40.840> it's

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
surface for us to hear hopefully it's

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.800 
surface for us to hear hopefully it's
surface<00:02:41.260> rust<00:02:41.550> from<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:45.040> old<00:02:45.510> brake<00:02:46.510> and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
surface rust from the old brake and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.449 
surface rust from the old brake and
clutch<00:02:46.840> masters<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.769> send<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.250> side

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
clutch masters that you send this side

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.180 
clutch masters that you send this side
when<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> was<00:02:49.000> right<00:02:49.330> hand<00:02:49.510> drive<00:02:50.190> converted

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
when it was right hand drive converted

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.520 
when it was right hand drive converted
over<00:02:51.280> here<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:52.239> right<00:02:52.780> hand<00:02:52.810> for<00:02:53.319> left

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
over here on the right hand for left

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.449 
over here on the right hand for left
hand<00:02:53.709> drive<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:55.739> yeah<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:56.950> think<00:02:57.040> that's<00:02:57.250> about

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
hand drive and yeah I think that's about

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.809 
hand drive and yeah I think that's about
it<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.709> wiring<00:02:59.709> loom<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.040> next<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:00.610> going

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
it so wiring loom is next it's going

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.309 
it so wiring loom is next it's going
along<00:03:00.910> really<00:03:01.150> well<00:03:01.269> I've<00:03:01.660> got<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.989> all<00:03:02.080> kind

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.030 
little worried about it because it's a
little<00:04:21.870> bit<00:04:21.990> rusty<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.560> I'm<00:04:22.650> not<00:04:22.800> sure<00:04:22.980> if

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
little bit rusty and I'm not sure if

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.040 
little bit rusty and I'm not sure if
I'll<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.400> replace<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.730> or<00:04:24.000> not<00:04:24.150> but<00:04:24.900> we

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
I'll have to replace that or not but we

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.420 
I'll have to replace that or not but we
will<00:04:25.140> soon<00:04:25.500> find<00:04:25.920> out<00:04:27.110> this<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.590> heater

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
will soon find out this is the heater

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.830 
will soon find out this is the heater
that<00:04:29.550> was<00:04:29.820> having<00:04:30.090> an<00:04:30.150> issue<00:04:30.240> with<00:04:30.450> it<00:04:30.720> would

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
that was having an issue with it would

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.830 
that was having an issue with it would
work<00:04:31.020> fine<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.440> just<00:04:31.770> blowing<00:04:32.600> circulate<00:04:33.600> air

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
work fine for just blowing circulate air

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.320 
work fine for just blowing circulate air
for<00:04:34.140> circulating<00:04:35.130> air<00:04:35.370> but<00:04:35.550> would<00:04:35.790> not<00:04:36.060> power

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
for circulating air but would not power

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.430 
for circulating air but would not power
on<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.870> have<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.170> suspicion<00:04:38.990> this<00:04:39.990> may<00:04:40.380> be

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
on and I have a suspicion this may be

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.730 
on and I have a suspicion this may be
the<00:04:40.710> cause<00:04:40.920> because<00:04:42.260> grounds<00:04:43.260> usually<00:04:43.590> have

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
the cause because grounds usually have

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.710 
the cause because grounds usually have
issues<00:04:44.130> when<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:44.580> not<00:04:44.790> properly<00:04:45.210> grounded

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
issues when it's not properly grounded

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.050 
issues when it's not properly grounded
thus<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.710> motor<00:04:46.890> doesn't<00:04:47.100> work<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:47.550> what<00:04:47.940> the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
thus the motor doesn't work but what the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.700 
thus the motor doesn't work but what the
heck<00:04:48.210> do<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.390> do<00:04:48.540> I'll<00:04:48.930> find<00:04:49.170> out<00:04:49.260> when<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.470> get<00:04:49.530> in

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
heck do I do I'll find out when I get in

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.580 
heck do I do I'll find out when I get in
there<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:51.180> bonnet<00:04:51.570> sorry<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.260> boot<00:04:52.440> was

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
taken care of last week and pretty

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.350 
taken care of last week and pretty
impressive<00:04:55.140> that<00:04:55.440> everything<00:04:55.770> kind<00:04:55.980> of

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
impressive that everything kind of

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.090 
impressive that everything kind of
worked<00:04:57.360> out<00:04:57.540> okay

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
worked out okay

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.200 
worked out okay
again<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:01.400> window<00:05:02.400> was<00:05:02.520> taken<00:05:02.790> out<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:02.940> I'm

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
again the window was taken out and I'm

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.460 
again the window was taken out and I'm
just<00:05:03.240> trying<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.660> pull<00:05:03.840> some<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.170> ceiling

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
just trying to pull some of the ceiling

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.060 
just trying to pull some of the ceiling
right<00:05:04.620> now<00:05:06.050> finding<00:05:07.050> some<00:05:07.200> really<00:05:07.350> odd<00:05:07.590> things

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
right now finding some really odd things

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.130 
right now finding some really odd things
that<00:05:08.850> was<00:05:09.000> done<00:05:09.180> previously<00:05:09.390> as<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.810> can<00:05:09.990> see

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
that was done previously as you can see

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.430 
that was done previously as you can see
in<00:05:10.260> one<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.560> my<00:05:10.680> reports<00:05:12.140> there<00:05:13.140> were<00:05:13.260> some

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
in one of my reports there were some

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.840 
in one of my reports there were some
screws<00:05:13.770> here<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.190> were<00:05:14.280> actually<00:05:14.340> taped

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
screws here that were actually taped

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.080 
screws here that were actually taped
over<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:16.160> to<00:05:17.160> hold<00:05:17.370> them<00:05:17.490> in<00:05:17.610> place<00:05:17.640> as<00:05:18.030> you

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
over but to hold them in place as you

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.600 
over but to hold them in place as you
can<00:05:18.210> see<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.450> residue<00:05:18.750> but<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.110> digress<00:05:19.610> and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
can see the residue but I digress and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.290 
can see the residue but I digress and
anyway<00:05:21.240> so<00:05:21.270> that's<00:05:21.630> pretty<00:05:22.200> much<00:05:23.210> basil<00:05:24.210> from

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
anyway so that's pretty much basil from

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.660 
anyway so that's pretty much basil from
a<00:05:24.420> standpoint<00:05:24.720> now<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:26.100> just<00:05:26.460> thought<00:05:26.520> it'd<00:05:26.640> be

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
a standpoint now I just thought it'd be

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.100 
a standpoint now I just thought it'd be
kind<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:27.000> cool<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.210> do<00:05:27.420> one<00:05:27.540> of<00:05:27.570> these<00:05:27.690> every<00:05:27.750> so

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
kind of cool to do one of these every so

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.880 
kind of cool to do one of these every so
often<00:05:28.290> where<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.160> can<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.720> just<00:05:31.350> get<00:05:31.500> an<00:05:31.590> update

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
often where I can and just get an update

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.350 
often where I can and just get an update
