00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
samples but I think actually it's a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.370 
samples but I think actually it's a
little<00:01:12.330> bit<00:01:12.540> better<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.260> your

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
little bit better if you just have your

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.320 
little bit better if you just have your
own<00:01:13.439> website<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.549> name<00:01:14.760> or

own website if you can get your name or

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
own website if you can get your name or
your<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.640> business

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
your you know your your your business

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330
