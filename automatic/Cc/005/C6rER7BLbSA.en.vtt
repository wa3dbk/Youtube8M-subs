00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
too many techniques to the dishes

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.920 
too many techniques to the dishes
because<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.260> produce<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.880> for<00:02:15.600> instance

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
because of the produce so for instance

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.750 
because of the produce so for instance
right<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> dish<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> menu<00:02:17.580> we

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
right now we have a dish on the menu we

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.150
