like<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.489> did<00:03:17.640> with<00:03:17.849> stool<00:03:18.209> stool<00:03:18.959> spot<00:03:19.349> with<00:03:19.560> me

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
like I did with stool stool spot with me

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.869 
like I did with stool stool spot with me
like<00:03:19.860> I'm<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.370> your<00:03:20.400> chest<00:03:20.700> or

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
like I'm in your chest or

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.520

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
something which I don't into that but I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.500 
something which I don't into that but I
guess<00:03:22.829> if<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.430> are<00:03:23.579> into<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.120> that's<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
guess if you are into that then that's a

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.300 
guess if you are into that then that's a
that's<00:03:24.900> um<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.470> get<00:03:25.590> splat<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.160> could

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
that's um you can get splat that could

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.830 
that's um you can get splat that could
be<00:03:26.370> something<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.879> and<00:03:27.090> then<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:27.720> got

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
be something for you and then you got

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.190 
be something for you and then you got
like<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.989> playercard<00:03:28.640> AK<00:03:29.640> background<00:03:30.239> there's

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
like a playercard AK background there's

know<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.049> just<00:03:40.620> started<00:03:40.920> an<00:03:41.040> Atlantic<00:03:41.430> Division

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
know I just started an Atlantic Division

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.339 
know I just started an Atlantic Division
and<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.269> kind<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.480> working<00:03:42.660> my<00:03:42.870> way<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:43.049> I'm

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
and I'm kind of working my way up I'm

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.349 
and I'm kind of working my way up I'm
trying<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.560> go<00:03:43.680> bronze<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.250> platinum<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.849> each

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
trying to go bronze to platinum in each

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.580 
trying to go bronze to platinum in each
division<00:03:45.569> before<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.139> jump<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.560> next

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
division before I jump to the next

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.289 
division before I jump to the next
division<00:03:47.010> instead<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:47.639> going<00:03:47.880> bronze<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
division instead it's going bronze I

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.420 
division instead it's going bronze I
guess<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.810> probably<00:03:48.989> should<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.349> go<00:03:49.470> get<00:03:50.280> all
