00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
into any kind of game genre what are the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
into any kind of game genre what are the
difference<00:01:07.500> between<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> moves<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> the

difference between the moves and the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
difference between the moves and the
wiimotes<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.900> biggest<00:01:10.170> difference<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.619> we

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
wiimotes the biggest difference is we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
wiimotes the biggest difference is we
have<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.280> precise<00:01:11.850> information<00:01:12.390> about

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have really precise information about

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
have really precise information about
where<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.500> controller<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.100> your<00:01:14.220> hand

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
where the controller is in your hand

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
where the controller is in your hand
that<00:01:14.970> gives<00:01:15.119> us<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.390> whole<00:01:15.570> different<00:01:15.960> range<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that gives us a whole different range of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
that gives us a whole different range of
experiences<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.070> able<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
experiences we can able so the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
experiences we can able so the
PlayStation<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.960> also<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> part<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> moon

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
PlayStation I also is part of the moon

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
PlayStation I also is part of the moon
system<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.509> you're<00:01:21.630> doing

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
system so it can see what you're doing

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
system so it can see what you're doing
with<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.049> body<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.490> combine<00:01:23.850> us

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
with your body as well so we combine us

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
with your body as well so we combine us
a<00:01:24.150> controller<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.290> hand<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
a controller in your hand with the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
a controller in your hand with the
camera

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
camera

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.200 
camera
the<00:01:28.170> way<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.979> system<00:01:29.340> most<00:01:29.640> games<00:01:29.939> work

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the way the the system most games work

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.340 
the way the the system most games work
is<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:30.539> you<00:01:30.600> first<00:01:30.810> turn<00:01:31.020> onto<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
is when you first turn onto the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.219 
is when you first turn onto the
controller<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.460> start<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> flash<00:01:33.539> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
controller and it start to flash you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
controller and it start to flash you
need<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> point<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> put<00:01:35.219> PlayStation<00:01:35.909> Eye

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
need to point it a put PlayStation Eye

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
need to point it a put PlayStation Eye
and<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.299> being<00:01:39.539> trapped<00:01:39.869> by<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and now it's being trapped by the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770 
and now it's being trapped by the
PlayStation<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> tracks<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.539> all<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
PlayStation so it tracks in all the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
PlayStation so it tracks in all the
different<00:01:43.079> dimensions<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.679> can<00:01:43.860> move<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
different dimensions I can move it in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.050 
different dimensions I can move it in
and<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.539> can<00:01:45.810> rotate<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:47.060> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and out I can rotate it this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
and out I can rotate it this
demonstration<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.840> particular<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
demonstration in particular we have it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.389 
demonstration in particular we have it
combined<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.700> 3d<00:01:51.240> display<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.679> this<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
combined with 3d display so this is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.850 
combined with 3d display so this is
already<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.939> compelling<00:01:54.569> fun<00:01:55.170> demonstration

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
already a compelling fun demonstration

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
already a compelling fun demonstration
but<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.189> put<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> 3d<00:01:56.850> glasses<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
but when you put on the 3d glasses you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.300 
but when you put on the 3d glasses you
can<00:01:58.049> reach<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> sword<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> know

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
can reach in with a sword and know

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
can reach in with a sword and know
exactly<00:01:59.599> where<00:02:00.599> the<00:02:00.780> tip<00:02:00.929> of<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.170> sword<00:02:01.380> is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
exactly where the tip of the sword is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.919 
exactly where the tip of the sword is
compared<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.310> character<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.209> it's<00:02:03.689> good

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
compared to the character so it's good
