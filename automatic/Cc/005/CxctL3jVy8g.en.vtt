you could just leave that alone and make

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.990 
you could just leave that alone and make
it<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.370> base<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.969> HQ<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it like a base like HQ so you want to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
it like a base like HQ so you want to
switch<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.539> around<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
switch these two around because this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.090 
switch these two around because this
blue<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.939> your<00:01:06.270> orange<00:01:06.869> piece<00:01:07.080> goes<00:01:07.830> over

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
blue and your orange piece goes over

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.530 
blue and your orange piece goes over
here<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> switch<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.479> two

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
here so I want to switch these two

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.710 
here so I want to switch these two
around<00:01:09.930> okay<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:11.220> flip<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.700> without<00:01:12.270> ruining

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
around okay to flip that without ruining

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.060 
around okay to flip that without ruining
anything<00:01:13.290> else<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
anything else you go like this you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.440 
anything else you go like this you
pulled<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.189> side<00:01:17.400> down<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> pull

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
pulled this side down so you pull

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.880 
pulled this side down so you pull
because<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:19.530> two<00:01:19.680> corners

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
because you have these two corners

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
because you have these two corners
facing<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> pull<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:21.900> face

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
facing you so you pull the right face

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
facing you so you pull the right face
down<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.119> then<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.330> turn<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.080> away<00:01:25.259> okay<00:01:26.750> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
down and then you turn this away okay so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
down and then you turn this away okay so
basically<00:01:27.960> you're<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.380> moving<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
basically you're just moving it out of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.690 
basically you're just moving it out of
the<00:01:29.310> path<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.030> return<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.470> okay

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the path so you can return it okay

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.039 
the path so you can return it okay
so<00:01:32.700> again<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> again<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so again to do that again you have the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.340 
so again to do that again you have the
corners<00:01:34.380> facing<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> turn<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
corners facing you you turn it down the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.569 
corners facing you you turn it down the
right<00:01:37.590> face<00:01:37.770> down<00:01:38.900> over<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.460> now

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
right face down over one and up so now

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.090 
right face down over one and up so now
this<00:01:41.729> piece<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:41.939> over<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.530> then<00:01:43.530> you'll<00:01:43.950> want

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
this piece is over here then you'll want

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.560 
this piece is over here then you'll want
to<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.430> again<00:01:44.729> I'll<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.329> side

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to do that again I'll do with this side

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
to do that again I'll do with this side
so<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> turn<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> away<00:01:48.590> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
so you do this and you turn it away so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
so you do this and you turn it away so
they<00:01:49.710> could<00:01:49.770> weigh<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.759> you're

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
they could weigh from you if you're

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.550 
they could weigh from you if you're
facing<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.229> these<00:01:52.320> corners

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
facing like this so all these corners

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
facing like this so all these corners
are<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> swivel<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.399> way<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.990> up

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
are just going to swivel this way and up

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.660 
are just going to swivel this way and up
so<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.799> corner<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> want<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.520> gonna

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so now that corner you want it is gonna

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
so now that corner you want it is gonna
be<00:01:56.790> over<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> pull<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> side

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
be over here so then you pull this side

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.620 
be over here so then you pull this side
down<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.420> into<00:02:00.540> fits<00:02:00.750> mode<00:02:01.219> okay<00:02:02.630> so

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
down you just go into fits mode okay so

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.959 
down you just go into fits mode okay so
you<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:03.960> money<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> fix<00:02:04.680> mode<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.790> was

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you just money to fix mode which was

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.080 
you just money to fix mode which was
from<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.340> like

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
from here I don't like this and like

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
from here I don't like this and like
this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.080 
this
once<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.280> stuff<00:02:11.460> you<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
once you do this stuff you have to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.450 
once you do this stuff you have to
rotate<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.600> two<00:02:12.870> times<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.950> bottom<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
rotate this two times the bottom you

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.050 
rotate this two times the bottom you
have<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.760> rotate<00:02:15.120> two<00:02:15.420> times<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:17.160> realigns

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
have to rotate two times this realigns

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.630 
have to rotate two times this realigns
everything<00:02:18.770> although<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.980> shifted<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
everything although this shifted and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120 
everything although this shifted and
turned<00:02:20.910> around<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.720> fine<00:02:22.020> as<00:02:22.320> long<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.950> it's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
turned around it's fine as long as it's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.510 
turned around it's fine as long as it's
in<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> right<00:02:23.550> place<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.090> blue<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.960> blue<00:02:25.800> red

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
in the right place so blue and blue red

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.300 
in the right place so blue and blue red
and<00:02:26.670> red<00:02:26.910> which<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.750> good<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.830> now<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.160> see

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and red which is good so now you can see

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.340 
and red which is good so now you can see
that<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> blue<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:31.110> them<00:02:31.200> two

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that we have a blue here with them two

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.610 
that we have a blue here with them two
and<00:02:31.560> orange<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.160> orange<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.880> we're<00:02:33.030> good<00:02:33.620> so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and orange and orange so we're good so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.710 
and orange and orange so we're good so
now<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:34.890> need<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> switch<00:02:35.280> these<00:02:35.490> two

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
now we just need to switch these two

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.890 
now we just need to switch these two
okay

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
okay

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.260 
okay
it<00:02:37.860> doesn't<00:02:38.250> matter<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.760> if<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.090> need<00:02:39.210> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
it doesn't matter like if you need to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.670 
it doesn't matter like if you need to
switch<00:02:39.330> these<00:02:39.600> do<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.930> video<00:02:40.200> these<00:02:40.350> do<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
switch these do this video these do that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.410 
switch these do this video these do that
way<00:02:40.800> you're<00:02:41.580> always<00:02:41.760> gonna<00:02:41.940> pull<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
way you're always gonna pull on the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.100 
way you're always gonna pull on the
right<00:02:42.600> face<00:02:44.030> okay<00:02:45.030> move<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.660> bottom<00:02:45.960> piece

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
right face okay move the bottom piece

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.700 
right face okay move the bottom piece
out<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.410> way

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
out of the way

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.480 
out of the way
and<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:48.080> then<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.200> move<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.380> front<00:02:49.590> face<00:02:49.830> like

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
and up then you move the front face like

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.150 
and up then you move the front face like
this<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.720> bottom<00:02:51.900> piece<00:02:52.200> away<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:53.010> you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
this do the bottom piece away from you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160 
this do the bottom piece away from you
that<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.700> key<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.240> do<00:02:54.450> not<00:02:54.630> want<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.959> turn<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
that is key you do not want to turn it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.660 
that is key you do not want to turn it
like<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.650> want<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.890> turn<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> away<00:02:56.310> from

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
like this you want to turn it away from

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.960 
like this you want to turn it away from
you<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.330> up<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.640> then<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.880> of

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
you and up and then see it then one of

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.900 
you and up and then see it then one of
the<00:03:00.060> corner<00:03:00.300> pieces<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.910> then

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the corner pieces are up here and then

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.050 
the corner pieces are up here and then
you<00:03:03.120> want<00:03:03.240> it<00:03:03.390> down<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.990> over<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.070> fix<00:03:05.459> twist

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
you want it down and over to fix twist

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.080 
you want it down and over to fix twist
two<00:03:06.209> times<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:12.030> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
two times so now we see that this is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.990 
two times so now we see that this is
okay<00:03:12.510> these<00:03:13.290> two<00:03:13.500> or<00:03:13.650> these<00:03:13.680> two<00:03:14.550> colors<00:03:14.790> match

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
okay these two or these two colors match

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.020 
okay these two or these two colors match
up<00:03:15.120> with<00:03:15.209> these<00:03:15.330> two<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.470> okay<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.030> these

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
up with these two this is okay and these

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.600 
up with these two this is okay and these
two<00:03:18.239> are<00:03:18.269> okay<00:03:18.630> because<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:20.070> green<00:03:20.340> goes

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
two are okay because this green goes

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.350 
two are okay because this green goes
over<00:03:20.790> here<00:03:20.970> orange<00:03:21.390> goes<00:03:21.810> over<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:23.360> this

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
over here orange goes over here and this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.630 
over here orange goes over here and this
red<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:25.080> over<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.860> green<00:03:26.100> goes<00:03:26.459> over

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
red was over here and green goes over

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.380 
red was over here and green goes over
here<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:28.110> we're<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.130> good<00:03:29.220> spot<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.790> now

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
here so we're in a good spot so now

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.120 
here so we're in a good spot so now
since<00:03:30.630> we<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.780> everything<00:03:31.230> aligned<00:03:31.680> we

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
since we have everything aligned we

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.390 
since we have everything aligned we
could<00:03:32.280> jump<00:03:32.550> toward<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.880> next<00:03:33.090> step<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.280> this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
could jump toward the next step so this

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.250 
could jump toward the next step so this
next<00:03:35.610> step<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.090> three<00:03:36.540> point<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:37.080> or

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
next step is like a three point one or

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.110 
next step is like a three point one or
three<00:03:37.590> point<00:03:37.860> five<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> sub<00:03:38.880> step

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
three point five it's like a sub step

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.610 
three point five it's like a sub step
you<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.660> need<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.840> rotate<00:03:39.989> all<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.260> corners

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
you just need to rotate all the corners

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.560 
you just need to rotate all the corners
because<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:41.970> these<00:03:42.330> don't

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
because it is you can see these don't

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.370 
because it is you can see these don't
match<00:03:42.660> up<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:44.570> after<00:03:45.570> doing<00:03:45.930> all<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.200> those

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
match up so after doing all of those

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.800 
match up so after doing all of those
corner<00:03:46.890> swapping<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:48.090> find<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.600> these

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
corner swapping and you find that these

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.660 
corner swapping and you find that these
two<00:03:48.870> they're<00:03:49.410> all<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.769> right<00:03:49.890> place<00:03:50.130> but

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
two they're all in the right place but

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.570 
two they're all in the right place but
they<00:03:50.820> just<00:03:51.000> need<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.209> be<00:03:51.239> rotated<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.550> a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
they just need to be rotated this is a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.550 
they just need to be rotated this is a
really<00:03:53.880> easy<00:03:53.910> pattern<00:03:54.420> pull<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> right<00:03:55.380> face

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
really easy pattern pull the right face

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.500 
really easy pattern pull the right face
down<00:03:55.800> on<00:03:56.040> Oh

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
down on Oh

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.000 
down on Oh
first<00:03:57.989> make<00:03:58.290> sure<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.590> none<00:03:58.800> of<00:03:58.830> these

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
first make sure that none of these

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.190 
first make sure that none of these
natural<00:03:59.459> if<00:03:59.640> one<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.480> them<00:04:00.600> matches<00:04:00.780> up<00:04:01.019> like

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
natural if one of them matches up like

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.100 
natural if one of them matches up like
this<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:01.920> good<00:04:02.220> if<00:04:02.850> two<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> them<00:04:03.570> matches<00:04:03.840> up

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
this it's good if two of them matches up

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.110 
this it's good if two of them matches up
like<00:04:04.290> more<00:04:04.530> than<00:04:04.650> one<00:04:04.769> matches<00:04:05.100> up<00:04:05.220> choose<00:04:05.820> one

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
like more than one matches up choose one

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360 
like more than one matches up choose one
that<00:04:06.239> hasn't<00:04:06.540> been<00:04:06.750> matched<00:04:07.080> up<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.440> do<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
that hasn't been matched up and do the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.890 
that hasn't been matched up and do the
move<00:04:08.549> because<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.239> don't<00:04:09.390> want<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.720> only

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
move because you don't want you only

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.840 
move because you don't want you only
want<00:04:10.140> one<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.620> be<00:04:10.739> matched<00:04:10.950> up<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.370> order<00:04:11.700> for

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
want one to be matched up in order for

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.440 
want one to be matched up in order for
this<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:11.970> work<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:14.340> move<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:15.120> go<00:04:15.299> like

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
this to work so this move you go like

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.479 
this to work so this move you go like
this<00:04:15.480> I'm<00:04:15.959> gonna<00:04:16.229> do<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> dud<00:04:16.890> side<00:04:17.160> so

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
this I'm gonna do it on a dud side so

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.190 
this I'm gonna do it on a dud side so
I've<00:04:17.609> had<00:04:17.790> more<00:04:17.940> chances<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.780> show<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.020> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
I've had more chances to show you the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.770 
I've had more chances to show you the
different<00:04:19.500> possibilities

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
different possibilities

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.690 
different possibilities
so<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.620> rotate<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:23.010> corners<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.340> pull<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
so to rotate the corners you pull the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.550 
so to rotate the corners you pull the
right<00:04:23.850> face<00:04:24.030> down<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:25.170> pull<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.470> away

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
right face down and you pull it away

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.560 
right face down and you pull it away
like<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.639> like<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.910> first<00:04:27.180> step<00:04:27.270> in

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
like this this is like the first step in

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.840 
like this this is like the first step in
swapping<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.110> corners<00:04:28.470> although<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.610> time

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
swapping the corners although this time

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.970 
swapping the corners although this time
instead<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.240> pulling<00:04:30.480> this<00:04:30.690> side<00:04:30.870> over<00:04:31.020> you

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
instead of pulling this side over you

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.280 
instead of pulling this side over you
just<00:04:32.010> move<00:04:32.280> this<00:04:32.370> over<00:04:32.520> one<00:04:32.820> more<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.990> now<00:04:34.169> it's

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
just move this over one more so now it's

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.590 
just move this over one more so now it's
on<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.470> opposite<00:04:34.800> face<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.210> pull<00:04:36.480> this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
on the opposite face then you pull this

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.320 
on the opposite face then you pull this
down<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.770> pull<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:38.070> back<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.490> this

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
down and you just pull it back in this

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.550 
down and you just pull it back in this
is<00:04:39.450> really<00:04:39.600> simple<00:04:39.900> you're<00:04:40.169> just<00:04:40.200> doing<00:04:40.530> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
is really simple you're just doing a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.210 
is really simple you're just doing a
couple<00:04:40.800> turns<00:04:40.919> no<00:04:41.910> thinking<00:04:42.330> or<00:04:42.510> anything<00:04:43.220> so

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
couple turns no thinking or anything so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.710 
couple turns no thinking or anything so
now<00:04:44.340> as<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.580> can<00:04:44.669> see<00:04:44.880> they're<00:04:45.060> all<00:04:45.240> scrambled

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
now as you can see they're all scrambled

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.090 
now as you can see they're all scrambled
up<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.050> none<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.350> them<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.770> right<00:04:46.860> place

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
up so none of them in the right place

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.879 
up so none of them in the right place
then<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.639> choose<00:04:47.850> one<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:49.290> then<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.650> pull

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
then you choose one and then you pull

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.540 
then you choose one and then you pull
down<00:04:50.100> like<00:04:50.790> this<00:04:51.440> okay<00:04:52.440> then<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:53.190> turn<00:04:53.460> it

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
down like this okay then you turn it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.909 
down like this okay then you turn it
away<00:04:54.169> down<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.680> like<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:58.470> twist<00:04:58.620> two

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
away down and like this and twist two

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.720 
away down and like this and twist two
times<00:05:00.950> then<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.100> look<00:05:02.250> around<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.520> cube

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
times then you look around the cube

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.670 
times then you look around the cube
there's<00:05:02.970> any<00:05:03.090> one<00:05:03.210> match<00:05:03.419> up<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:04.440> one

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
there's any one match up this one

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.670 
there's any one match up this one
matches<00:05:04.890> up<00:05:05.160> okay<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:07.110> keep<00:05:07.290> doing<00:05:07.350> that

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
matches up okay so you keep doing that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.320 
matches up okay so you keep doing that
with<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.890> duck<00:05:08.160> until<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.580> have<00:05:08.700> only<00:05:08.730> one

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
with a duck until you have only one

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.360 
with a duck until you have only one
matched<00:05:09.690> up<00:05:09.930> when<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.530> have<00:05:10.680> only<00:05:11.040> one

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
matched up when you have only one

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.080 
matched up when you have only one
matched<00:05:11.760> up<00:05:12.030> put<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:12.630> one<00:05:12.990> on<00:05:13.169> your<00:05:13.740> left<00:05:14.090> so

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
matched up put that one on your left so

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.150 
matched up put that one on your left so
if<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:15.240> like<00:05:15.330> this<00:05:15.540> turn<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.229> cube<00:05:16.500> so

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
if it's like this turn it the cube so

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.159 
if it's like this turn it the cube so
then<00:05:17.310> it's<00:05:17.460> on<00:05:17.550> your<00:05:17.669> left<00:05:17.790> side<00:05:17.930> that's<00:05:18.930> gonna

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
then it's on your left side that's gonna

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.440 
then it's on your left side that's gonna
be<00:05:19.350> your<00:05:19.470> base<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:20.370> is<00:05:20.490> gonna<00:05:20.580> stay<00:05:20.880> but<00:05:21.270> all

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
be your base this is gonna stay but all

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.320 
be your base this is gonna stay but all
of<00:05:21.600> these<00:05:21.660> are<00:05:21.840> going<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.020> start<00:05:22.229> switching<00:05:23.330> so

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
of these are going to start switching so

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.110 
of these are going to start switching so
you<00:05:24.930> do<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.200> same<00:05:25.380> move<00:05:25.610> usually<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.669> goes<00:05:26.820> one

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
you do the same move usually it goes one

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.940 
you do the same move usually it goes one
or<00:05:27.240> two<00:05:27.360> times<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:27.990> basically<00:05:28.290> you<00:05:28.530> twist<00:05:28.830> this

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
or two times so basically you twist this

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.520 
or two times so basically you twist this
two<00:05:29.130> times<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:31.290> pull<00:05:31.590> up<00:05:31.740> twist<00:05:32.700> do<00:05:33.530> usually

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
two times and pull up twist do usually

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.440 
two times and pull up twist do usually
when<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:34.890> find<00:05:34.919> one<00:05:35.340> piece<00:05:35.610> that's<00:05:35.940> good<00:05:36.240> and

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
when you find one piece that's good and

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.900 
when you find one piece that's good and
easy<00:05:37.080> takes<00:05:37.320> one<00:05:37.590> or<00:05:37.800> two<00:05:38.010> like<00:05:38.370> terms<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.789> this

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
easy takes one or two like terms of this

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.810 
easy takes one or two like terms of this
move<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.360> order<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.750> solve<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.310> now<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.370> always

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
move in order to solve it now you always

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.210 
move in order to solve it now you always
have<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.030> remember<00:05:42.150> only<00:05:43.080> have<00:05:43.350> that<00:05:43.590> one<00:05:43.650> side

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
have to remember only have that one side

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.219 
have to remember only have that one side
done<00:05:44.550> if<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.180> have<00:05:45.330> more<00:05:45.570> than<00:05:45.690> one<00:05:45.900> it's

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
done if you have more than one it's

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.320 
done if you have more than one it's
gonna<00:05:46.380> just<00:05:46.950> totally<00:05:47.400> ruin<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:47.789> cube<00:05:48.030> like

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
gonna just totally ruin the cube like

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.700 
gonna just totally ruin the cube like
ruin<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:48.810> corners<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.350> you're<00:05:49.470> gonna<00:05:49.560> have

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
ruin the corners and you're gonna have

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.740 
ruin the corners and you're gonna have
more<00:05:49.770> work<00:05:50.220> so<00:05:51.000> just<00:05:51.180> keep<00:05:51.330> with<00:05:51.450> it<00:05:51.539> other

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
more work so just keep with it other

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.350 
more work so just keep with it other
than<00:05:51.900> keep<00:05:52.080> doing<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:52.440> so<00:05:52.590> now<00:05:53.430> we<00:05:54.000> had<00:05:54.180> these

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
than keep doing it so now we had these

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.180 
than keep doing it so now we had these
down<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.890> we're<00:05:55.890> off<00:05:56.039> to<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.520> final<00:05:56.970> step
