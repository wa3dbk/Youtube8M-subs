Jerome Le Banner

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:13.299
Q:Tell us about the fight.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:21.687
I'm in a different training environment and I trained differently as well.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:27.755
I was able to start this year with a win.

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:46.656
Q:Your impression of Spong?

00:00:46.843 --> 00:00:54.614
He has speed and technique and is a good fighter.

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:19.283
Q:He broke his right fist soon after the beginning of the fight. Did you realize it?

00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:25.333
Really? I had no idea.

00:01:27.957 --> 00:01:47.728
Q:Changing your environment had what kind of effect on you?

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:54.843
There were many positive aspects.

00:01:54.843 --> 00:02:06.590
The people I trained with became like my family and I was able to become a new person.

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:28.803
Q:What will this year be like for you?

00:02:28.803 --> 00:02:38.883
I was able to win, so first I'll buy a new car (laughter). And then I'll begin training again.

00:02:43.814 --> 00:03:04.347
Q:A few years ago we'd never be able to imagine you here next to Tom Harink. 

00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:17.144
Thom Harinck: It may look strange to you, but we trained together 15 years ago.

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:28.868
I was his opponent, but we kept in touch and since he wanted to train seriously with me he was very welcome.

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:42.820
Over the next three years we will aim for the top and you will see him become champion.

00:03:44.509 --> 00:04:12.982
The past is the past. Now we are working together. We used to be like enemies in the ring, but now we will walk the same path together.
