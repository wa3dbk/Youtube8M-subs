00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
fact I found this one a little bit more

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
fact I found this one a little bit more
of<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.219> challenge<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:11.940> well<00:00:12.210> as<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.480> little<00:00:12.599> bit

of a challenge as well as a little bit
more<00:00:12.960> fun<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:14.480> you<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.509> make<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> rendering<00:00:16.590> up

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
more fun to you know make a rendering up

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.450 
more fun to you know make a rendering up
and<00:00:17.900> I'll<00:00:18.900> show<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.859> quite<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
and I'll show you because I have quite a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.670 
and I'll show you because I have quite a
few<00:00:20.660> versions<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.619> ahead

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
few versions of this and if you go ahead

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.670 
few versions of this and if you go ahead
and<00:00:25.800> take<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> look<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.680> Wyoming

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and take a look here this is Wyoming

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.759 
and take a look here this is Wyoming
University's<00:00:29.519> War<00:00:29.970> Memorial<00:00:30.179> Stadium<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.679> if

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
University's War Memorial Stadium now if

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.200 
University's War Memorial Stadium now if
you'll<00:00:31.920> notice<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.369> haven't<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.910> done<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you'll notice I haven't really done a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.410 
you'll notice I haven't really done a
lot<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.570> detail<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> back<00:00:36.030> area

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
lot of detail into this in the back area

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880 
lot of detail into this in the back area
here<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.840> there's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> reason<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
here and there's a reason for that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.209 
here and there's a reason for that
because<00:00:38.930> drawing<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> lattice

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
because drawing in all that the lattice

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.990 
because drawing in all that the lattice
and<00:00:42.110> lattices<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.170> stuff<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.920> just

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
and lattices and stuff like that just

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.630 
and lattices and stuff like that just
would<00:00:45.000> eat<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.420> far<00:00:45.780> too<00:00:45.809> much<00:00:46.079> time<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.770> cared

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
would eat up far too much time I cared

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
would eat up far too much time I cared
more<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.149> look<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> inside<00:00:49.170> than

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
more about the look on the inside than

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.270 
more about the look on the inside than
the<00:00:49.410> outside<00:00:49.530> obviously<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> point<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the outside obviously at this point and

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
the outside obviously at this point and
I'm<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:53.550> sure<00:00:53.640> EA<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.780> gonna

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
I'm pretty sure EA is not really gonna

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.830 
I'm pretty sure EA is not really gonna
care<00:00:55.289> about<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.710> outside<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
care about the outside the look of it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.860 
care about the outside the look of it
until<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:58.379> feel<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
until they feel they need to but as you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
until they feel they need to but as you
can<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.579> close

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
can see here is a pretty close

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.340 
can see here is a pretty close
representation<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.080> looks<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.729> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
representation of what it looks like a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
representation of what it looks like a
lot<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> people<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.890> tell<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.450> our<00:01:09.810> big

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
lot of people will tell you that our big

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
lot of people will tell you that our big
supporters<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> Wyoming<00:01:11.729> University<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
supporters of Wyoming University that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.999

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
here on the east side line side not the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.260 
here on the east side line side not the
west<00:01:21.420> side<00:01:21.750> line<00:01:22.020> sight<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
west side line sight which is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.679 
west side line sight which is
represented<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:25.460> NC<00:01:26.460> double-a<00:01:26.790> football<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
represented in NC double-a football so

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
represented in NC double-a football so
EA<00:01:27.900> Sports<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.979> wrong<00:01:29.450> quite<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> few

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
EA Sports got that one wrong quite a few

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
EA Sports got that one wrong quite a few
things<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.320> wrong<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
things they got wrong in a lot of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420 
things they got wrong in a lot of
different<00:01:32.820> areas<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.710> case<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.159> got

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
different areas but in this case I got

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.630 
different areas but in this case I got
it<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> put<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.500> west<00:01:38.040> side<00:01:38.430> line

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it right I put it on the west side line

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.280 
it right I put it on the west side line
side<00:01:39.290> Brown<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> main<00:01:40.860> color<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.460> Wyoming

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
side Brown is the main color for Wyoming

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
side Brown is the main color for Wyoming
University<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.530> that's<00:01:43.740> why<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.520> looks

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
University so that's why it all looks

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.530 
University so that's why it all looks
Brown<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> first

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
Brown and here we have the first

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.950 
Brown and here we have the first
expansion<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.579> North<00:01:51.240> endzone<00:01:52.110> side<00:01:53.960> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
expansion to the North endzone side this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.219 
expansion to the North endzone side this
is<00:01:55.020> probably<00:01:55.619> an<00:01:55.829> additional<00:01:56.899> 10,000<00:01:57.899> seats

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
is probably an additional 10,000 seats

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.179 
is probably an additional 10,000 seats
bringing<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.689> 40,000<00:02:00.689> also<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.950> on

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
bringing it to about 40,000 also here on

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.880 
bringing it to about 40,000 also here on
the<00:02:02.850> sideline<00:02:03.450> sites<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.990> also<00:02:04.259> increase<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the sideline sites we also increase the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039 
the sideline sites we also increase the
seating<00:02:05.070> capacity<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.659> bit<00:02:06.810> more

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
seating capacity a little bit more

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.210 
seating capacity a little bit more
probably<00:02:07.500> adding<00:02:07.979> another<00:02:08.190> 1,500<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.220> right

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
probably adding another 1,500 so right

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.160 
probably adding another 1,500 so right
now<00:02:11.340> we're<00:02:11.459> probably<00:02:11.580> looking<00:02:11.970> at

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
now we're probably looking at

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.190 
now we're probably looking at
and<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.590> brought<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.040> from<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.610> over<00:02:14.840> 30

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and that brought it from just over 30

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.589 
and that brought it from just over 30
I<00:02:16.230> think<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.569> 35,000<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:19.349> just<00:02:20.599> just

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
I think it's 35,000 to now just just

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.339 
I think it's 35,000 to now just just
under<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.650> would<00:02:23.459> say<00:02:23.930> 42,000<00:02:24.930> seats<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:27.349> the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
under I would say 42,000 seats in the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.780 
under I would say 42,000 seats in the
second<00:02:28.770> expansion<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.819> here<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
second expansion you can see here on the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.699 
second expansion you can see here on the
west<00:02:32.790> end<00:02:33.030> zone<00:02:33.420> there's<00:02:33.690> West<00:02:34.080> sideline<00:02:34.470> sign

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709

panning around here you can see some

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.130 
panning around here you can see some
detail<00:03:04.890> was<00:03:05.130> added<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.060> not<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.299> lot<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.780> some

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
detail was added and not a lot but some

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.240 
detail was added and not a lot but some
detail<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.650> added<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:10.010> luxury<00:03:11.010> box

seating<00:03:11.580> area<00:03:12.060> side<00:03:12.780> as<00:03:13.019> well<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:17.519> bigger

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
seating area side as well but the bigger

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.819 
seating area side as well but the bigger
the<00:03:19.260> bigger<00:03:19.380> thing<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.840> new<00:03:22.590> main

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the bigger thing is here the new main

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.699 
the bigger thing is here the new main
entrance<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.239> stadium<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.049> right<00:03:25.380> here

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
entrance to the stadium is right here

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.979 
entrance to the stadium is right here
the<00:03:25.920> parking<00:03:26.280> lot<00:03:26.430> expands<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.299> from<00:03:27.780> there

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
the parking lot expands out from there

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.800 
the parking lot expands out from there
so<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.650> would<00:03:28.859> make<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> perfect<00:03:29.810> opportunity

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
so this would make a perfect opportunity

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.490 
so this would make a perfect opportunity
to<00:03:30.840> look<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> new<00:03:32.609> main<00:03:33.540> entrance<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.260> kind

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
to look see a new main entrance I kind

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.530 
to look see a new main entrance I kind
of<00:03:34.560> fooled<00:03:34.769> around<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.400> few<00:03:35.730> ideas<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.329> like

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
of fooled around with a few ideas I like

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.180 
of fooled around with a few ideas I like
this<00:03:36.930> one<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:39.540> kind<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.109> gives<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.530> unique

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
this one it just kind of gives a unique

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.390 
this one it just kind of gives a unique
feel<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.560> really<00:03:43.799> starts<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
feel and you know it's really starts to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.500 
feel and you know it's really starts to
grab<00:03:44.700> your<00:03:44.940> attention<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:48.239> we've

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
grab your attention and now we've

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.920 
grab your attention and now we've
expanded<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.530> think<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.209> remember<00:03:51.269> correctly

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
expanded I think if I remember correctly

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.800 
expanded I think if I remember correctly
the<00:03:52.290> seating<00:03:52.709> capacity<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.090> calculated

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
the seating capacity that I calculated

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.990 
the seating capacity that I calculated
was<00:03:54.900> close<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.859> about<00:03:56.750> 70,000<00:03:57.750> people<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:59.280> in

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
was close to about 70,000 people and in

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.569 
was close to about 70,000 people and in
the<00:04:00.150> final<00:04:00.470> expansion<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.680> version<00:04:02.430> 1<00:04:02.790> of

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the final expansion on version 1 of

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.890 
the final expansion on version 1 of
Wyoming<00:04:05.579> University's<00:04:06.359> War<00:04:06.690> Memorial

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
Wyoming University's War Memorial

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.199 
Wyoming University's War Memorial
Stadium<00:04:07.590> as<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.130> see<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.489> Alvin<00:04:08.940> zone

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
Stadium as you can see this Alvin zone

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.300 
Stadium as you can see this Alvin zone
was<00:04:09.420> finally<00:04:09.840> closed<00:04:10.139> out<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> second<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
was finally closed out with a second and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.900 
was finally closed out with a second and
third-tier<00:04:12.859> pan<00:04:13.859> in<00:04:14.040> here<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.430> bit<00:04:14.579> show

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
third-tier pan in here a little bit show

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.229 
third-tier pan in here a little bit show
you<00:04:14.970> guys<00:04:15.209> what<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.660> would<00:04:15.810> look<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.049> now

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
you guys what it would look like now

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.509 
you guys what it would look like now
again<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.389> is<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:18.810> version<00:04:19.380> 1<00:04:19.709> this

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
again this is just version 1 this

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.990 
again this is just version 1 this
probably<00:04:21.000> gets<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.450> close<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.470> about<00:04:23.450> 90,000

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
probably gets you close to about 90,000

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.090 
probably gets you close to about 90,000
but<00:04:25.120> not<00:04:25.630> exact<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.350> would<00:04:26.530> say<00:04:26.650> it's<00:04:26.800> probably

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
but not exact I would say it's probably

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.820 
but not exact I would say it's probably
closer<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.600> 85,000<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.690> for<00:04:28.810> my<00:04:29.080> calculations

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
closer to 85,000 and for my calculations

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.000 
closer to 85,000 and for my calculations
were<00:04:30.040> correct<00:04:30.630> but<00:04:31.630> either<00:04:32.020> way<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.920> know

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
were correct but either way you know

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.070 
were correct but either way you know
inside<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.640> can<00:04:33.790> definitely<00:04:33.940> see<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.720> lot<00:04:35.050> of

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
inside you can definitely see a lot of

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.530 
inside you can definitely see a lot of
expansion<00:04:35.560> has<00:04:35.920> occurred<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:36.940> know<00:04:36.970> we<00:04:37.420> don't

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
expansion has occurred you know we don't

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.410 
expansion has occurred you know we don't
have<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:38.920> see<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.250> outside<00:04:39.400> SEP<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.240> few

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
have to see the outside SEP for a few

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.560 
have to see the outside SEP for a few
pieces<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:41.080> guess<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:42.210> tried<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.330> give<00:04:43.450> the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
pieces I guess I tried to give the

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.270 
pieces I guess I tried to give the
outside<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:43.990> little<00:04:44.230> bit<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.590> detail<00:04:44.950> as<00:04:45.100> much

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280
