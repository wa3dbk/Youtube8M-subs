00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
okay this is going to be one of the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.580 
okay this is going to be one of the
easiest<00:00:17.130> flies<00:00:17.490> you'll<00:00:17.820> ever<00:00:18.000> tie<00:00:18.869> although

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
easiest flies you'll ever tie although

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.029 
easiest flies you'll ever tie although
we're<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.770> tying<00:00:20.279> much<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:21.769> but<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
we're not tying much here but it is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
we're not tying much here but it is
effective<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.730> we're<00:00:24.510> gonna<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.779> ahead<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
effective so we're gonna go ahead and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.700 
effective so we're gonna go ahead and
start<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> thread<00:00:25.800> base<00:00:26.599> work<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.960> our

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
start with the thread base work way our

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.209 
start with the thread base work way our
way<00:00:28.920> back<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.769> midpoint<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
way back to about the midpoint of the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.290 
way back to about the midpoint of the
shank<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:34.399> just<00:00:35.399> build<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> little<00:00:35.969> thread

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
shank and just build up a little thread

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
shank and just build up a little thread
base

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:01:00.090 

and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:44.790> we<00:00:44.880> would<00:00:45.030> finish

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.410 

and<00:01:01.100> now<00:01:01.220> we<00:01:01.280> take<00:01:01.520> our<00:01:01.730> egg<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.150> is<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
and now we take our egg and this is the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.479 
and now we take our egg and this is the
utter<00:01:02.630> soft<00:01:03.140> egg<00:01:03.350> material<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.129> montana

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
utter soft egg material for a montana

utter soft egg material for a montana
fly<00:01:04.730> company<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.730> these<00:01:08.140> i've<00:01:09.140> tried<00:01:09.590> these

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
fly company and these i've tried these

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.480 
fly company and these i've tried these
next<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:12.080> yarn<00:01:12.380> eggs<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.190> there's<00:01:13.310> no

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
next to the yarn eggs and there's no

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.160 
next to the yarn eggs and there's no
comparison<00:01:14.090> these<00:01:14.210> will<00:01:14.420> out<00:01:14.570> fishing<00:01:14.990> our

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
comparison these will out fishing our

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.300 
comparison these will out fishing our
neg<00:01:15.350> any<00:01:15.620> day<00:01:15.860> obviously<00:01:16.600> they're<00:01:17.600> squishy

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
neg any day obviously they're squishy

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.290 
neg any day obviously they're squishy
more<00:01:19.310> realistic<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:25.100> what<00:01:25.820> we're<00:01:25.940> gonna<00:01:26.000> do

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
more realistic so what we're gonna do

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.180 
more realistic so what we're gonna do
here<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:27.710> take<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.850> fly<00:01:29.780> out<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.530> hook<00:01:31.040> out

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
here is take the fly out of the hook out

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.840 
here is take the fly out of the hook out
of<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.430> vise<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.380> what<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.410> like<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.860> do<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:34.250> like

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
of the vise and what I like to do I like

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.359 
of the vise and what I like to do I like
to<00:01:34.910> grab<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.619> hook<00:01:39.550> with<00:01:40.550> some<00:01:40.729> tweezers<00:01:41.000> like

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
to grab the hook with some tweezers like

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.590 
to grab the hook with some tweezers like
so<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.380> then<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.800> wanna<00:01:46.130> dab<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> little<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:47.240> of

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
so and then I wanna dab a little bit of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.859 
so and then I wanna dab a little bit of
superglue<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.890> shank<00:01:49.220> where<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:50.509> thread

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
superglue on the shank where the thread

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.550 
superglue on the shank where the thread
is<00:01:52.300> that's<00:01:53.300> going<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.570> help<00:01:53.750> secure<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:55.270> egg

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
is that's going to help secure that egg

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.499 
is that's going to help secure that egg
onto<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> hook<00:01:57.950> because<00:01:58.880> these<00:01:59.119> things<00:01:59.330> are

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
onto the hook because these things are

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.920 
onto the hook because these things are
very<00:01:59.890> delicate<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.310> they<00:02:01.550> will<00:02:01.789> slide<00:02:02.479> off<00:02:02.690> so

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
very delicate and they will slide off so

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.300 
very delicate and they will slide off so
this<00:02:03.050> gives<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.350> little<00:02:03.500> bit<00:02:03.649> reinforcement

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
this gives a little bit reinforcement

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.250 
this gives a little bit reinforcement
that's<00:02:04.790> another<00:02:05.030> reason<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.510> tie<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.810> thread

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
that's another reason I tie the thread

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:19.320 
that's another reason I tie the thread
on<00:02:06.500> there<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.030> simply<00:02:08.420> impale<00:02:09.260> that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.580 

and<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.840> kind<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.140> work<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.560> around<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.470> now

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
and I kind of work that around and now

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.400 
and I kind of work that around and now
that<00:02:23.800> thread<00:02:24.460> in<00:02:24.640> there<00:02:24.790> gives<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.630> little

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
that thread in there gives that a little

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.180 
that thread in there gives that a little
more<00:02:27.250> lifelike<00:02:27.850> look<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.830> embryo<00:02:29.830> inside

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
more lifelike look of a embryo inside

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.680 
more lifelike look of a embryo inside
that<00:02:30.340> egg<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:32.050> there's<00:02:32.920> our<00:02:33.220> egg<00:02:33.690> pretty

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
that egg and so there's our egg pretty

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:45.790 
that egg and so there's our egg pretty
easy

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.860 

you
