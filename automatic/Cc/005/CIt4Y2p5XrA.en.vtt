now<00:00:01.439> if<00:00:01.589> you're<00:00:01.770> put<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.220> second<00:00:02.639> arch<00:00:02.820> onto

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
now if you're put in a second arch onto

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.760 
now if you're put in a second arch onto
this<00:00:03.589> it's<00:00:04.640> easier<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.140> upside<00:00:07.710> down

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
this it's easier to have it upside down

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.940 
this it's easier to have it upside down
on<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> flat<00:00:08.610> surface<00:00:12.139> we<00:00:13.139> actually<00:00:13.530> run<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
on the flat surface we actually run a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.750 
on the flat surface we actually run a
fill<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.460> glue<00:00:14.700> down<00:00:15.109> the<00:00:16.109> insides<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
fill it of glue down the insides just to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.859 
fill it of glue down the insides just to
tack<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.000> into<00:00:18.270> position<00:00:25.400> that's<00:00:26.400> shown<00:00:26.869> now

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
tack it into position that's shown now

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.710 
tack it into position that's shown now
just<00:00:28.830> hold<00:00:29.039> these<00:00:29.310> together<00:00:29.689> ensuring<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
just hold these together ensuring that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.870 
just hold these together ensuring that
they're<00:00:31.080> absolutely<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> correct<00:00:32.579> plane

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
they're absolutely in the correct plane

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.190 
they're absolutely in the correct plane
to<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.270> another<00:00:38.120> now<00:00:39.120> once<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.480> tack<00:00:39.989> has

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to one another now once that tack has

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.340 
to one another now once that tack has
gone<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.480> turn<00:00:42.870> upside<00:00:43.110> down

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
gone off and you can turn upside down

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.799 
gone off and you can turn upside down
and<00:00:44.930> then<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.200> carefully<00:00:50.090> run<00:00:51.090> fill<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and then very carefully run fill it of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:07.930 
and then very carefully run fill it of
glue<00:00:52.670> over<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.879> joint<00:00:55.699> at<00:00:56.699> each<00:00:56.969> side

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.240 

this<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.410> allow<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.160> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this you will then have to allow for the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.970 
this you will then have to allow for the
cement<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> same<00:01:13.380> time<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
cement to go off at the same time a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.910 
cement to go off at the same time a
philip<00:01:14.430> run<00:01:14.730> across<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> actual<00:01:15.690> deck<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
philip run across the actual deck of the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.400 
philip run across the actual deck of the
bridge<00:01:18.110> as<00:01:19.110> such<00:01:20.420> for<00:01:21.420> helping<00:01:21.960> holding

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
bridge as such for helping holding

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.860 
bridge as such for helping holding
everything<00:01:22.770> nicely<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.490> plain<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:27.630> push

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
everything nicely in plain just push

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.090 
everything nicely in plain just push
gently<00:01:28.260> together<00:01:32.150> all<00:01:33.150> right<00:01:33.300> there<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.720> have

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
gently together all right there we have

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.420 
gently together all right there we have
basically<00:01:35.100> two<00:01:36.060> Artie's<00:01:36.450> assembled<00:01:37.050> now<00:01:37.890> what

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
basically two Artie's assembled now what

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
basically two Artie's assembled now what
we<00:01:38.580> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.350> really

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
we have to do to make this a really

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.500 
we have to do to make this a really
strong<00:01:41.250> joint<00:01:41.930> again<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.410> very<00:01:43.530> carefully

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
strong joint again very very carefully

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.780 
strong joint again very very carefully
run<00:01:45.510> a<00:01:45.780> Philip<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.320> glue<00:01:46.530> down<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.160> central

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
run a Philip that glue down the central

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.630 
run a Philip that glue down the central
joint<00:01:48.120> as<00:01:49.020> such<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:52.590> will<00:01:52.860> tend<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.280> make<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
joint as such this will tend to make the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.110 
joint as such this will tend to make the
plastic<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.270> slightly<00:01:55.170> shiny<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.790> can

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
plastic go slightly shiny but it can

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.030 
plastic go slightly shiny but it can
actually<00:01:57.330> be<00:01:57.690> taken<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.260> with<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
actually be taken out with the use of a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.070 
actually be taken out with the use of a
fibreglass<00:01:59.580> eraser<00:02:01.640> there<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.870> two

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
fibreglass eraser there we have the two

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.270 
fibreglass eraser there we have the two
Artie's<00:02:04.500> joined<00:02:04.770> together<00:02:05.390> now<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:08.070> have

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
Artie's joined together now as we have

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880 
Artie's joined together now as we have
to<00:02:08.460> put<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:08.940> piece<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.380> bottom<00:02:10.710> which

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to put in the piece in the bottom which

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.750 
to put in the piece in the bottom which
is<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.100> top<00:02:11.760> cap<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.239> stone<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.050> pier<00:02:13.760> it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
is the top cap in stone of the pier it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.540 
is the top cap in stone of the pier it
is<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> good<00:02:15.570> time<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.050> fit<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:17.370> it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
is now a good time to fit it now it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.680 
is now a good time to fit it now it
seems<00:02:18.270> as<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.770> will<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.220> too<00:02:20.520> tight<00:02:20.880> but

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
seems as if this will be too tight but

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.690 
seems as if this will be too tight but
it's<00:02:21.870> easier<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:22.980> again<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.280> think

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it's easier to do it and again you think

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's easier to do it and again you think
we<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.140> open<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.440> side<00:02:25.650> cheeks<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.400> then

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
we just open up the side cheeks and then

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.780 
we just open up the side cheeks and then
carefully<00:02:27.750> put<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.230> pressure<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.580> way

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
carefully put in pressure all the way

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.780 
carefully put in pressure all the way
along<00:02:33.260> press<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.440> unit<00:02:34.739> into<00:02:35.010> position<00:02:35.520> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
along press the unit into position and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.140 
along press the unit into position and
then<00:02:36.480> once<00:02:36.750> you're<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.640> again<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.970> your

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
then once you're there again with your

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
then once you're there again with your
glue<00:02:44.420> run<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.630> fill<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.110> glue<00:02:46.320> across<00:02:46.440> just

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
glue run a fill it of glue across just

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.880 
glue run a fill it of glue across just
hold<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.820> gently<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.330> position

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.150 

once<00:02:52.890> that's<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.370> position<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.300> can<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
once that's in position then you can and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.759 
once that's in position then you can and
then<00:02:56.340> be<00:02:56.730> very<00:02:56.760> careful<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.810> actually

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
then be very careful with this actually

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.580 
then be very careful with this actually
run<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.190> full<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.700> glue<00:02:59.970> along<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.080> inside

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
run a full it of glue along the inside

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.740 
run a full it of glue along the inside
of<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.920> joint<00:03:02.160> here

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.650 

again<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:13.140> turn<00:03:13.380> over<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.390> same

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
again we turn over and do just the same

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.620 
again we turn over and do just the same
thing

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.170 

once<00:03:27.630> that's<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.080> position<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.910> top

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
once that's in position we have the top

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.650 
once that's in position we have the top
arches<00:03:30.690> with<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> top<00:03:31.860> cap<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.280> stone

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
arches with the top cap in stone

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.710 
arches with the top cap in stone
completely<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:33.780> position<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.920> then<00:03:38.100> be

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
completely in position this can then be

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.850 
completely in position this can then be
assembled<00:03:39.720> until<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.530> peers<00:03:40.860> as<00:03:41.660> shown<00:03:45.860> and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
assembled until you peers as shown and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.550 
assembled until you peers as shown and
there<00:03:47.010> we<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.340> basically<00:03:47.940> peak<00:03:48.870> own<00:03:49.020> arch

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
there we have basically peak own arch

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.600 
there we have basically peak own arch
viaduct<00:03:50.210> assembled

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.990 

we<00:03:54.210> have<00:03:54.390> one<00:03:54.630> actually<00:03:55.380> now<00:03:55.620> operational<00:03:56.610> on

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
we have one actually now operational on

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.330 
we have one actually now operational on
a<00:03:57.030> layout<00:03:57.390> width<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.900> think<00:03:58.200> somewhere<00:03:58.710> like<00:03:58.860> 16

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
a layout width I think somewhere like 16

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.210 
a layout width I think somewhere like 16
arches<00:03:59.760> on<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.050> realize<00:04:01.650> it's<00:04:02.010> not

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
arches on it so you can realize it's not

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.290 
arches on it so you can realize it's not
quite<00:04:02.460> as<00:04:02.640> difficult<00:04:02.820> as<00:04:03.660> people<00:04:03.930> think
