brushes<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.939> stuff<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:18.750> pretty

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
brushes and stuff I use they're pretty

brushes and stuff I use they're pretty
crappy<00:01:20.220> brushes<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.890> tend<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> go

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
crappy brushes because I just tend to go

through<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.770> make

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
through them a lot and it doesn't make

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
through them a lot and it doesn't make

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of scraping tools and a lot of floor

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.719 
of scraping tools and a lot of floor
finishing<00:01:41.939> tools<00:01:42.750> wire<00:01:43.619> brushes<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
finishing tools wire brushes and I

finishing tools wire brushes and I
divided<00:01:47.729> my<00:01:47.780> paint<00:01:48.780> table<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.530> gets

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
divided my paint table which gets

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.370

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so I'm divided into four parts oh I can

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
so I'm divided into four parts oh I can
put<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> blue<00:01:58.560> paint<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.460> corner<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.119> the

red

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
red
and<00:02:01.110> yell<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.469> could<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.070> find<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and yell so I could kind of find the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.889 
and yell so I could kind of find the
codes<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.850> want<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:04.700> do<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:06.090> experiments

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
codes I want it I do little experiments

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.050 
codes I want it I do little experiments

these<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.180> some<00:03:54.360> skills<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:55.050> found<00:03:55.290> at<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
these are some skills I found at the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.460 
these are some skills I found at the
beach<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.460> can<00:03:57.210> see<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.080> little<00:03:58.800> stone

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
beach that you can see this little stone

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.100 
beach that you can see this little stone
just<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> way<00:04:01.740> that's<00:04:01.920> broken<00:04:02.340> up<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.850> then

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
just the way that's broken up and then

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.660 
just the way that's broken up and then
you<00:04:04.110> can<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:05.820> air<00:04:06.050> sometimes<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.650> mean<00:04:08.610> I

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
you can see the air sometimes I mean I

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.540 
you can see the air sometimes I mean I
really<00:04:09.030> think<00:04:09.450> about<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.900> but<00:04:10.430> there's<00:04:11.430> a

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
really think about this but there's a

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.510 
really think about this but there's a
similarity<00:04:12.620> stuff<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.800> just<00:04:13.890> got<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.220> collect

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
similarity stuff I just got to collect

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:36.379 
similarity stuff I just got to collect
things<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.000> seem<00:04:15.270> coat<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.140> interesting

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.870 

so<00:04:37.389> what<00:04:37.540> paintings<00:04:37.900> are<00:04:38.400> there's<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.460> lot<00:04:39.699> of

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
so what paintings are there's a lot of

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.129 
so what paintings are there's a lot of
layering<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.510> them<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:42.449> lots<00:04:43.449> of<00:04:43.690> under

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
layering in them and lots of under

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.629 
layering in them and lots of under
painting<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.740> things<00:04:44.949> that<00:04:45.040> are<00:04:45.220> covered<00:04:45.550> up

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
painting and things that are covered up

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.939 
painting and things that are covered up
this<00:04:48.639> little<00:04:48.910> funny<00:04:49.600> line<00:04:49.930> that's<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.590> drawing

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
this little funny line that's a drawing

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.300 
this little funny line that's a drawing
that<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.400> glued<00:04:51.729> on<00:04:51.940> most<00:04:52.419> of<00:04:52.570> it's<00:04:52.720> been

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
that I glued on most of it's been

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.600 
that I glued on most of it's been
painted<00:04:54.310> over<00:04:54.460> now<00:04:54.760> but<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.600> kind<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.110> like<00:04:56.610> the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
painted over now but I kind of like the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.350 
painted over now but I kind of like the
history<00:04:58.090> that<00:04:58.389> is<00:04:58.600> built<00:04:58.870> up<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.880> that's<00:05:01.150> my

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
history that is built up and that's my

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.879 
history that is built up and that's my
gig<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.930> actually<00:05:02.110> gouge<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.370> surface<00:05:03.850> and

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
gig I actually gouge the surface and

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.530 
gig I actually gouge the surface and
scrape<00:05:05.889> through<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.370> colors<00:05:06.729> underneath<00:05:07.030> and

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
scrape through the colors underneath and

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.180 
scrape through the colors underneath and
then<00:05:07.690> put<00:05:07.900> colors<00:05:08.169> on<00:05:08.350> top<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:10.979> I've<00:05:11.979> been

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
then put colors on top and I've been

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.850 
then put colors on top and I've been
doing<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.460> little<00:05:12.610> bit<00:05:12.760> more<00:05:12.910> drawing<00:05:13.860> back

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
doing a little bit more drawing back

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.530 
doing a little bit more drawing back
into<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.370> painting<00:05:15.639> there's<00:05:16.030> another<00:05:16.240> piece

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800

but I'm thinking of continuing this
figure<00:05:40.190> down<00:05:40.910> into<00:05:41.330> this<00:05:41.480> area<00:05:42.040> so<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.220> is

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
figure down into this area so this is

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.240 
figure down into this area so this is
this<00:05:43.820> is<00:05:44.030> paint<00:05:44.450> that<00:05:44.750> is<00:05:44.870> quite<00:05:45.500> thick<00:05:45.950> and

this is paint that is quite thick and

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.480 
this is paint that is quite thick and
it's<00:05:46.460> dug<00:05:46.880> out<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.480> there's<00:05:48.350> color<00:05:48.920> coming

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
it's dug out and there's color coming

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.320 
it's dug out and there's color coming
through<00:05:51.100> but<00:05:52.100> underneath<00:05:52.340> which<00:05:52.820> I<00:05:53.000> kind<00:05:53.270> of

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
through but underneath which I kind of
