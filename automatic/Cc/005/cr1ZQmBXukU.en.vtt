answer<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> burn<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.180> there

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
answer right there the burn right there

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
answer right there the burn right there
volume<00:01:10.320> control<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.610> signal<00:01:11.909> light

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
volume control you got your signal light

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
volume control you got your signal light
letting<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.470> blue

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
right there
and<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.799> has<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.159> lithium-ion

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and this actually has a lithium-ion

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
and this actually has a lithium-ion
battery<00:01:17.850> inside<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> comes<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
battery inside and so it comes with a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.399 
battery inside and so it comes with a
car<00:01:20.310> charger<00:01:20.600> novel<00:01:21.600> car<00:01:21.780> charger<00:01:22.170> which
