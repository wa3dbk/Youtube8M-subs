00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.200 
pretty simple it's pretty easy to do
it's<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> other<00:01:29.820> ones<00:01:30.060> where

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's not like the other ones where

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's not like the other ones where
things<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.479> die<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.990> quick<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.770> really

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
things just die so quick they really

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
things just die so quick they really
don't<00:01:32.369> stand<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.670> chance<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.420> without

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
don't stand a chance at all without

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.010 
don't stand a chance at all without
being<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:35.009> early<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.520> um<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
being there very very early so um the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.240 
being there very very early so um the
Fate<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> follow-up<00:01:37.710> fate<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.979> actually

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Fate the follow-up fate is actually

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
Fate the follow-up fate is actually
against<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> aspect<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> chaos<00:01:39.299> who<00:01:39.450> by<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
against the aspect of chaos who by the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
against the aspect of chaos who by the
way<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.200> looks<00:01:40.409> amazing<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.220> wish<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.610> would

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
way it looks amazing i wish they would

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.280 
way it looks amazing i wish they would
use<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.000> model<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> real<00:01:42.720> boss<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
use this model as a real boss in the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
use this model as a real boss in the
game<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.740> he's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> giant<00:01:44.820> creature<00:01:45.000> that's

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
game and he's a giant creature that's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
game and he's a giant creature that's
come<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> destroy<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.290> xia<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
come to destroy all of a or xia and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
come to destroy all of a or xia and
Corran<00:01:47.070> corrupt<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.880> chaos<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.630> or

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
Corran corrupt it with chaos more or

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.969 
Corran corrupt it with chaos more or
less<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.170> that'll<00:01:49.409> destroy<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
less I think that'll destroy it in the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
less I think that'll destroy it in the
process<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.670> lightning<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.720> summon<00:01:51.960> Odin

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
process but lightning will summon Odin

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
process but lightning will summon Odin
and<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.860> most<00:01:53.040> faiths<00:01:53.340> you're

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and just like with most faiths you're

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.219 
and just like with most faiths you're
gonna<00:01:53.700> Massacre<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.750> pretty<00:01:54.990> quickly

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
gonna Massacre the thing pretty quickly

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
gonna Massacre the thing pretty quickly
I<00:01:55.380> mean<00:01:55.590> some<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:56.070> might<00:01:56.219> die<00:01:56.399> maybe<00:01:56.640> some

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
they expanded on it a little bit but it

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.590 
they expanded on it a little bit but it
would<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.880> still<00:02:18.120> would<00:02:18.209> have<00:02:18.240> been<00:02:18.390> more

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
as to why lightning was here in the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.720

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
first place you get kind of a rough idea

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.990 
first place you get kind of a rough idea
but<00:02:24.720> nothing<00:02:25.080> too<00:02:25.440> fancy<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.069> won't<00:02:26.550> spoil<00:02:26.850> it

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
on your own overall I think the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.120 
on your own overall I think the
lightning<00:02:30.209> strikes<00:02:30.480> event<00:02:30.720> was<00:02:30.810> mediocre<00:02:31.500> at

lightning strikes event was mediocre at

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.650 
lightning strikes event was mediocre at
best<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:32.910> hoping<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.630> more

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
best and I was hoping for a bit more

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.050 
best and I was hoping for a bit more
epicness<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:34.890> least<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.280> more<00:02:35.430> work<00:02:35.700> put

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
epicness and at least some more work put

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.699 
epicness and at least some more work put
into<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:37.020> now<00:02:37.110> if<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.260> haven't<00:02:37.410> finished
