00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
physics of a solar panel relies on what

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.749 
physics of a solar panel relies on what
Albert<00:01:52.520> Einstein<00:01:53.060> gained<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:54.079> Nobel<00:01:54.439> Prize<00:01:54.679> for

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
Albert Einstein gained a Nobel Prize for

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.469 
Albert Einstein gained a Nobel Prize for
in<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.060> early<00:01:56.469> 20th<00:01:57.469> century<00:01:57.529> and<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:59.270> is

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
in the early 20th century and that is

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.570 
in the early 20th century and that is
the<00:01:59.929> photoelectric<00:02:00.919> effect

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.540 

so<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.570> photoelectric<00:02:05.320> effect<00:02:08.280> relies<00:02:09.280> on

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
so the photoelectric effect relies on

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.040 
so the photoelectric effect relies on
this<00:02:10.180> idea<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:12.490> quanta<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.300> light<00:02:13.390> these

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
this idea that the quanta of light these

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.310 
this idea that the quanta of light these
photons<00:02:14.590> these<00:02:14.890> small<00:02:15.400> packets<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:16.000> energy

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
photons these small packets of energy

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.920 
photons these small packets of energy
can<00:02:17.320> be<00:02:17.470> treated<00:02:17.830> as<00:02:18.010> particles<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.940> can

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
can be treated as particles that can

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.580 
can be treated as particles that can
knock<00:02:20.230> electrons<00:02:20.950> off<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.310> atoms<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.410> you'll

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
knock electrons off of atoms so you'll

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.520 
knock electrons off of atoms so you'll
have<00:02:23.740> an<00:02:23.890> incoming<00:02:24.340> photon<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.300> an<00:02:26.080> atom

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
have an incoming photon and an atom

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.120 
have an incoming photon and an atom
inside<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.280> your<00:02:27.550> material<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:29.560> electrons

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
inside of your material with electrons

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.330 
inside of your material with electrons
that<00:02:30.340> orbit<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.850> atom<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:32.200> photon<00:02:32.680> will

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
that orbit that atom and the photon will

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.480 
that orbit that atom and the photon will
come<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:33.880> enough<00:02:34.150> energy<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.950> knock<00:02:35.950> one

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
come in with enough energy to knock one

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.590 
come in with enough energy to knock one
of<00:02:36.520> those<00:02:36.750> electrons<00:02:37.750> loose<00:02:39.450> when<00:02:40.450> this

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
of those electrons loose when this

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.560 
of those electrons loose when this
happens<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.800> negative<00:02:42.400> charged<00:02:42.850> particle

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
happens the negative charged particle

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.270 
happens the negative charged particle
will<00:02:44.320> be<00:02:45.990> will<00:02:46.990> go<00:02:47.170> towards<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.950> p-type

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.550

material<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.270> you'll<00:02:49.600> be<00:02:49.750> generating<00:02:50.380> what's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.250 
material so you'll be generating what's
called<00:02:50.860> an<00:02:51.070> electron<00:02:51.580> hole<00:02:51.790> pair<00:02:52.150> every<00:02:52.540> time

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
called an electron hole pair every time

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.430 
called an electron hole pair every time
a<00:02:53.590> photon<00:02:54.280> knocks<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.450> these<00:02:55.630> negatively

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
a photon knocks one of these negatively

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.430 
a photon knocks one of these negatively
charged<00:02:56.770> particles<00:02:57.280> off<00:02:57.930> when<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.050> do<00:02:59.200> this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
charged particles off when you do this

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.670 
charged particles off when you do this
because<00:02:59.860> of<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:00.460> gradient<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:02.350> will<00:03:02.470> have

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
because of this gradient you will have

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.640 
because of this gradient you will have
an<00:03:03.100> electric<00:03:03.850> field<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.960> electric<00:03:05.440> field

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
an electric field this electric field

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.310 
an electric field this electric field
will<00:03:06.160> cause<00:03:06.480> charge<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.750> flow<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
will cause charge to flow in a

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.340 
will cause charge to flow in a
particular<00:03:08.770> direction<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:11.140> have

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
particular direction and when you have

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.350 
particular direction and when you have
charge<00:03:11.739> flowing<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.520> generate<00:03:13.090> a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
charge flowing you can generate a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.830 
charge flowing you can generate a
current<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.860> when<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.220> have<00:03:15.520> large<00:03:15.910> solar

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
current so when you have large solar

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.490 
current so when you have large solar
panels<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:18.550> lot<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.970> fill<00:03:19.180> tons<00:03:19.420> coming<00:03:20.200> in

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
panels and a lot of fill tons coming in

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.040 
panels and a lot of fill tons coming in
and<00:03:20.739> knocking<00:03:21.040> those<00:03:21.340> electrons<00:03:21.850> off<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.840> can

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
and knocking those electrons off you can

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.380 
and knocking those electrons off you can
generate<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.860> good<00:03:24.400> amount<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.790> current<00:03:25.120> that

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
generate a good amount of current that

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.420 
generate a good amount of current that
you<00:03:25.450> can<00:03:25.720> use<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.860> generate<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.940> power<00:03:28.180> or<00:03:29.430> act

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
you can use to generate to power or act

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.050 
you can use to generate to power or act
