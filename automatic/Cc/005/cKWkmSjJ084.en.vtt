00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.750

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.029
 today I actually got home 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.779

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.579
 Why do I always put things 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 some information that is important 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.120
 for you to know I can always be there 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.590
 so I did not xeno going there but the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480
 I wanted to talk to you guys. 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.140
 a situation occurs 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 I was in the room, right, and I was 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.320
 eating with one other person and one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 another person we met arrived at 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.460
 people are in kind of a kind of a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.229
 little meeting, right? 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.729
 and then one of the girls happened 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 come to influence I can get a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.710
 chips one on the other said there washes the hand 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.619
 first nÃ© 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.630
 Before you got there , you got a little 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.490
 Thank you so much to the end but I already washed the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 my hand she went so come take it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 It's kind of funny, I ask you there. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.570
 her because she had sent me a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.220
 message on my facebook in the morning 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 I was not going to tell her because I was 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.409
 feeling bad 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.369
 my stomach was hurting there I found 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.340
 Weird to talk like that because you are me. 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.340
 did not eat in the morning that we 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.689
 I told the girl I have money. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.450
 to eat 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.850
 That's why she did not eat anything. 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.880
 desperate to ask for things 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.189
 gave me a tight heart 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.360
 At that time it was so I'm going to take everything. 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.430
 the money I had in my wallet and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.840
 I will give her to eat because I think 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.520
 holland does not have it should not have 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 received her salary do not know what 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.050
 happened it must be without card, I do not know 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.980
 several things could have happened to me 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.110
 I'll get 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.819
 It's my day, I got it. I had it. 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.319
 five dollars only in my wallet alone 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.450
 What with five dollars here in the states? 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.940
 United you can eat a little snack 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.349
 steak a sandwich with five dollars gives 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.860
 for you to eat a sandwich then 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.290
 always seems little but we can 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 eat lunch with five dollars if you want 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.569
 Eat a burger at Mac Donald's 5 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.079
 dollars is a promotion with potatoes with 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.409
 with a soda for 5 dollars and as 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.079
 in mac donald's then it is enough between 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.819
 five dollars and I gave her the 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.560
 money 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.260
 that gave me a deal with sit 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.829
 so much the better I felt I cried after 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.500
 I told you, I wonder how she does not 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.849
 had money to eat soap so the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 I was going to talk to you 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.569
 we always observe the people who 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.519
 are all around you 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.709
 the small signs they give 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.859
 people can sometimes mean a lot 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.760
 thing that maybe they do not have to 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.489
 They want to have us not wanting 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.660
 to tell you know she was embarrassed 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.150
 Suddenly I do not have the money to 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.079
 eat only that I felt she was 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.150
 need help is because I gave the 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.160
 money for her and she accepted money 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.780
 so if she really needs it 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.780
 of that money 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.380
 so start watching around you 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 In this situation these situations happen 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.700
 You know why sometimes people close 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.470
 our world closes and it can not 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.180
 to observe that sometimes people who 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.400
 are close to us are needing 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.290
 of something then that was what I 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.720
 I wanted to talk to you, try to observe 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.730
 more people around you 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.669
 observing how they wear observes 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.760
 one like her physically as that 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:02.250
 Hair connect the face as is the skin 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.299
 she suddenly needs more knows 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.549
 so try anything I tried 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.699
 observe to try to help 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.549
 people the hair has my hair for 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.949
 example is I able to buy 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.449
 a shampoo and such to treat my hair 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.430
 but what I mean if they 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.560
 sometimes they did not understand the person 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.440
 have a situation that might cause 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.479
 that she can take care of something of 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.930
 and the fact that the mine is not 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.440
 had 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.780
 To eat that, it cut my heart. 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.580
 You know, I gave her five dollars and she 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.490
 I still will, I'll give it back. 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.289
 I want it because I wanted it because it does 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.539
 It's part of me, I 'm not talking. 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.120
 This is for you because I want to 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.160
 boast and tell us how good it is not 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.889
 Is this what people share with you? 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.720
 situation because I talked to the 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.759
 rodrigo until my husband explained 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.770
 He talks you did very well because I 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.100
 I had to say I wanted to share 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.710
