that's<00:01:40.180> about<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.509> only<00:01:40.659> thing<00:01:40.869> I've<00:01:41.200> been

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that's about the only thing I've been

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.580 
that's about the only thing I've been
any<00:01:42.670> frame<00:01:43.060> time<00:01:43.720> I've<00:01:43.930> been<00:01:44.049> working<00:01:44.259> on<00:01:44.439> my

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
any frame time I've been working on my

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.300 
any frame time I've been working on my
little<00:01:44.740> engine<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:46.110> steam<00:01:47.110> engine<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:48.280> I

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
little engine and steam engine so I

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.639 
little engine and steam engine so I
think<00:01:48.580> I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:50.799> I<00:01:50.890> should<00:01:51.070> have<00:01:52.440> enough<00:01:53.440> power

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
think I think I should have enough power

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.450 
think I think I should have enough power
to<00:01:54.659> run<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.720> horsepower<00:01:58.110> hoping<00:01:59.460> they'll

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
to run a horsepower hoping they'll

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.730 
to run a horsepower hoping they'll
figure<00:02:00.700> out<00:02:00.880> how<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.259> connections

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
figure out how to make the connections

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.510 
figure out how to make the connections
well<00:02:02.950> not<00:02:03.130> yet<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.080> all<00:02:05.080> right<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.770> looks

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
well not yet but all right that looks

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:21.059 
well not yet but all right that looks
like<00:02:06.700> fun<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:08.170> yes<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.500> does

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.520 

so<00:02:22.069> that's<00:02:22.280> my<00:02:22.459> brief<00:02:22.790> update<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.269> my<00:02:24.170> rocket

so that's my brief update on my rocket

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.580 
so that's my brief update on my rocket

got that grill right there to lift it up

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.550 
got that grill right there to lift it up
now<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:46.560> piece<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.750> I'm<00:02:48.750> gonna<00:02:48.960> take<00:02:49.410> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
now this piece here I'm gonna take it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.690 
now this piece here I'm gonna take it
I'm<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.830> rebuild<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.400> gonna<00:02:50.520> make<00:02:50.670> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
I'm going to rebuild it I'm gonna make a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.090 
I'm going to rebuild it I'm gonna make a
bigger<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.510> comes<00:02:51.660> right<00:02:51.900> across<00:02:52.100> I'm

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
bigger one so it comes right across I'm

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.630 
bigger one so it comes right across I'm
gonna<00:02:53.370> drill<00:02:53.550> holes<00:02:53.760> about<00:02:54.030> halfway<00:02:54.210> down<00:02:54.480> so

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
gonna drill holes about halfway down so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.010 
gonna drill holes about halfway down so
they<00:02:56.640> can<00:02:56.790> get<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> secondary<00:02:57.450> burn<00:02:57.660> kind<00:02:57.930> of

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
they can get a secondary burn kind of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.050 
they can get a secondary burn kind of
thing<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.950> then<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.410> plate

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
thing going on and then on this plate

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.670 
thing going on and then on this plate
put<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> plate<00:03:03.360> right<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.200> I'll<00:03:04.290> cut<00:03:04.530> some

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
put the plate right on and I'll cut some

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.580 
put the plate right on and I'll cut some
holes<00:03:05.510> I'll<00:03:06.510> cut<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.690> hole<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.080> bottom<00:03:07.380> here

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
holes I'll cut a hole in the bottom here

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.770 
holes I'll cut a hole in the bottom here
so<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> air<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.460> go<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
so that the air can go in there all the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.230 
so that the air can go in there all the
time<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.260> then<00:03:11.070> here<00:03:11.550> I'll<00:03:11.850> just<00:03:12.030> drill<00:03:12.210> a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
time and then here I'll just drill a

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.730 
time and then here I'll just drill a
couple<00:03:12.390> holes<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.930> put<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> plate<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.620> I

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
couple holes and put a plate so that I

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.400 
couple holes and put a plate so that I
can<00:03:14.460> dial<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.510> amount<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> area<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.230> want

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
can dial in the amount of area I want
