probably sick is seeing each other right
but<00:03:48.340> but<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:49.230> each<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.530> them<00:03:50.739> had<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.519> huge

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
but but but each of them had a huge

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.790 
but but but each of them had a huge
impact<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.269> their<00:03:52.420> own<00:03:52.510> team<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:52.870> year<00:03:53.080> so

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
obviously Oregon State this year

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.840 
obviously Oregon State this year
probably<00:03:56.290> didn't<00:03:56.980> have<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> success<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.610> in
