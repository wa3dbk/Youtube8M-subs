00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello, back to the problem 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 corrosion on the blade 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.809
 bark river knife from firms bar career 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.000
 bravado models 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.990
 well all of you there maybe someone doesn't video about 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.580
 tom as i chose by teens blade and 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.960
 got twice so three times there 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 I was still stained by captivity 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:39.059
 Here were a lot of solutions to this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 problems but not all of these options were me 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.670
 are available so let's say or 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.469
 not everything I wanted to use but I immediately 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.590
 took away the option of polishing the film on the circle 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.230
 bakeries why because then 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.920
 lost satin coating and I would 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.579
 I did not want to try it with a rubber band 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 ordinary clerical too this is such a body 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.900
 useless and inefficient and here's an option 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 was still buy myself tires 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.890
 Japanese polisher but order us 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.229
 was on the internet in general i looked 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.340
 it costs 570 rubles there + delivery 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 in short 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.770
 gum turns gold what that's not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.680
 I began to be driven too 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 but no less brazil it somehow 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.970
 store for construction I was looking for skin 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.200
 sandpaper 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.520
 there is the smallest poverty maximum i 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 found it while 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.579
 practical as a manufacturer 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.280
 recommends sharpening the knives on us emery 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.799
 papers they have official videos on 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.039
 website posted and the same as this 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.360
 done in several parts 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.679
 Anyone interested can see 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.929
 by the way this video they sort of announced it 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.920
 competition for the best video for sharpening them 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:11.519
 knives and now there should see by 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.730
 their opinion the most suitable options 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.480
 the most clear option is how it all 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.760
 can do how to whittle a knife here 2 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.870
 thousandth sandpaper not paper 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.120
 fits there at least we need 3000 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.030
 that 2000 will two scratch the surface 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.900
 here and wandering around the store I found here 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:44.840
 such a thing is a sanding sponge 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:47.480
 abrasive size 10 from 826 she has 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 coating from silicon carbide coating 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.530
 designed for grinding polishing 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:00.269
 wooden and metal 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:05.630
 paintwork is elastic here 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:11.040
 again it and it has already been applied 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.069
 actually the abrasive layer itself together 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.549
 here p320 but honestly i don't know 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.060
 How can we compare this graininess ? 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:27.000
 with sandpaper because here it is 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:32.609
 here is a grainy 320 it is much thinner 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.370
 smaller than let's say that's 2000 emery 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.250
 papers i don't know just maybe them and 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.680
 can not be compared and honestly not 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:49.169
 I know there is still sold sponge greens 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:52.560
 terrain 80 to over forty 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.709
 Unfortunately, the lighter did not find a smaller one 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.350
 but I will tell you this option 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.910
 he rescued me very much with the help of 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.419
 Here is this here and I cleaned my lips passing 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.560
 battleship 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:12.949
 on his sword as well as being, in principle, 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:16.019
 lost nothing satin also stayed 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.979
 sponge itself to have such a hard 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.780
 elastic foundation 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.320
 Of course she is not quite firm but 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.720
 still enough. 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.669
 It will say that when polishing it is possible 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.130
 were called less often edge in principle yes 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.530
 maybe depending on how it will be polished there 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.340
 but if you crush godlessly principle yes 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:40.139
 possible but nevertheless in any case 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.780
 after processing there is putting away 5 misfortunes 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.570
 the knife is brought elementary I already have it 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.729
 did so i know what i'm saying here 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:55.440
 let's see what I got 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:59.669
 here in general here you see how satin 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:07.860
 Basically it was still stained now 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:08.819
 There is no the only what minus this inscription 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.539
 almost disappeared 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:14.040
 here bark river on from sleep on and wine barely 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.890
 barely noticeable 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:21.900
 here but it would have been written to disappear from 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:23.520
 time if the knife does not lie on the shelf if 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.600
 you use it sooner or later 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.600
 stains appear you'll clean up and so 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.470
 as here and when sharpening the same 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.920
 like a lens 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.550
 that is . here and here the whole surface 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.150
 the inscription sooner or later you're honest well for 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.460
 it is as if I am not afraid of our 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.880
 I saw the workers myself, I go with him and 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.840
 into the woods and hack and everything is all there and doing 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.750
 I am very pleased with the knife and this is the problem 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.510
 which I managed to decide to remove 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.550
 5 that is, the legend could primordial 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.370
 the original look of me is very 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:06.270
 pleased that is possible with this knife 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:11.040
 enjoy without fear that you have it 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:16.560
 there will be unsightly look like this 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:19.650
 I actually cleaned the spots now I tell you 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.000
 show can be a little sloppy because 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.810
 that in front of me is the camera is not very 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.210
 convenient here the trick is that he needs 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.230
 do the same movements ie 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.790
 there can not be in different directions its circular 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.590
 by movement 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:41.820
 movements are needed here is the campaign that's how it goes 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:43.790
 I see this cyanide from them 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:50.130
 we cleaned 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:52.490
 stains are chosen the same with this 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.490
 parties 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:13.050
 You can do this in management 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:27.340
 everything here is, in principle, everything is fine here in 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:31.390
 in general, such is such a useful thing 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:35.380
 I think it is worth such a sponge on Tula 35 42 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:38.680
 rubles for such money such a result 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.440
 me very very ceremonial principle all 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.600
 all sharp knives, I completely say goodbye 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.320
 subscribe to the channel to everyone 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.320
 good bye
