00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.809
 for tractor and for motoblock show 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.259
 your debts are developed then you have funds 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.490
 there is 4 5 6 strong walk- in tractor this in 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.189
 mostly as an annual 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.919
 landing also want to type bolts again 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:27.759
 school fixer fix went 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:31.480
 adjustment of the whole garden 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.660
 Well, the volume there is 15 cm from 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.660
 volume volume tiller yes that is to say 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.520
 heavy tiller 8 12 strong it's in 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.040
 mainly up to 05 06 to 50 50 acres can 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.710
 make but one ice plow I 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:01:00.969
 I think in principle for a few days you can 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:01:04.119
 no how much up to half a hectare 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.340
 Ie 50 honeycomb this yes this this this strong 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.560
 security forces nerves effort but mostly 1 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.420
 liter empty plow grab he is here 15 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.149
 20 centimeters you will pass in a day not 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 I know the day behind the day for 8 hours 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.770
 principle, can I have another lead 50 hundredths 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.090
 this psychological barrier 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.229
 here plow more in detail that is me 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.009
 there is a walker 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.300
 Omich he has a club I have them until 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:37.869
 somewhat younger was not so there just 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:40.240
 why the hell is that why 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.520
 look first when you go with 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.970
 block but what is in you the plow is not 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.850
 center 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.280
 news are biasing its adhesive washi yes 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.509
 left or right here using 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.540
 gear and you 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.060
 turn over i mean you offset is coming 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.460
 from the center falling through and for example 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.640
 land and also you can adjust the angle 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 want to raise that is there i'm on some 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 oak tree 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.750
 so that the services you have not broken wound not 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.750
 raised already done heel 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.959
 as in all normal meadows done 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 the heel is something that will go smoothly and not 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.430
 wag even if you use easy 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 walker that is it is some 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.420
 some special linkage for this 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.370
 finalized refinement for use 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.410
 already with above the clouds because well 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 interesting map used as it is on 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.920
 practice 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.540
 because set up a club but matt 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.290
 dip then it is very difficult there 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.780
 this such disagree agree can 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.000
 be bidding for traper it for tractor 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.110
 for fucking 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.840
 and so 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.290
 at the doctor those apply more therefore 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.080
 such a perfect system is already underway 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.510
 There is our similar type but their already two 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.000
 that is, he takes no longer 15-20 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.310
 centimeters 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.210
 35-40 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.130
 about pashki also you regulate that is 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.670
 put it on the right side of it 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.670
 mechanism 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.300
 shift left and right 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.950
 This clarification did not understand so one more thing 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.590
 look here he is with us now yes 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.970
 that's strictly horizontal to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.670
 equal at one time I fixed the center here too 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.700
 horizontal plane well i'm as far as 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.950
 I understand at least the tractor even the walker when 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.170
 I always went right wheel 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.989
 He walks into a bar Zef plowed that is itself 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.730
 himself a tractor he goes me like this either 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 right or left in the back of the rosette 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.840
 I have a wheel 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.890
 services habits days on 4 it 's still 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.860
 the right to rob 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.660
 Here, respectively, I have a tractor 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.690
 it will be like this 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.239
 will be too so on those I regulate it in 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.000
 The template I brought so not shift it 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.390
 you are judged by the rights wheel and they just 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.200
 that is, and Iâ€™m not going at all dad though 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.860
 my goal I go on virgin soil here I give you 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.880
 I advise 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.990
 and he will be the wheel of the city hotel 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.430
 goes for the right wheel and on them 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.090
 here you are the center of the tractor here it is on the right 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.610
 wheel 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.890
 so here I am talking about what if I go TPP 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.660
 ra do for this yes i will give i am a tractor 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.060
 here so if I go over the snow on 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.790
 untidy theaters exactly a minute then 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.590
 grandchildren ie right here i turned i go 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.250
 on virgin soil on tilled and bad for me 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.710
 goes near and smells something up to 100 people 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.330
 completed and the solution is great 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.810
 here 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.400
 I do not know 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.850
 I myself also like the idea 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.580
 adjustment is this angle and so I 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.180
 you can flood here it is pressed down 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 on tractor hydraulics let us have you 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.169
 put him down as far as we landed 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.980
 subside they took 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.710
 You've been drinking hydraulics for a long time 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.470
 no and between hydraulics missed true 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.540
 visit one will press another 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.060
 we sold for floating mode got 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:06.370
 Hydraulic cylinder mode is worth it so 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:09.100
 and all and why can not the tractor goes 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.770
 bumps ricotta yes yes imagine 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.200
 this one is in front of me if I have a hard time 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.790
 I crushed and chuck a lot in front 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.730
 wheels stepped on some knoll 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.520
 I move through the log in general 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.530
 for pushing the club ground vitamix someone 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.690
 there is scrap expensive to regulate walls 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.880
 castle de randy but me no matter 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.130
 on how the tractor otherwise it is no longer 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.300
 by and vice versa i have a front end in a calya 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.350
 dived plow pulled out of the ground 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.000
 understand all the stones just balance 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.760
 of course will not go down there there 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.770
 where do we take the floating date mode 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.960
 Leash is not easy. 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.420
 the fact that the half-breeds, and so that's 2 tour 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.980
 hearing 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.590
 rarely 40 30 kilogram item 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.320
 I mean that he is not thrown out of the ground 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:06:00.980
 when you walk by 6 walk-behind tractor I understand 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:03.020
 took these long levers yes from the doctor 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.270
 when i go floating mode you already 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.520
 throw or orbiz attack angle he 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.350
 buried yes clone to adjusted 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.850
 explodes and the wheels are no longer in horse 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.410
 provided which depth 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.150
 the importance of adjusting the recipe is just 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.409
 adjust 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.689
 here he went yes 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.409
 from everywhere put tass or so out of it 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.409
 general Cherkasy 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:28.869
 but places are china and guts under 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.869
 where to bomb China from a member to come on 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.869
 Well done
