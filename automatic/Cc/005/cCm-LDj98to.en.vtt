 social media or add it to your 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.460
 favorites so they always have it to 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.289
 hand when they get a shot of 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.360

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.059
 shows is a tray for cookies with 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.730
 waxed paper a mold for cupcakes 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.620
 this is from iker they are a little bit taller 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.079
 and thin that the cupcake molds 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.450
 can use a pop-over mold 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.940
 or of law can not use a mount 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.480
 for cupcakes but this one gives them better that 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.309
 effect of cups I have a mold of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.149
 silicone to make my spoons of 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.180
 White chocolate 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.270
 this is optional 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.890
 a non-stick spray roller one 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.680
 Angled spatula can use a 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.980
 knife a spoon here I have a few 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.210
 pieces of waxed paper already cut out 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.580
 here I have a third of cookie dough 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.860
 oreo I leave the link for this recipe 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.080
 in the descriptive space below was 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.030
 our previous tutorial I like 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.130
 work with one piece of dough at a time 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.580
 because it's easier to use and it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.830
 keeps chilled dark chocolate melted 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.840
 melted white chocolate a mini 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.640
 Orios for decoration two cutters 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.500
 circular cookies I mention them 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.330
 the measurements in the descriptive space 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.640
 down a little bit of flour all use 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.210
 oreo ground cookies and some rice 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.440
 raw 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.660
 I have cream to beat in my 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.940
 refrigerator to decorate my shows today 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.950
 let's start they must take out the mass of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.780
 refrigerator where you have been by little 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 more than an hour so it's pretty 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.490
 Firm kneads it for 30 seconds at a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.440
 minute are not a generous amount of 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.360
 flour on the table press the dough 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.369
 over it and stretch it with your roller 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.590
 which were quite thin a couple of 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.270
 mm is perfect they grab your mold 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.310
 for cupcakes and they looked generously 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.590
 Make sure the cooking spray 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.280
 spray a good 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.189
 particularly in the background and 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.050
 corners now I use the small cutter 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.840
 of cookies that has the same size 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.849
 of the bottom of no of cut the mass and 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.099
 he placed it directly at the bottom of the 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.140
 these molds are going to be the basis of the 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.360
 cups with a knife or spatula 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.790
 cut out a rectangle that does not have to 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.560
 be perfect place it inside the mold 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.630
 and with the side floured out and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.519
 they press it with their thumb on this 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.680
 way the piece should come out of the mold 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.230
 here I stay a space so 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.420
 I just add a bit of this 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.420
 side and they press it well with their fingers 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.950
 with his spatula cut in the excess that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.790
 protrudes to give a smooth edge to your 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.620
 cookie cup 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.780
 repeat the process in us 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.120
 molds making sure to press 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.640
 well the sides with your fingers and that you 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.560
 connect with the circular base for 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.239
 cookie plastics take a second 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.549
 third of the cookie dough and one 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.560
 once more the dough and then stretch it up 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.109
 that is thin and using the cutter 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.959
 large circular cut out circles 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.090
 place them gently on your tray 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.639
 to bake then with the edge more 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.470
 chubby from your small cutter press 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.079
 in the center of large circles 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.389
 taking care not to cross it what 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.970
 they want is to print one more circle 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.430
 small in the center of his talk to 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.370
 hold the house 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.099
 they are taken to the preheated 350 oven 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.219
 degrees Fahrenheit to 175 degrees celsius 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.159
 8 to 10 minutes for the shots fix 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:39.090
 inside a square of waxed paper 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.090
 forming like a cup 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.180
 pressing with my finger inside my 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 cookie shows I like to do this 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.590
 because it helps maintain the shape 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.790
 perfect of the cups since some 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.790
 they could come off 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.700
 the fillings with the raw rice I like 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.980
 use rice when I bake in this way 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.770
 then I have baked for 10 minutes 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.930
 later I take out the mold I take away the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.520
 waxed paper with the rice and I return it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.520
 Baked for another 5 minutes more 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.100
 already spent the first 10 minutes like this 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.260
 I gently take out the waxed paper 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.260
 taking care not to leave the rice 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.680
 once they have emptied all the 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:27.689
 back to the oven for another five 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.360
 minutes to finish baking pse 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:33.000
 with the plastics when removing them from the oven 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.280
 and when they are still hot I grab a 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.770
 glass with a base the same size as 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.939
 circle of the platico and can see that 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.939
 he pressed firmly 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.470
 This is better defined by the cleft 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.990
 I talk in this way holds the best 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.969
 the sun and also look more authentic 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.280
 once the saucers are totally 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.120
 cold I cover them with dark chocolate 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.120
 melted 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.580
 I cover this and then I shake it 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.740
 vigorously allowing the excess 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.819
 fall and that I created a layer of chocolate 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.819
 smooth and soft 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.949
 use your index finger to pass it over 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.260
 the edge and give it a nice finish and 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.389
 they have some shiny plastics as if 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.250
 they were ceramic when they take out the 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.860
 mold of the steps of the oven 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.560
 let them be for 5 minutes and take them out 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.540
 these are still warm to leave them for 5 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.030
 minutes allows them to be easier to 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.380
 I take them out of the mountain gently and 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.380
 pressing with my thumb 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.570
 Now I'm going to teach you quickly how 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.580
 making teaspoons is not usual 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.200
 everyone has at home a mold of 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.420
 these from louis pretty easy to 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.400
 just get it filled with the 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.409
 melted white chocolate very much of 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.659
 do not fill the outer edges 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.849
 I tap on the table 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.589
 to fill any chocolate 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.589
 space inside the teaspoons 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.910
 they are taken to the refrigerator until 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.130
 harden 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.990
 It is important that they cover the part 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.390
 inside of his shorts because when he 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.880
 milk they are going to soak and they 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.500
 everything will come out so you want a couple of 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.320
 teaspoons white chocolate 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.380
 melted and they go around to create 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.880
 an inner layer on beauty 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.270
 make sure it covers the whole part 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.670
 internal of yours up to the edges what 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.120
 turn and shake so that the 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.890
 excess serves in some dark space it 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.060
 they throw a little more white chocolate 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.060
 to cover it 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.430
 and while the white chocolate is still 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.770
 wet press his mouth down on the 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.950
 oreo boronas to adhere in 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.140
 all the top ring of his show repeat 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.030
 the process with each of his shows and 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.520
 I urge you to take care that the part 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.050
 interior is completely covered with 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.080
 the white chocolate to make them 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.210
 waterproof the spoons are already 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.759
 firm and ready look how pretty they are 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:09.100
 they soften the sides with their fingers 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:12.610
 to remove any excess 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.920
 they place them on their plastics fill 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.040
 his shorts with milk without reaching the 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.040
 edge 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:24.490
 and they finish filling it with whipped cream 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.770
 I did a test to see how long 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.930
 they last the waterproof shots that they see 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.570
 in the corner of the screen has been 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.300
 there like for 4 hours so they stay 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.030
 completely waterproof and they are not going to 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.430
 filter some whipped cream spray 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.070
 some boronas of ore above and there 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.870
 They have a full edible tableware 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.390
 with his chocolate spoon and a 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.460
 spectacular oreo cookie show 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.710
 I hope friends who have 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.870
 delighted my version of this new fashion 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.060
 of the shots make sure to share it 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.310
 so that others also enjoy them and 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.150
 thank you very much for tuning in with me 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.150
 addiction to cupcakes
