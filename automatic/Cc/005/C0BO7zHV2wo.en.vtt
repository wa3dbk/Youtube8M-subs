00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.880
 day to all you guys this you see 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.570
 my duel of yu gi oh 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.210
 as you can see this silver part is the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.070
 portal that we say and and to a closure in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 Scotch tape 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.359
 here I will show you that in order not to do 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.939
 run off the cards 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 otherwise if you didn't have this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.300
 protection 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.140
 when you do this because for sure 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.160
 move your 2 list they will all come out 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 the papers and for this he says about this 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 protection 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.030
 let's start from the right here is the space for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.660
 the extra dec 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 as you can see while here on the left a little 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.360
 all these spaces are more sinister 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.829
 whites allow the cards you can 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.949
 put in attack position 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.750
 as you see from this this form with 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.940
 what am I doing 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 or defense position that it would be 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.330
 this is very simple to do them 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.130
 just take a sheet of course 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.520
 make the measurement of your cards in 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.840
 vertical than horizontal and then do 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 these little ones there are these things in here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 card because if you put the card 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.200
 so here the paper can do this 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.960
 movement that could also give a little 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.259
 of annoyance and I have created these i 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.500
 the spouts say small to block them 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.930
 and so they don't do anything about gambling it is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.810
 this here and for all the papers then 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 we turn our 2 list and here we have 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.350
 we see that we have a cuff for 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.230
 put in the hand that is the short e 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.410
 keep them in your hands like that 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.120
 and here we have some in the papers where 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.910
 place the card traps cards 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.950
 cards covered art traps cards e 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.900
 magic also with scotch closure 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.930
 because as you see they have an opening 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.910
 he had to put the cards in and for 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.880
 avoid that the cards come out enough 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.310
 closing so the cards are no longer e 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.960
 this heart all the part below 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.020
 I made it black as a background 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.350
 at first I had these spaces here with a 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.320
 piece of paper that kept him holding 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.770
 attached to the cards, however, was not very 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:46.230
 a genius and I decided to create these yes 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.330
 bring cards here I had intuition of 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.660
 put another box similar to this one 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.370
 to put the cemetery cards 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.180
 but I still have to think about how to do it 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.250
 because normally no idea and if 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.070
 want 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.240
 in description of themes maybe some 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.280
 idea or some other video on what to do 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.100
 and even here on the extra dark you could 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.400
 make another little box so a little more 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.920
 high maybe closed like this guy but 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.950
 this is the cardboard here 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.459
 first of all the web of sky cardboard 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.120
 while these card holders are made of paper 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.280
 you could do the extra tech door 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.910
 a kart in the place to do it in cardboard is a 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.300
 difficult and always do it in height 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.180
 quite superior to your cards 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.040
 of the former of the street because no one knows 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.450
 never that maybe you open a packet of 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.780
 yu cards already oh 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.290
 and maybe a monster will come out of you 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.709
 like you have to put it in the extra depp it is 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 in short, for this video it's all if not 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.140
 you understand something 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.320
 ask me in description and thanks e 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.320
 see you later
