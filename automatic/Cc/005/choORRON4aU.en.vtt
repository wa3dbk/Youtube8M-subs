00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
going to happen eventually but I'd like

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.859

to get the cleanest pair if I'm still

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380 
to get the cleanest pair if I'm still
playing<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> same<00:01:58.259> money<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:59.030> think<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
playing the same money I think that's a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.660 
playing the same money I think that's a
little<00:02:00.479> different<00:02:00.750> there's<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.670> somewhat

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
little different there's like a somewhat

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.670 
little different there's like a somewhat
translucent<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.750> translucent<00:02:04.409> but

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
translucent not really translucent but

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.069 
translucent not really translucent but
uh<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.280> guess<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
uh I guess not really just a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.369 
uh I guess not really just a
cool-looking<00:02:07.469> sole<00:02:08.929> yeah<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.259> actually

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
cool-looking sole yeah if I was actually

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.780 
cool-looking sole yeah if I was actually
going<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> boat<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.039> wouldn't<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.550> wear

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
going on a boat I wouldn't really wear

going on a boat I wouldn't really wear
these<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.690> little
