it might be a little tiny we'll see so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.180 
it might be a little tiny we'll see so
it's<00:01:14.869> long<00:01:15.049> sleeves<00:01:15.440> it's<00:01:15.770> really<00:01:16.009> nice

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's long sleeves it's really nice

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.090 
it's long sleeves it's really nice
outside<00:01:16.399> but<00:01:17.360> um<00:01:17.570> there's<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.869> breeze<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
outside but um there's a breeze so the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.130 
outside but um there's a breeze so the
long<00:01:19.250> sleeves<00:01:19.520> will<00:01:19.640> be<00:01:19.729> just<00:01:19.910> fine<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.050> then

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
long sleeves will be just fine and then

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.540 
long sleeves will be just fine and then
I'll<00:01:21.289> put<00:01:21.470> these<00:01:21.590> little<00:01:21.860> cute<00:01:22.130> preemie

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
I'll put these little cute preemie

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.889 
I'll put these little cute preemie
shorts<00:01:22.789> on<00:01:22.910> him<00:01:23.060> because<00:01:23.240> shorts<00:01:23.720> weren't

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
shorts on him because shorts weren't

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.109 
shorts on him because shorts weren't
really<00:01:24.110> big<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.369> think<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.640> preemies<00:01:26.000> are

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
really big and I think the preemies are

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.719 
really big and I think the preemies are
going<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.300> fit<00:01:26.450> him<00:01:26.570> well<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:28.250> then<00:01:28.399> he<00:01:28.550> will

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
going to fit him well and then he will

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.230 
going to fit him well and then he will
have<00:01:28.970> shoes<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:30.050> wear<00:01:30.190> he's<00:01:31.190> adorable<00:01:31.700> tiny

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
in the video and so I'm hoping that I've

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.700 
in the video and so I'm hoping that I've
sealed<00:02:58.720> them<00:02:58.960> good<00:02:59.140> enough<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.560> like

sealed them good enough that like

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.520 
sealed them good enough that like
pushing<00:03:00.130> them<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.430> will<00:03:00.790> be<00:03:00.910> just<00:03:01.210> fine<00:03:01.530> for

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
pushing them in will be just fine for

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.840 
pushing them in will be just fine for
silicon<00:03:02.860> because<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.280> kind<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.550> different

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
silicon because it's kind of different

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.040 
silicon because it's kind of different
with<00:03:03.940> silicon<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.910> that's<00:03:07.270> all<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.810> stuff

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
with silicon so that's all the stuff

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.470 
with silicon so that's all the stuff
that<00:03:08.380> Dakota<00:03:10.080> will<00:03:11.080> need<00:03:11.290> when<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> get<00:03:11.800> him

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
waiting anxiously I'm afraid to go

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.349 
waiting anxiously I'm afraid to go
anywhere<00:04:02.640> because<00:04:02.849> I<00:04:02.970> don't<00:04:03.090> want<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.269> miss
