00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.529
 have you thought about what would happen if you 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.230
 will create a black hole near the 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.509
 land because there is already a device that 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.939
 believes that it can cause the creation of a 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.520
 black hole that would end up absorbing 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.439
 to the earth prepare to listen 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.080
 on the particle accelerator 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.080
 lh ce we started 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.810
 in Europe was created by scientists in 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.150
 the hc that is the accelerator and 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.530
 larger particle collider 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.900
 of the world 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.140
 its goal is to accelerate the particles and 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.970
 make them collide at very high speed 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.940
 inside the collider they are 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.720
 two proton beams that are accelerated 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.280
 in opposite directions until reaching the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.020
 99.9 percent of the speed of the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.840
 light and they are made to hit each other 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.479
 producing very high energies at scales 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.670
 subatomic that would simulate 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.820
 some events that happened immediately 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.860
 after the big bang but a group of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.479
 scientists filed a complaint 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.090
 the european court of rights 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.610
 humans in Strasbourg to stop the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.310
 start of the particle accelerator l 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.030
 hc before the danger that generates 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.369
 black holes 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.380
 the complaint was signed by several 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.960
 scientists including the professor of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.250
 German biochemistry and chaos theory or 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.560
 don rouzier 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.480
 there were two theories that explained what 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.540
 could happen to the earth in case of 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.210
 that the accelerator started saying that 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.729
 when the lhc went into operation 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.040
 could create a black hole that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.290
 will literally swallow the planet 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.930
 the other says that it could originate a 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.300
 strange stuff that would turn the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.840
 earth in a neutron star without 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.480
 life but if we combine both theories it 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.650
 generates a probability of 75 per 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.390
 hundred that the hc ends with the earth 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.240
 a group of scientists affirmed that the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.460
 accelerator on the hc is like playing with the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.460
 Russian roulette but with two bars 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.820

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.960
 added in your social networks so that 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.450
 always be aware we'll see you in the
