the<00:01:19.860> bottom<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:21.390> process<00:01:22.970> then<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.119> can

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the bottom this process then you can

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.230 
the bottom this process then you can
just<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.740> extract<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.130> oil<00:01:26.159> water<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
just use extract the oil water and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.999 
just use extract the oil water and
vomits<00:01:27.780> simply<00:01:28.470> by<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.310> layer<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.850> on

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
vomits simply by just what layer is on

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.530 
vomits simply by just what layer is on
with<00:01:32.009> both<00:01:32.220> these<00:01:32.460> processes<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.240> very

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
with both these processes it's very

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
with both these processes it's very
beneficial<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:34.320> both<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.189> not

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
beneficial because both of them do not

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.240 
beneficial because both of them do not
use<00:01:36.000> chemicals<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:37.710> their<00:01:37.920> extraction

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
use chemicals in their extraction

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.090 
use chemicals in their extraction

previously I have to relied on for a
long<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.880> separate<00:01:45.570> algae<00:01:46.409> oil<00:01:46.439> from<00:01:47.220> the

long time to separate algae oil from the
algal<00:01:47.700> biomass<00:01:49.189> chemicals<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.600> not<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.930> best

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
algal biomass chemicals are not the best

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.520 
algal biomass chemicals are not the best
because<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.909> add<00:01:54.060> additional<00:01:54.450> cost<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
because they add additional cost to the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130 
because they add additional cost to the
extraction<00:01:55.829> process<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.960> had

if you use chemicals you will most

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.559 
if you use chemicals you will most
likely<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.459> remove<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.700> chemicals<00:02:12.209> from

this also adds additional costs and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.750 
this also adds additional costs and

on both the cost as well as additional

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.020 
on both the cost as well as additional
steps<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.180> take<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:41.580> both<00:02:41.790> these

steps you have to take and in both these

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
steps you have to take and in both these
cases<00:02:42.650> they<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.680> reduced<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.580> cost<00:02:45.530> greatly

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
cases they have reduced the cost greatly

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.680 
cases they have reduced the cost greatly
