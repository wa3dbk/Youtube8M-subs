00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
earlier the raised bed here was built up

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.410

with<00:01:52.989> blocks<00:01:53.890> over<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.429> concrete<00:01:54.789> foundation

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
and then it was faced off with dry stone

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
a dry stone effect but it gives it the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
a dry stone effect but it gives it the
stability<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.849> standard<00:02:07.209> war<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:09.190> Cap'n

that<00:02:10.840> goes<00:02:11.019> all<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.260> way<00:02:11.410> around<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.950> just

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
that goes all the way around is just

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.449 
that goes all the way around is just
sandstone<00:02:13.209> same<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.040> wall<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.190> stone

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
sandstone same as the wall and stone

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.509 
sandstone same as the wall and stone
which<00:02:16.450> was<00:02:16.660> hand<00:02:16.959> cut<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> roughly

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
which was hand cut to a roughly

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.690 
which was hand cut to a roughly
semi-circular<00:02:19.450> sort<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.110> ship<00:02:20.319> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
semi-circular sort of a ship and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.960 
semi-circular sort of a ship and
cemented<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.329> vertical<00:02:22.629> position

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
cemented on in the vertical position

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.970 
cemented on in the vertical position
just<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.180> mirrors<00:02:25.480> what<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.840> see<00:02:26.049> all

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
just so it mirrors what you see all

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.390 
just so it mirrors what you see all
around<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.400> UK<00:02:27.579> also<00:02:28.299> when<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> nola<00:02:28.660> suppose

in a way of dry stone walls did he ask
it<00:02:33.940> was<00:02:34.840> built<00:02:35.079> cemented<00:02:36.010> together<00:02:36.130> again

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
it was built cemented together again

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.410
