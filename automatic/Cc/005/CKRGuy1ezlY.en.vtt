 although I would be willing to do anything 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.550
 if not 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.800
 lindsey vonn 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.800
 a singular 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.330
 alcorcÃ³n 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 I had not had to save him only because he missed me 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.180
 there was a time when any pirate was free to take his own 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.760
 dark brown 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 exposition 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.900
 anyone who sees it like that after four attempts to isolate the team does not

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.040

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.399
 the lords of piracy 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 after committing the crime 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 know they face extinction 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 only remains to know where they will arrive their last battle 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.879
 if it's you that this never happened
