00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi to all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
 this new video in which I will show you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 all the news that apple has introduced 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.929
 in ayers 8.3 beta 1 2 and 3 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.929
 let's not waste time and start right away 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 well on this iphone 5 I installed from 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.230
 little ios 8.3 beta 3 and since in mine 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.630
 channel I had not yet made a video 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.340
 summary of the novelties of this ios 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 I take this opportunity to show you the news 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.469
 of the beta 1 2 3 all in one video 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 well we start shipped because the news 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.520
 they are not many but they are interesting 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
 first we start with two functions 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.200
 that I can't show you a concern 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.940
 carpi ray the system of integration between 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.219
 iphone or ipad with a car 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.280
 obviously the machine must support 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 such technology that with ios 8.3 not 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 will require more cable presence 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.829
 physical to connect the iphone to the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 car but it will be completely without 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 wires and another function that unfortunately 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.449
 I can't show you that in ayers 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.939
 8.3 support has been added 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.610
 complete google on step 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799
 verification then to the new system of 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.939
 secure verification in 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.890
 google account 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.420
 technical stuff that we no longer care about 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.369
 of so much said this we pass to the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.250
 the first thing that comes to me 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 it seems mandatory to show you is the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.100
 presence of a complete set 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 renewed icons of emoticons indeed 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.659
 by activating the emoji keyboard you see that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.640
 here primarily the same keyboard is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.460
 changed it seems to me much more like 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.070
 that of mac osx moans and then you see 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.829
 that there are plenty of new icons 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.259
 ready to be used I don't know if 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.360
 you have also heard a kind of 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.909
 controversy with these icons we will talk about it 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.680
 in a very short time now I will give you vi 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.689
 I actually show the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.119
 new sliding method that now 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.430
 treats all these sub-categories as 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.740
 if they were an album to browse through you see 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.939
 in fact that the more I go on the lower from 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 one category to another 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.110
 frankly I prefer this method 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.909
 compared to the previous one instead 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.560
 he was a little awkward I'm sure 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.360
 taking the hand with this new one 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.360
 sliding system will be all very 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.610
 more fluid also because all 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.380
 the first tab remains on the left 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.330
 so we can always keep track of 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.190
 all emoticons is the one mentioned 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.280
 I was talking before you see that now 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.710
 People icons have the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.480
 possibility to be differentiated by 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.370
 skin color so we can 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.020
 choose whether to use the icon for 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.760
 example of this of this man of 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.190
 this guy with the most coloring 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.810
 light darker etc. we will be able to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.640
 choose from six different types 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.830
 this fact has generated a little bit 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.959
 a scandal you know those scandals that 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.270
 they are born just to make people talk about them 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.160
 because there are those who have not appreciated this 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.020
 apple choice I frankly have it 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.690
 found one more thing that one can 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.430
 use or can venice or not use vi 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.380
 I also wanted to show that they were 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.840
 changed three of the emoticons already 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.000
 existing in fact the watch was 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.980
 replaced the iPhone with the Apple Watch 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.560
 that was there before that it looked like an iphone 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.290
 2g was finally replaced with 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.959
 the iphone 6 emoticon and the computer 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.690
 has been replaced with a real one 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.540
 imac and in miniature then you are apple 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.820
 custom personalized his 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.890
 same icons that I also find a lot 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.390
 better than before, very very beautiful then 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.510
 that was all there was to it 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.900
 tell about how emoticons have changed 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.580
 now on this new ios 8.3 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.739
 to the next news that I find 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.860
 really useful i liked this 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.110
 novelty that has been introduced appropriate 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.440
 8.3 beta 3 which allows to filter i 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.390
 imessage messages from people 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.799
 that we do not have three contacts 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.870
 let me explain better you see that it is me 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.180
 a message arrived from a number that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.130
 this iphone has no three contacts 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.690
 obviously obscured the number because yes 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.100
 it's my personal number 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.200
 so we see that this is about 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.019
 an imessage message then the sender 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.690
 between what might spam quotes 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.880
 he wants because the imessages are free 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.470
 and therefore I could continue to receive 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930
 messages from these individual without 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.600
 know who actually is good from 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.799
 message settings there will be this 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.269
 new entry that allows you to filter the 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.160
 conversations what it means to filter 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.350
 first of all, see the conversations 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.570
 must be enabled then we go immediately to 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.450
 activate it this list filter is here 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.360
 conversations that allows 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.940
 to move to a separate category 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.070
 all the conversations imessage then 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.320
 does not work with text messages only with 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.570
 the imessages of people we don't have 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.270
 among the contacts as you see here we will have the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.220
 first section called contacts and sms 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.750
 where precisely there will be people who 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.940
 we have between contacts or people 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.940
 unknown but contact us 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.680
 via normal sms and then the section with 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.260
 filter that contains all the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.760
 imessage conversations with people who 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.590
 we don't have three contacts 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.170
 I personally find this function 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.390
 really smart and interesting 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.230
 let me also know what you think 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.660
 and last but not least, ios 8.3 beta 3 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.300
 finally this beta also supports 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.000

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.390
