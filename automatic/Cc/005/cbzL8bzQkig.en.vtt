00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.379 

the<00:00:00.930> first<00:00:01.170> thing<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.829> guess<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.700> skeleton<00:00:03.240> of

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
the first thing I guess the skeleton of

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.320 
the first thing I guess the skeleton of
the<00:00:03.480> whole<00:00:04.100> thing<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.460> frame<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.029> Machine

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
the whole thing is the frame the Machine

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.980 
the whole thing is the frame the Machine
frame<00:00:07.069> so<00:00:08.069> basically<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.559> comprised<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.950> a

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
frame so basically it's a comprised of a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.379 
frame so basically it's a comprised of a
tube<00:00:12.990> vise<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.160> where<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.580> tube

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
tube vise here this is where the tube

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.779 
tube vise here this is where the tube
that<00:00:15.509> holds<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.809> needle<00:00:16.049> goes<00:00:16.230> into<00:00:16.789> your

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that holds the needle goes into your

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
that holds the needle goes into your
front/rear<00:00:18.420> binding<00:00:18.900> post<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.770> where

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
front/rear binding post this is where

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880 
front/rear binding post this is where
the<00:00:20.039> armature<00:00:20.490> bar<00:00:20.640> attaches<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.990> your

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the armature bar attaches to and your

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.700 
the armature bar attaches to and your
front<00:00:23.250> binding<00:00:23.640> post<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.300> then<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
front binding post and then you have

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
front binding post and then you have
some<00:00:25.890> holes<00:00:26.130> drilled<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> frame<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.240> for

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
some holes drilled in the frame here for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.019 
some holes drilled in the frame here for
your<00:00:27.539> coils<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> these<00:00:29.429> are<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> Machine

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
your coils so these are the Machine

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.430 
your coils so these are the Machine
coils<00:00:31.099> basically<00:00:32.450> current<00:00:33.450> goes<00:00:33.690> through<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
coils basically current goes through the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
coils basically current goes through the
coils<00:00:34.950> charging<00:00:35.850> these<00:00:35.969> little

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
coils charging these little

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.440 
coils charging these little
electromagnets<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:38.520> pulls<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> armature

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
electromagnets and it pulls the armature

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.860 
electromagnets and it pulls the armature
bar<00:00:39.629> forward<00:00:40.379> against<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.660> pulls

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bar forward against them and as it pulls

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.569 
bar forward against them and as it pulls
it<00:00:43.020> forward<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.700> rear<00:00:45.270> spring<00:00:46.579> or

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it forward this little rear spring or

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.760 
it forward this little rear spring or
the<00:00:47.610> front<00:00:47.850> spring<00:00:48.649> breaks<00:00:49.649> contact<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
the front spring breaks contact so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.049 
the front spring breaks contact so
basically<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.899> oscillates<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.280> opening

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
basically it oscillates you know opening

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
basically it oscillates you know opening
and<00:00:57.239> closing<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> circuit<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> that's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and closing the circuit here and that's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.889 
and closing the circuit here and that's
what<00:00:58.890> makes<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.309> machine<00:00:59.640> work<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.270> coils

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
what makes the machine work the coils

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.939 
what makes the machine work the coils
being<00:01:01.940> intermittently<00:01:02.940> charged<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
being intermittently charged and

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.789 
being intermittently charged and
creating<00:01:04.949> an<00:01:05.180> electromagnetic<00:01:06.180> field<00:01:06.479> that

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
creating an electromagnetic field that

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.850 
creating an electromagnetic field that
pulls<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.159> armature<00:01:09.000> bar<00:01:09.180> back<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> forth<00:01:10.040> so

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
pulls the armature bar back and forth so

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.630 
pulls the armature bar back and forth so
these<00:01:13.860> coils<00:01:14.340> attach<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> frame<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.350> on

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
these coils attach to the frame here on

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.789 
these coils attach to the frame here on
the<00:01:17.640> front<00:01:18.090> coil<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> machine

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the front coil here so the machine

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
the front coil here so the machine
operates<00:01:20.220> properly<00:01:20.490> I've<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.930> tiny

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
operates properly I've got a little tiny

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.460 
operates properly I've got a little tiny
shim<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.180> front<00:01:27.450> coil<00:01:27.810> sits<00:01:28.200> slightly

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
shim so the front coil sits slightly

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.730 
shim so the front coil sits slightly
higher<00:01:29.189> than<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.509> rear<00:01:30.869> coil

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:49.820 

and<00:01:37.250> then<00:01:40.000> get<00:01:41.000> those<00:01:41.210> tighten<00:01:41.750> down<00:01:41.780> here

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.980 

having<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:52.910> entirety<00:01:53.910> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> inside<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
having the entirety of the inside of the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.550

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
coil with no air space and it filled up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.860 
coil with no air space and it filled up
with<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> screw<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.400> also<00:02:02.760> important<00:02:03.390> having

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
with the screw is also important having

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.740 
with the screw is also important having
a<00:02:03.930> gap<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.440> inside<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.220> coils<00:02:05.940> makes

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
a gap on the inside of your coils makes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.430 
a gap on the inside of your coils makes
it<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.230> you<00:02:07.440> don't<00:02:07.650> get<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:09.020> strong<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.320> as

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
it so that you don't get as strong or as

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.520 
it so that you don't get as strong or as
clean<00:02:11.100> on<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.180> magnetic<00:02:12.690> field<00:02:15.470> on<00:02:16.470> your

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
clean on a magnetic field on your
