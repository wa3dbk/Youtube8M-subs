for example I like to adjust the way my

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.420 
for example I like to adjust the way my
mouse<00:00:28.880> speed<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:31.019> clicking<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.650> icons<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
mouse speed is so clicking on icons the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.569 
mouse speed is so clicking on icons the
reaction<00:00:32.969> time<00:00:33.620> when<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> hover<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> click<00:00:35.430> on

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
reaction time when I hover and click on

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
reaction time when I hover and click on
things<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> sensitivity<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.350> can

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
things the sensitivity all of that can

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.420 
things the sensitivity all of that can
be<00:00:37.649> done<00:00:37.829> easily<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:39.270> tweak<00:00:39.989> UI<00:00:40.230> ok<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
you don't have to go through different

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.150 
you don't have to go through different
utilities<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.360> programs<00:00:45.840> also<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> menu

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
speed maybe you want the popups of the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.139 
speed maybe you want the popups of the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that being able to adjust the reaction

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.910 
that being able to adjust the reaction
time<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.030> neat<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.770> just<00:00:58.770> go

what options you want displayed popping

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.160 
what options you want displayed popping
up<00:01:41.909> maybe<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.869> certain<00:01:43.049> things

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

that I liked as we're going down here
this<00:01:53.159> list<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.960> ability<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:57.270> adjust

this list was the ability to to adjust
the<00:01:57.750> login<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.310> that's<00:01:59.490> towards<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the login right so that's towards the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
the login right so that's towards the
bottom<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> adjust<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> drives<00:02:02.369> like

and
autoplay<00:02:08.729> options<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.080> your<00:02:10.229> USB

those<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.820> here<00:02:15.210> right<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.970> said

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
those in here right so but like I said

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.400 
those in here right so but like I said
those<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.690> those<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.230> pretty

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
those are those are pretty

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.480 
those are those are pretty
straightforward

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
straightforward

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.690 
straightforward
there<00:02:21.210> are<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.810> advanced<00:02:22.590> tweaks<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.460> here

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
there are more advanced tweaks in here

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.860 
there are more advanced tweaks in here
that<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.090> normally<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.570> go<00:02:24.750> in

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that you would normally have to go in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
that you would normally have to go in
through<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.140> registry<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.010> tweak<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
through the registry to do this tweak so

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.360 
through the registry to do this tweak so
that's<00:02:27.900> why<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:29.070> utility

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that's why I like this little utility

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.980 
that's why I like this little utility
right<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.000> saves<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> little<00:02:30.480> bit<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.780> time

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
right it saves you a little bit of time

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.030 
right it saves you a little bit of time
right<00:02:31.740> not<00:02:32.250> everything<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.940> done<00:02:33.120> easily

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
right not everything can be done easily

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.650 
right not everything can be done easily
and<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:35.250> everything<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.820> tweak<00:02:36.209> UI<00:02:36.420> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and not everything is in tweak UI of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.820 
and not everything is in tweak UI of
course<00:02:36.930> some<00:02:37.140> things<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> do

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
course some things you have to do

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.970 
course some things you have to do
outside<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.370> tweak<00:02:38.580> UI<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.739> got

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
outside of tweak UI but it's it's got

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
outside of tweak UI but it's it's got
quite<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.250> bit<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:42.120> can't<00:02:42.390> complain<00:02:42.690> this

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
quite a bit so we can't complain this

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
quite a bit so we can't complain this
free<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.560> from<00:02:43.739> Microsoft<00:02:44.250> so

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
free and it's from Microsoft so

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.300 
free and it's from Microsoft so
obviously<00:02:44.760> they've<00:02:44.970> tested<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.630> used<00:02:45.840> it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
obviously they've tested it and used it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
obviously they've tested it and used it
like<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.459> said<00:02:47.520> earlier<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.510> login<00:02:49.020> option<00:02:49.470> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590
