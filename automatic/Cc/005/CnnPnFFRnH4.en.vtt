useful for background music because when
that<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.489> ends<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.300> revert<00:00:57.600> back

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that one ends it will then revert back

will<00:01:00.359> play<00:01:00.570> forever<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.620> keep

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
will play forever it would just keep

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.959 
will play forever it would just keep
going<00:01:02.070> backwards<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> forwards<00:01:02.789> backwards

going backwards and forwards backwards
and<00:01:03.270> forwards<00:01:03.739> very<00:01:04.739> useful<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.159> background

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

an emergency you may have to deal with

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
an emergency you may have to deal with
so<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.360> let<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> know

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so you can put that on and let you know

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
so you can put that on and let you know
that<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> customers<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.560> getting<00:01:16.830> music

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that the customers are getting music

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
that the customers are getting music
they<00:01:18.240> won't<00:01:18.509> notice<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.799> gap<00:01:20.009> in

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
they won't notice because the gap in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
they won't notice because the gap in
between<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.850> changeover<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.570> about<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> same

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
between the changeover is about the same

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.120 
between the changeover is about the same
gappers<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.540> normal<00:01:24.840> CD<00:01:25.200> anyway

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gappers there is on a normal CD anyway

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
gappers there is on a normal CD anyway
I've<00:01:26.400> cute<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.470> under

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I've cute this one up about just under

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.069 
I've cute this one up about just under
15<00:01:29.040> seconds<00:01:29.549> before<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.000> end<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:31.020> see

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
15 seconds before the end is they see

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
15 seconds before the end is they see
the<00:01:31.290> last<00:01:31.500> couple<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.920> notes<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> track

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the last couple of notes of the track

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:51.820 
the last couple of notes of the track
and<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.259> happens

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.649 

so<00:01:52.830> as<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.420> same

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
so as you can see about the same

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
so as you can see about the same
distance<00:01:55.229> serviced<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> minute

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
distance serviced on that for a minute

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.029 
distance serviced on that for a minute
about<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> same<00:01:57.539> distance<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.049> time<00:01:58.289> that<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
about the same distance in time that you

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.649 
about the same distance in time that you
would<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.310> between<00:01:59.580> tracks<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> normal<00:02:00.420> CD

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
would get between tracks on a normal CD

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.679 
would get between tracks on a normal CD
the<00:02:01.530> first<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:01.950> finished<00:02:02.570> second<00:02:03.570> one

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the first one finished second one

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.440 
the first one finished second one
started<00:02:04.430> all<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.970> do<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.330> achieve
