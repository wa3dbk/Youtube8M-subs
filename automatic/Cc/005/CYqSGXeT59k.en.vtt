head<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:56.050> toy<00:00:56.500> design<00:00:56.890> let's<00:00:57.609> go<00:00:57.869> so<00:00:58.869> what<00:00:59.229> is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
head of toy design let's go so what is

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
head of toy design let's go so what is
the<00:00:59.589> senior<00:01:00.039> vice<00:01:00.309> president<00:01:00.909> of<00:01:01.119> design<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the senior vice president of design I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.279 
the senior vice president of design I
basically<00:01:03.760> head<00:01:03.940> up<00:01:04.059> all<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.509> creative<00:01:04.960> which

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
basically head up all the creative which

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.380 
basically head up all the creative which
means<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.130> inception<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.880> product<00:01:07.270> from

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
means the inception of the product from

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.420 
means the inception of the product from
the<00:01:07.539> ideation<00:01:07.869> of<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.200> product<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:09.340> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
the ideation of the product to the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.700 
the ideation of the product to the
development<00:01:09.909> let's<00:01:10.149> talk<00:01:10.299> about<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.810> Monsuno

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
development let's talk about the Monsuno

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.529 
development let's talk about the Monsuno
because<00:01:12.100> this<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.640> one<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.909> your<00:01:13.000> newer<00:01:13.270> toys

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
because this is one of your newer toys

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.419 
because this is one of your newer toys
right<00:01:13.810> yes<00:01:14.289> how<00:01:14.710> did<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:14.979> come<00:01:15.159> up<00:01:15.190> with<00:01:15.280> the

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
right yes how did you come up with the

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.850 
right yes how did you come up with the
idea<00:01:15.700> okay<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:16.360> this<00:01:16.539> idea<00:01:16.720> was<00:01:17.080> our<00:01:17.500> foray

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
idea okay so this idea was our foray

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.340 
idea okay so this idea was our foray
into<00:01:18.069> entertainment<00:01:18.789> driven<00:01:19.450> toy<00:01:19.720> sales<00:01:20.020> and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
into entertainment driven toy sales and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.230 
into entertainment driven toy sales and
it<00:01:20.649> was<00:01:20.770> inspired<00:01:21.159> from<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.429> battery<00:01:21.819> which<00:01:22.090> is

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
it was inspired from a battery which is

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.639 
it was inspired from a battery which is
really<00:01:22.479> interesting<00:01:22.600> one<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.319> inventors

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
really interesting one of the inventors

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.410 
really interesting one of the inventors
to<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.039> battery<00:01:24.399> and<00:01:24.549> they<00:01:24.610> spun<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.149> with<00:01:25.270> his

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
to the battery and they spun it with his

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.719 
to the battery and they spun it with his
foot<00:01:25.569> with<00:01:25.750> her<00:01:25.869> finger<00:01:26.170> okay<00:01:26.890> on<00:01:27.100> end<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.520> it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
foot with her finger okay on end and it

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.309 
foot with her finger okay on end and it
basically<00:01:28.000> gave<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.240> really<00:01:28.630> interesting<00:01:28.810> spin

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
basically gave a really interesting spin

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.440 
basically gave a really interesting spin
so<00:01:29.950> what<00:01:30.069> they<00:01:30.190> did<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.399> they<00:01:30.700> helped<00:01:30.970> develop

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
so what they did is they helped develop

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.719 
so what they did is they helped develop
a<00:01:31.600> toy<00:01:31.840> around<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.350> action<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.009> came<00:01:33.580> up

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
a toy around that action and came up

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.020 
a toy around that action and came up
with<00:01:33.759> Monsuno<00:01:34.830> Lisa<00:01:35.830> whatever<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.369> okay<00:01:36.880> we

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
with Monsuno Lisa whatever you okay we

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.090 
with Monsuno Lisa whatever you okay we
are<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.450> design<00:01:37.869> facility<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.709> Jack's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
are in the design facility of Jack's

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.699 
are in the design facility of Jack's
Pacific<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.270> we<00:01:40.420> have<00:01:40.600> industrial<00:01:41.140> designers

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
Pacific so we have industrial designers

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.919 
Pacific so we have industrial designers
graphic<00:01:42.190> designers<00:01:42.640> some<00:01:43.360> focus<00:01:43.720> on<00:01:43.810> the

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
graphic designers some focus on the

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.209 
graphic designers some focus on the
packaging<00:01:44.440> some<00:01:44.770> focus<00:01:45.069> on<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.280> 3d<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:48.070> what

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
packaging some focus on the 3d and what

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.099 
packaging some focus on the 3d and what
you<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:48.520> over<00:01:48.700> here<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:49.090> roughly<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.780> deep

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
you see over here is roughly the deep

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.080 
you see over here is roughly the deep
engineering<00:01:50.350> pilot<00:01:51.130> okay<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.579> this<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:51.969> an

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
engineering pilot okay so this is an

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.090 
engineering pilot okay so this is an
engineering<00:01:52.450> pilot<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.200> pre-production

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
engineering pilot of a pre-production

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.179 
engineering pilot of a pre-production
model<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:55.359> shows<00:01:55.659> production<00:01:56.140> when<00:01:56.740> all<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
model this shows production when all the

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.279 
model this shows production when all the
the<00:01:57.549> fine<00:01:57.939> tweaks<00:01:58.299> are<00:01:58.570> kind<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.840> figured<00:01:59.140> out

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
the fine tweaks are kind of figured out

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.929 
the fine tweaks are kind of figured out
and<00:01:59.679> they<00:01:59.740> get<00:01:59.859> to<00:01:59.979> thing<00:02:00.130> folding<00:02:00.520> correctly

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
and they get to thing folding correctly

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.029 
and they get to thing folding correctly
and<00:02:01.149> fitting<00:02:01.539> into<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.840> capsule<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.500> then

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
and fitting into the capsule and then

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.529 
and fitting into the capsule and then
here<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.460> final<00:02:03.880> pack<00:02:04.090> out<00:02:04.299> of<00:02:04.420> the

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
here is the final pack out of the

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.169 
here is the final pack out of the
product<00:02:04.929> so<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.530> someone's<00:02:06.070> idea<00:02:06.219> just

product so this is someone's idea just
an<00:02:07.359> idea<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:07.899> was<00:02:08.079> sketched<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.039> then

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
an idea that was sketched out and then

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.370 
an idea that was sketched out and then
now<00:02:09.940> look<00:02:10.239> at<00:02:10.329> this<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.989> final

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
now look at this we have the final

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.680 
now look at this we have the final
product<00:02:11.590> exactly<00:02:12.519> that's<00:02:12.609> a<00:02:12.790> prototype<00:02:13.239> so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
product exactly that's a prototype so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.039 
product exactly that's a prototype so
from<00:02:13.989> from<00:02:14.320> this<00:02:14.590> point<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.000> yes<00:02:16.420> what's

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
from from this point to this yes what's

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.610 
from from this point to this yes what's
the<00:02:17.170> time<00:02:17.470> frame<00:02:17.650> probably<00:02:18.430> anywhere<00:02:18.730> within

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the time frame probably anywhere within

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
the time frame probably anywhere within
six<00:02:20.620> months<00:02:20.859> two<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.609> four<00:02:21.850> months<00:02:22.060> from<00:02:22.480> start

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
six months two to four months from start

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.869 
six months two to four months from start
to<00:02:22.989> finish

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
to finish

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.640 
to finish
so<00:02:25.879> this<00:02:26.269> basically<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.900> our<00:02:27.050> soft<00:02:27.410> good

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
so this basically is our soft good

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.949 
so this basically is our soft good
design<00:02:28.129> studio<00:02:28.550> okay<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.599> comprised

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
design studio okay so this is comprised

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.250 
design studio okay so this is comprised
of<00:02:30.170> soft<00:02:30.890> good<00:02:31.069> designers<00:02:31.599> sample<00:02:32.599> makers<00:02:32.959> we

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
of soft good designers sample makers we

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.869 
of soft good designers sample makers we
have<00:02:33.379> seamstresses<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.340> work<00:02:34.489> on<00:02:34.610> all<00:02:34.730> our

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
have seamstresses they work on all our

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.640 
have seamstresses they work on all our
soft<00:02:35.180> goods<00:02:35.360> like<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.660> roleplay<00:02:35.900> dresses<00:02:36.470> that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
soft goods like a roleplay dresses that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.650 
soft goods like a roleplay dresses that
you<00:02:36.709> work<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:37.040> single<00:02:37.430> flush<00:02:37.849> yeah<00:02:38.330> some<00:02:38.599> of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you work on single flush yeah some of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.380 
you work on single flush yeah some of
the<00:02:38.720> dollar<00:02:38.959> fits<00:02:39.290> even<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> great

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
the dollar fits even so this is a great

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.180 
the dollar fits even so this is a great
example<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.900> how<00:02:41.959> Prada<00:02:42.560> comes<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.980> fruition

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
example of how Prada comes to fruition

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.920 
example of how Prada comes to fruition
this<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.790> called<00:02:44.030> an<00:02:44.150> orthographic<00:02:44.480> drawing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
this is called an orthographic drawing

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.589 
this is called an orthographic drawing
so<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:45.709> happens<00:02:46.010> here<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.430> she<00:02:47.090> does<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.390> top

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
so what happens here is she does the top

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.920 
so what happens here is she does the top
view<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.190> front<00:02:49.190> view<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.519> side<00:02:50.060> view<00:02:50.090> basically

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
view a front view a side view basically

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.720 
view a front view a side view basically
gives<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.349> Orient<00:02:51.769> then<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> Orient

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
gives it to the Orient then the Orient

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.820 
gives it to the Orient then the Orient
basically<00:02:53.120> replicates<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.930> produces<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> 3d

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
basically replicates and produces a 3d

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.990 
basically replicates and produces a 3d
model<00:02:55.129> which<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.340> see<00:02:55.519> over<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.910> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
model which you see over here on the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.770 
model which you see over here on the
right<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.160> 3d<00:02:58.640> media<00:02:59.150> versus

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
right and this is the 3d media versus

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.140 
right and this is the 3d media versus
the<00:02:59.930> old-school<00:03:00.430> marker<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.579> pencil<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150
