00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
States it's really important to be on a

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.370 
States it's really important to be on a
cdma<00:05:46.470> network<00:05:47.340> not<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.789> gsm<00:05:48.300> network<00:05:48.660> because

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
cdma network not a gsm network because

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.469 
cdma network not a gsm network because
you<00:05:49.470> can<00:05:49.590> pick<00:05:49.770> up<00:05:49.919> those<00:05:50.039> 4G<00:05:50.490> speeds<00:05:50.669> and<00:05:51.120> it's

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
you can pick up those 4G speeds and it's

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.150 
you can pick up those 4G speeds and it's
just<00:05:51.690> better<00:05:51.870> service<00:05:52.320> all<00:05:52.530> over<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.860> states

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
just better service all over the states

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.640

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
both so I think that that's a vantage

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.890 
both so I think that that's a vantage
that<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.200> has<00:05:58.350> also<00:05:59.000> so<00:06:00.000> yeah<00:06:00.150> this<00:06:00.450> has<00:06:00.630> been<00:06:00.840> a
