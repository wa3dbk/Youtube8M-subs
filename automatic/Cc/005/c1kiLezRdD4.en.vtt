eighties<00:00:50.200> several<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.740> came<00:00:50.950> out<00:00:51.130> with<00:00:51.340> what

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
eighties several it came out with what

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.760 
eighties several it came out with what
we<00:00:51.670> call<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.880> sundar<00:00:52.420> drive<00:00:52.660> shell<00:00:52.990> that<00:00:53.620> was

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
we call the sundar drive shell that was

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.520 
we call the sundar drive shell that was
non<00:00:54.010> hardened<00:00:54.580> steel<00:00:54.990> meaning<00:00:55.990> this<00:00:56.140> area

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
non hardened steel meaning this area

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.270 
non hardened steel meaning this area
right<00:00:56.800> in<00:00:56.860> here<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.910> not<00:00:58.210> hardened<00:00:59.070> so<00:01:00.070> there's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
right in here is not hardened so there's

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.730 
right in here is not hardened so there's
two<00:01:00.490> things<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:00.880> happens<00:01:01.450> to<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.500> first

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
two things that happens to it the first

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.260 
two things that happens to it the first
thing<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:03.310> is<00:01:03.580> inside<00:01:04.540> this<00:01:05.310> son<00:01:06.310> shell<00:01:06.700> are

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
thing is is inside this son shell are

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
thing is is inside this son shell are
supposed<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.780> be<00:01:07.960> splines<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.359> gear

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
supposed to be splines and this gear

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.190 
supposed to be splines and this gear
drives<00:01:12.490> inside<00:01:13.030> here<00:01:13.509> let's<00:01:14.320> fly<00:01:15.899> spline<00:01:16.899> out

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
drives inside here let's fly spline out

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.859 
drives inside here let's fly spline out
strip<00:01:17.799> themselves<00:01:18.429> out<00:01:18.579> you<00:01:19.390> get<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> no

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
strip themselves out you get a no

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.260 
strip themselves out you get a no
reverse<00:01:20.319> movement<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.759> one<00:01:22.060> of<00:01:22.179> the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
reverse movement that's one of the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.940 
reverse movement that's one of the
problems<00:01:22.719> with<00:01:22.899> not<00:01:23.079> having<00:01:23.409> a<00:01:23.590> hardened

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
problems with not having a hardened

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.999 
problems with not having a hardened
steel<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:25.030> second<00:01:25.539> one<00:01:25.689> is<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.200> they<00:01:26.770> just

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
steel the second one is is they just

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.940 
steel the second one is is they just
literally<00:01:27.670> break<00:01:28.060> up<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.590> see<00:01:29.799> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
literally break up you can see the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.969 
literally break up you can see the
sponge<00:01:30.310> ring<00:01:30.729> there<00:01:30.999> but<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.929> still<00:01:32.710> broke

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
sponge ring there but it still broke

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.969 
sponge ring there but it still broke
right<00:01:33.340> off<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:33.789> Sun<00:01:34.030> shell<00:01:34.469> now<00:01:35.469> for

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
right off the Sun shell now for

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.249 
right off the Sun shell now for
reversion<00:01:36.700> see<00:01:36.969> this<00:01:37.240> son<00:01:37.509> shell<00:01:37.810> splines

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
reversion see this son shell splines

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.770 
reversion see this son shell splines
into<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:38.799> drum<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.999> give<00:01:40.179> you<00:01:40.299> a<00:01:40.329> reverse

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
into the drum to give you a reverse

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.050 
into the drum to give you a reverse
condition<00:01:42.749> the<00:01:43.749> band<00:01:44.490> squeezes<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.700> drum

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
condition the band squeezes this drum

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.639 
condition the band squeezes this drum
for<00:01:46.509> second<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.229> fourth<00:01:47.799> gear<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.439> is

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
for second and fourth gear so this is

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.160 
for second and fourth gear so this is
bad<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.369> don't<00:01:52.090> spend<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:52.539> drought<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.109> you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
bad you don't spend the drought so you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.529 
bad you don't spend the drought so you
lose<00:01:53.409> second<00:01:53.889> and<00:01:54.009> fourth<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:55.090> also<00:01:55.240> lose

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
lose second and fourth and you also lose

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.830 
lose second and fourth and you also lose

ways to go

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.740 
ways to go
the<00:02:03.570> first<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> hardened<00:02:05.220> steel

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the first way is with a hardened steel
