00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
right well um I guess the biggest one

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.520 
right well um I guess the biggest one
would<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> new<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:48.200> it's<00:00:49.200> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
would be a new at a time it's it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.049 
would be a new at a time it's it's
almost<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.890> our<00:00:50.100> current<00:00:50.370> payroll<00:00:50.640> system

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
almost like our current payroll system

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.930 
almost like our current payroll system
is<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> time<00:00:51.899> vampire<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> takes

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
is like a time vampire it just it takes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.090 
is like a time vampire it just it takes
so<00:00:54.149> much<00:00:54.300> time<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> input<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.320> information<00:00:55.350> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100

in the process of trying to establish a
third<00:01:52.920> branch<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.909> we'll<00:01:54.509> hopefully<00:01:54.689> be

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
third branch so we'll hopefully be

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
third branch so we'll hopefully be
looking<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.409> maybe<00:01:55.619> 15<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> 20<00:01:56.520> employees

sounds like and so if I'm understanding

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.360 
sounds like and so if I'm understanding
correctly<00:04:34.640> um<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:36.620> know<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.070> main

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
correctly um you know the the main

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.300 
correctly um you know the the main
issues<00:04:37.790> aren't<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.390> time<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:40.070> know<00:04:40.190> the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
issues aren't the time and you know the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.100 
issues aren't the time and you know the
errors<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.970> manually<00:04:41.420> inputting

errors and the manually inputting
everything<00:04:42.590> like<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.830> right<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:44.600> if<00:04:45.050> we<00:04:45.380> had

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
everything like that right so if we had

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.320 
everything like that right so if we had
a<00:04:45.590> solution<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.610> was<00:04:46.700> customized

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
a solution that was customized

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.230 
a solution that was customized
specifically<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.410> guys<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:49.310> would

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
specifically to you guys that would

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.050 
specifically to you guys that would
limit<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.320> amount<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.800> data<00:04:52.280> entry<00:04:52.670> that<00:04:52.760> you

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
limit the amount of data entry that you

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.270 
limit the amount of data entry that you
have<00:04:53.180> to<00:04:53.330> put<00:04:53.510> in<00:04:53.660> right<00:04:53.960> as<00:04:54.170> well<00:04:54.560> as<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:55.130> know

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
have to put in right as well as you know

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
of these issues right I mean it's just

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.320 
of these issues right I mean it's just
it's<00:05:45.860> it's<00:05:46.160> things<00:05:46.400> like<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.760> where<00:05:47.030> you

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
it's it's things like that where you

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.120 
it's it's things like that where you
know<00:05:47.450> we<00:05:47.780> end<00:05:47.930> up<00:05:48.050> putting<00:05:48.230> in<00:05:48.500> incorrect

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
know we end up putting in incorrect

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.440 
know we end up putting in incorrect
information<00:05:49.490> or<00:05:49.820> you<00:05:49.910> don't<00:05:49.970> like<00:05:50.120> like<00:05:50.360> I

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
information or you don't like like I

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.850 
information or you don't like like I
mentioned<00:05:50.780> with<00:05:50.870> losing<00:05:51.290> checks<00:05:51.530> or<00:05:51.710> miss

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
mentioned with losing checks or miss

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.850 
mentioned with losing checks or miss
placing<00:05:52.190> checks<00:05:52.430> things<00:05:52.640> like<00:05:52.880> that<00:05:53.090> um<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
placing checks things like that um you

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.020 
placing checks things like that um you
know<00:05:54.890> I<00:05:54.980> think<00:05:55.100> things<00:05:55.400> like<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.640> could<00:05:56.000> be

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
know I think things like that could be

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.480 
know I think things like that could be
fixed<00:05:56.330> with<00:05:56.570> features<00:05:57.290> like<00:05:57.410> direct<00:05:58.040> deposit

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
fixed with features like direct deposit

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.510 
fixed with features like direct deposit
which<00:05:58.960> our<00:05:59.960> current<00:06:00.200> system<00:06:00.830> happens<00:06:01.130> to<00:06:01.430> be

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
which our current system happens to be

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.600 
which our current system happens to be
lacking<00:06:01.760> so<00:06:02.690> I<00:06:03.110> mean<00:06:03.470> if<00:06:03.590> we<00:06:03.740> add<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:03.890> feature

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
lacking so I mean if we add a feature

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.300 
lacking so I mean if we add a feature
like<00:06:04.880> that<00:06:05.060> and<00:06:05.300> that<00:06:05.390> would<00:06:05.450> allow<00:06:05.690> us<00:06:05.720> to

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
like that and that would allow us to

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.680 
like that and that would allow us to
make<00:06:07.310> sure<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:07.970> employees<00:06:08.330> are<00:06:08.360> getting

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
make sure that the employees are getting

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.960 
make sure that the employees are getting
their<00:06:09.050> proper<00:06:09.320> comments

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970

the data to try to fix the problem yeah
you<00:06:49.570> know<00:06:49.660> is<00:06:49.780> that<00:06:49.900> that's<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.440> time<00:06:50.620> that

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
could be better spent trying to forge my

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.840 
could be better spent trying to forge my
third<00:06:53.800> practice<00:06:54.250> you<00:06:54.400> know<00:06:54.490> and<00:06:54.640> get<00:06:54.730> that

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
third practice you know and get that

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.760 
third practice you know and get that
going<00:06:55.060> or<00:06:55.330> even<00:06:55.780> just<00:06:55.930> focus<00:06:56.230> on<00:06:56.320> the<00:06:56.380> patients

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
going or even just focus on the patients

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.330 
going or even just focus on the patients
even<00:06:56.890> so<00:06:57.420> it's<00:06:58.420> something<00:06:58.630> that's<00:06:58.930> you<00:06:59.140> know

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
even so it's something that's you know

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
even so it's something that's you know
seems<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.460> becoming<00:07:00.700> more<00:07:00.820> of<00:07:01.000> a<00:07:01.060> consistent

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
seems to becoming more of a consistent

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.050 
seems to becoming more of a consistent
issue<00:07:01.690> which<00:07:02.020> is<00:07:02.290> not<00:07:02.560> okay<00:07:03.070> definitely

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
issue which is not okay definitely
