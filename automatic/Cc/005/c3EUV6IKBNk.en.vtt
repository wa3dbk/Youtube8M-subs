00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
conflict in a book and some of them

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.200

might<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.259> addressed<00:02:04.799> logically<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.909> then

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
might be addressed logically and then

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
might be addressed logically and then
others<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.110> still<00:02:07.469> important<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.190> not

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
part of the story the authors like two

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
part of the story the authors like two
plus<00:02:13.110> two<00:02:13.170> equals

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
plus two equals

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490 
plus two equals
or<00:02:13.980> fantastic<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.050> whole<00:02:16.230> other

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
part of the story that is also important

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.630 
part of the story that is also important
they're<00:02:19.260> kind<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.709> seven<00:02:20.130> times<00:02:20.310> 5

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
they're kind of like seven times 5

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.880 
they're kind of like seven times 5
equals<00:02:21.000> negative<00:02:21.180> 50<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.560> how<00:02:22.590> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
equals negative 50 that's not how that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.660 
equals negative 50 that's not how that
works<00:02:23.660> no<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.740> often<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.040> lazy<00:02:26.459> writing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
works no this is often just lazy writing

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.210 
works no this is often just lazy writing
where<00:02:27.240> they<00:02:27.330> kind<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.959> get<00:02:28.319> themselves<00:02:28.800> into<00:02:29.100> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
where they kind of get themselves into a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.710 
where they kind of get themselves into a
hole<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:29.940> they're<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.300> kind<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.540> like

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
hole and then they're just kind of like

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.330 
hole and then they're just kind of like
I<00:02:30.840> don't<00:02:30.900> feel<00:02:31.260> like<00:02:31.440> digging<00:02:31.620> myself<00:02:31.920> out<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
I don't feel like digging myself out of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.370 
I don't feel like digging myself out of
it<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.760> I'm<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.120> gonna<00:02:33.300> decide<00:02:33.750> randomly

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
it so I'm just gonna decide randomly

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
it so I'm just gonna decide randomly
that<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.890> magical<00:02:35.459> powers<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.300> can

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that I have magical powers now and can

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.520 
that I have magical powers now and can
fly<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> didn't<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.310> before<00:02:39.530> what

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
fly when I didn't have that before what

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.910 
fly when I didn't have that before what
the<00:02:41.100> weird<00:02:41.370> metaphor<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.660> know<00:02:42.920> whatever

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the weird metaphor but you know whatever

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.540 
the weird metaphor but you know whatever
number<00:02:44.850> four<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.950> non-existent<00:02:46.950> conflict

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
number four is non-existent conflict

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.720 
number four is non-existent conflict
resolution<00:02:48.239> at<00:02:48.600> least<00:02:48.930> with<00:02:49.170> number<00:02:49.440> three

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
resolution at least with number three

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
resolution at least with number three
illogical<00:02:50.730> conflict<00:02:51.180> resolution<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:52.260> tried

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
illogical conflict resolution they tried

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.210 
illogical conflict resolution they tried
I<00:02:53.250> guess<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:54.600> with<00:02:54.989> number<00:02:55.410> four<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.010> just

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
I guess but with number four it's just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.070 
I guess but with number four it's just
kind<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.459> like<00:02:56.519> Oh<00:02:56.880> remember<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.630> thing<00:02:58.019> that

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
kind of like Oh remember that thing that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.530 
kind of like Oh remember that thing that
happened<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> need<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.280> resolve<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.970> don't

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
happened that I need to resolve I don't

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.840 
happened that I need to resolve I don't
feel<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.459> where<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> author

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
feel like it this is where the author

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.000 
feel like it this is where the author
gets<00:03:03.300> stuck<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.840> hole<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.620> decides<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
gets stuck in a hole and just decides to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.300 
gets stuck in a hole and just decides to
sit<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:06.560> not<00:03:07.560> do<00:03:07.709> anything<00:03:07.739> about<00:03:08.160> it

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
sit there and not do anything about it

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.370 
sit there and not do anything about it
it's<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.330> thing<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.570> have<00:03:09.720> certain<00:03:10.140> things

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
it's one thing to have certain things

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.170 
it's one thing to have certain things
open-ended<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.459> an<00:03:11.610> ending<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:13.910> some<00:03:14.910> things

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
open-ended in an ending but some things

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.150 
open-ended in an ending but some things
need<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.660> resolved<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.800> know<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.130> mean

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
need to be resolved you know what I mean

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.090 
need to be resolved you know what I mean
and<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> tricky<00:03:18.570> one<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.040> how<00:03:20.040> do

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
and this is a tricky one because how do

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.860 
and this is a tricky one because how do
you<00:03:20.310> tell<00:03:20.579> what<00:03:20.790> has<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.269> resolved<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you tell what has to be resolved and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
you tell what has to be resolved and
what<00:03:22.019> doesn't<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.950> sometimes<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.459> read<00:03:23.610> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
what doesn't but sometimes you read a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.970 
what doesn't but sometimes you read a
book<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.180> go<00:03:24.329> how<00:03:24.650> how<00:03:25.650> did<00:03:25.860> they

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
book and you just go how how did they

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.620 
book and you just go how how did they
think<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.280> was<00:03:26.400> appropriate<00:03:26.489> not<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.299> resolve

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
think it was appropriate not to resolve

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.480 
think it was appropriate not to resolve
this<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.459> yeah<00:03:29.459> just

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.370 

if<00:03:35.490> you're<00:03:35.700> gonna<00:03:35.880> take<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.420> energy<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.110> make

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380

if you're gonna take the energy to make
conflict<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.340> your<00:03:38.550> book<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:39.030> need<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.660> take

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
conflict in your book you need to take

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.960 
conflict in your book you need to take
the<00:03:40.110> energy<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.850> resolve<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:43.460> set<00:03:44.460> too<00:03:44.610> much<00:03:44.640> to

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
the energy to resolve it set too much to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.990 
the energy to resolve it set too much to
ask<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.620> number<00:03:46.620> five<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.250> over

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
ask for number five is the over

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
ask for number five is the over
exaggerated<00:03:48.630> villain<00:03:48.990> who<00:03:49.320> actually<00:03:49.710> isn't

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
exaggerated villain who actually isn't

that<00:03:50.400> hard<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.790> beat<00:03:51.000> which<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.750> mentioned<00:03:51.810> in

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
that hard to beat which I mentioned in

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
that hard to beat which I mentioned in
my<00:03:52.320> bookish<00:03:52.710> pet<00:03:52.920> peeves<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:53.940> is

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
my bookish pet peeves and this is

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.030 
my bookish pet peeves and this is
basically<00:03:54.300> where<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.380> spend<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.740> whole<00:03:55.830> book

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
basically where you spend the whole book

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.820 
basically where you spend the whole book
hyping<00:03:56.460> up<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.060> antagonist<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.870> then<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
hyping up the antagonist and then at the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.890 
hyping up the antagonist and then at the
