00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.450
 the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.270
 Welcome to the fan tv that I am 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.650
 There is nothing wrong with spades today 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.180
 to do that with me by hand 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.710
 dig this field behind me 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.570
 but today it's about the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.210
 integrated tire pressure regulating system of 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.919
 sandy who wario cribs like you with 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.720
 vario grip can save money and 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.880
 at the same time the field already that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.840
 Find out here today and the sport 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 is still playing a role today 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.980
 So far, the air pressure was the factor 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.949
 a compromise between field and street 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.350
 The first offers completely in the steering 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.170
 vehicle concept integrated tire pressure 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.030
 regulation by mario frick can the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.610
 driver already during the ride 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.399
 Air pressure control without much loss of time 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 and effort and thereby quite comfortably over 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.440
 the barrio terminal adjustable 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.430
 the advantages of optimal tire pressure 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.320
 are commonly known but now has 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.180
 a team of university sauce the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.630
 effects of white air pressure 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.830
 driveway slip traction and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.430
 fuel consumption scientifically 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.320
 studied next to me is professor 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.840
 people from the university soest at the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 I save this success why 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.930
 is the saving in agriculture 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.130
 blur 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.830
 I can get a picture with the spade 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.619
 do as it looks in the ground and in the 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.470
 ground, the yield grows into the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.899
 roots and soil is at the same time 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.280
 the roadway for the machine and me 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.039
 can see if I'm all right 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.000
 that means I can do it in the 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.039
 see ground 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.560
 I managed that I can 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.319
 see how are the roots distributed i 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.750
 can see how much viability is 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.970
 but how many traces have been made 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.569
 and if I get everything right 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.909
 I have a high yield at the same time 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.890
 reasonable effort the floor is like 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.349
 a book and you can see how the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.030
 next management measures 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:10.060
 to look and basis everyone 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.220
 Food production is the soil and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.959
 That's why I keep the spade in 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.959
 training for students for one 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.670
 central tool convenient tool 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.280
 is requirement for good 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.390
 agriculture we have ideals 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.040
 conditions here 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.560
 We measured a week and 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.780
 We can test the tractor completely 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.050
 shining through while he works that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.000
 So diesel means a train performance 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 and then we can say now is the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.989
 efficiency is good now 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.110
 Tractor's power to the ground and 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.120
 so I'm doing good work 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.490
 to get accurate readings 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.590
 Antonius smiths in particular 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.920
 new evaluation program as well 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.530
 ingenious metrology we have one 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.870
 GPS sensor built around the real one 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.060
 to determine the priority of the tractor then 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.520
 we have the wheel rotations of the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.160
 Tractor measured around the speed 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.890
 to determine the tractor and then have 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.360
 we built diesel flowmeter around 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.390
 the input power of the tractor too 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.490
 determine and further we have traction 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.950
 the tractor measured in the three we 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.680
 Traction knife installed on the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.510
 then three points of the implement 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.069
 the efficiency of the machine too 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.379
 to get 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.810
 while driving the streets and in the 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.060
 field use with a group were all 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.049
 parameter at three different tires 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.249
 press measured 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.249
 once with 0 8 bar then with 1 3 bar and 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:41.019
 At the end of 18 was already on the 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.969
 first glance becomes clear the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.700
 soil compaction recognizable by the 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.799
 Tire track is significantly different 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.670
 initial results confirm the 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.670
 visual impression 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.590
 We collected a lot of data 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.160
 we are still focused on evaluating 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.830
 become 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.680
 but the first overview shows that we 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.900
 At high pressure, high pressure roads 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.850
 markers work that much more 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.830
 need diesel and much less 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.120
 how do we get the performance? 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.400
 Lower tire pressure 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.280
 by less slip I have more 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.900
 real speed that is the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.859
 Tractor moves faster on the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.440
 ground ahead 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.630
 I have a higher surface performance that 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.200
 means less tractor operating hours 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.370
 on the field and thus clear 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.470
 Cost reduction is the benefit 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.139
 at least five euros per hour 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.030
 the through an integrated tire pressure 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.729
 control system together with the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.450
 skilled user 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.919
 he will have convinced me the earth 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.840
 plant that it has a manufacturer as 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.840
 fendt went ahead and said 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.310
 the thing is tire pressure or customized 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.450
 maturing on the field is important to us 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.160
 do not realize that 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.750
 retrofit solutions but integrate 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.490
 a solution in the tractor so that the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.350
 driver comfortably out of the cabin 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.780
 The rice flight can do with our 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.460
 can adjust and thus the diesel 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.089
 consumption lowers and the naughty performance 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.189
 elevated 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:11.559
 that with air more precisely with air pressure 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:14.409
 can also save money and at the same time 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.839
 the ground already sounds simple but the 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.159
 Development of a fully integrated 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.990
 tire pressure control system for tractors 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.509
 is one hand on the one hand 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.029
 Engineer performance on the other hand also 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.759
 smart technology with a future 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.460
 the human being can not make a ground for the 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.749
 to preserve the ground here in 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.089
 tens of thousands of years ago 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:36.399
 It's our job with the next generation 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:38.169
 and for the next 100 and 1000 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:39.879
 generations the machines like that 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.680
 to use that you have no ground 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.370
 Doing the damage is the vision for 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.740
 the future 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.539
 and i need a machine for that 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.279
 can adapt to the ground and 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.649
 that is why the development with the 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:54.389
 variable tire pressure just the right one 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.389
 technology that suits the time 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.000
 so that 's it from the tire pressure 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.650
 control system and the start 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.090
 next time you will see something about that 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.580
 most beautiful camp what is there for men 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.580
 namely that horst baur kempis
