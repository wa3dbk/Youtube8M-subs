realized that there was a specific

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.480 
realized that there was a specific
period<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.539> Soviet<00:01:08.049> history<00:01:08.439> that<00:01:09.189> hadn't

Soviet architectural history and at the
start<00:01:15.880> i<00:01:16.060> just<00:01:16.300> noticed<00:01:16.720> very<00:01:16.840> very<00:01:17.409> very

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
strange surprising buildings because i

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.529 
strange surprising buildings because i
had<00:01:23.830> seen<00:01:24.069> some<00:01:24.250> buildings<00:01:24.580> in<00:01:24.700> georgia<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.299> i

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
had seen some buildings in georgia and i

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.059 
had seen some buildings in georgia and i
remember<00:01:25.990> some<00:01:26.140> other<00:01:26.229> buildings<00:01:26.679> that<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.830> had

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
remember some other buildings that I had

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.010 
remember some other buildings that I had
seen<00:01:27.310> anywhere<00:01:27.819> I<00:01:28.179> connected<00:01:28.690> them<00:01:28.840> together

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
seen anywhere I connected them together

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.710 
seen anywhere I connected them together
and<00:01:29.619> then<00:01:30.069> just<00:01:30.880> thought<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.330> maybe<00:01:31.479> they

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
and then just thought that maybe they

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.840 
and then just thought that maybe they
would<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:32.140> could<00:01:32.590> find<00:01:32.830> more<00:01:33.039> if<00:01:33.220> I<00:01:33.369> went<00:01:33.670> on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
would I could find more if I went on

would I could find more if I went on
looking<00:01:34.360> for<00:01:34.720> them

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080
