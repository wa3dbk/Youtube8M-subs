knife will work and you just simply go
in<00:00:12.420> behind<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:14.580> climate<00:00:14.969> control<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:17.460> you're

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
in behind the climate control and you're

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.560 
in behind the climate control and you're
going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> remove<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.330> first<00:00:20.359> go<00:00:21.359> ahead<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
going to remove that first go ahead and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.630 
going to remove that first go ahead and
get<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> harnesses<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.439> your<00:00:22.529> way<00:00:22.650> okay

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.680 

then<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.789> need<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:30.060> ten<00:00:30.240> millimeter<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
then you need your ten millimeter and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
then you need your ten millimeter and
we'll<00:00:33.690> take<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> look<00:00:34.050> underneath<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
we'll take a look underneath here and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.990 
we'll take a look underneath here and
you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.329> four<00:00:36.899> bolts

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
you can see that there are four bolts

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.350 
you can see that there are four bolts
there's<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:40.370> one<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.270> I'm

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
there's one one right here and I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
there's one one right here and I'm
connected<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.739> other<00:00:43.860> ones<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.190> here

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
connected to the other ones right here

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760 
connected to the other ones right here
and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> other<00:00:45.690> two<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.379> deep

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and then the other two are in these deep

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.490 
and then the other two are in these deep
sockets<00:00:47.329> right<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.079> when<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> remove

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
sockets right here so when I remove

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
sockets right here so when I remove
those<00:00:49.649> bolts<00:00:49.969> there's<00:00:50.969> four<00:01:20.270> okay<00:01:21.270> once<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
those bolts there's four okay once you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
those bolts there's four okay once you
get<00:01:21.750> those<00:01:21.900> bolts<00:01:22.320> removed<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:23.369> entire

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
get those bolts removed this entire

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
get those bolts removed this entire
radio<00:01:24.030> assembly<00:01:25.549> simply<00:01:26.549> pulls<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:28.140> want

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
radio assembly simply pulls out you want

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.100 
radio assembly simply pulls out you want
to<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.470> behind<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.900> bit<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
to get behind it you can a little bit of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
to get behind it you can a little bit of
pressure<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:31.890> hesitate<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.579> pretty

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
pressure on don't hesitate it's pretty

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.510 
pressure on don't hesitate it's pretty
strong<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.290> pulls<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.400> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
strong and it pulls right out as you can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.170 
strong and it pulls right out as you can
see<00:01:37.009> okay<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> backside<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> the

two bottom ones the white and the black
our<00:02:09.590> video<00:02:10.590> ground<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.550> camera

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
our video ground and camera

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.560 
our video ground and camera
ground<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.740> our<00:02:12.860> bridge<00:02:13.100> together<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> in

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
ground and the our bridge together so in

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.640 
ground and the our bridge together so in
the<00:02:14.630> event<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.050> need<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> add<00:02:15.410> those

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the event that you need to add those

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650 
the event that you need to add those
pins<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.460> have<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> kit<00:02:16.940> for<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.150> as<00:02:17.360> well

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
pins we have a kit for that as well

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.260 
pins we have a kit for that as well
so<00:02:18.350> these<00:02:18.500> will<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.700> plugs<00:02:19.940> right<00:02:20.030> in

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
so these will this just plugs right in

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.720 
so these will this just plugs right in
as<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.830> mentioned<00:02:22.130> this<00:02:22.190> vehicle<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.610> already

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
as I mentioned this vehicle is already

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.840 
as I mentioned this vehicle is already
pre-wired<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.890> step<00:02:25.130> was<00:02:25.310> not<00:02:25.490> really

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
pre-wired so this step was not really

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.400 
pre-wired so this step was not really
necessary<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:26.540> us<00:02:26.630> since<00:02:26.810> our<00:02:26.900> camera<00:02:27.260> work

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
necessary for us since our camera work

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.610 
necessary for us since our camera work
the<00:02:28.340> first<00:02:28.580> time<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:30.170> put<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.410> all<00:02:30.470> back

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the first time to put it all back

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.510 
the first time to put it all back
together<00:02:31.570> simply<00:02:32.570> slides<00:02:32.870> back<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.680> then

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
together simply slides back in and then

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.800
