00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:13.419
 The sad man you passed by with me. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.320
 sympathy but when you saw my eyes 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.120
 unemployed 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.619
 wondered silently why they wander 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.769
 by the streets 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.080
 maybe that's why he rushed the pace and still 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.550
 that I wanted to called the word 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.130
 fainted in the mouth 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.630
 it is possible that you suppose that I 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.119
 I gave up work 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.149
 nevertheless it still knocks on the door today. 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.950
 door in vain 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.050
 many said they were over the age 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 to gain bread as if the nature of the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.260
 body was condemnation to uselessness 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.300
 others not knowing that I sold my 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.300
 better clothes to relieve the wife 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 Ill be fired hurriedly believing 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.510
 that I was a hobo without a profession 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.850
 I do not know if you noticed when the guard 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.789
 he yanked from the front of the shop window shouting 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.649
 hard words like I was a 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.530
 vulgar evildoer 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.920
 But believe me or pass me by. 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.450
 the idea of robbery only admired the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.610
 the exposed plans 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.690
 reminding the little ones to hug me with 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.600
 hungry when you return home 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.390
 maybe you've seen the people who 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.300
 jokes were imagining that I 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.330
 I was a drunk because I feared supported 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.000
 to the pole they all left with the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.070
 manifested contempt but did not have the courage 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.900
 to explain that he did not take any 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.120
 power three days to you yet 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.780
 who looked at me without fear 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.910
 I dare steal support and cooperation thank 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.990
 donate to me on behalf of the 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.290
 Christ that we say love and ask for 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.610
 restore hope so that I can 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.640
 honor with 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.460
 the gift of living 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.310
 for that you just need to approach me 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.580
 no disgust to let me know though 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.730
 all my misfortune that I'm still yours 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.730
 brother 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.220
 this is the message of a sad man who 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.430
 are like so many that we see wandering 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.590
 the streets it is true that some are 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.970
 in fact people who take pleasure in 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.209
 idleness 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.340
 but to the unfortunate that despite 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.470
 They could not work together for a lifetime. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.530
 for their own livelihoods and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.020
 family and that maturity is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 condemned by society to live as 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.370
 reprobate though they are worthy people 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.620
 it is common to observe men and women 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.020
 pulling a paper cart and other 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.610
 recyclable objects to provide the 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.040
 own sustenance 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.650
 are our evolutionary walking brothers 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.030
 who does not have the courage to live in indy 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.850
 This is why I work with dignity. 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.799
 many of us however we talked 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.470
 with these creatures that hinder the 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.680
 transit with your unwanted carts 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.170
 What we do not realize is that in addition to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.930
 cart has yet to load 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.330
 on the shoulders the weight of humiliation and 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.910
 of contempt imposed by a society 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.430
 indifferent 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.160
 It's true that we are all reaping 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.950
 what we plant and that those who pass 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.660
 these situations need these 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.570
 experiences to grow 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.360
 spiritually 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.390
 however our brothers are children of the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.810
 same creative father and deserving 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.440
 minimum of our respect 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.200
 if we can not help them that dare not 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.410
 we work playing say bitter words 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.819
 nor do we need them hindering them 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.819
 plus your walk 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.250
 Did you know that many people today 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.239
 living in misery were already very 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.519
 rich in other stocks and vice versa 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.819
 the divine laws to all 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.680
 lessons we need to make progress 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.199
 and logic says that he who is rich and 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 he lavishes his fortune on futilities and 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.290
 own benefit 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.199
 needs to go through needs 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.680
 materials to learn to value the 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.580
 treasures that God lends you in order to 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.580
 that can progress
