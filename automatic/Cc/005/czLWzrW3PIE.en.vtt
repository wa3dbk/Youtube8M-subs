00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello everyone today we will weave here 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 This bracelet is called a fishtail 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 or someone else as I call wheat 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.340
 I think it is called little wheat because 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 that he has such 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.670
 pigtails like callas plump glasses 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.119
 weaves very quickly you can weave 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.620
 on which here forks even on fingers 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.649
 but we will weave on the machine 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.440
 so take rezinochku first and dress her 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:48.469
 eight dress at once three rezinochki 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.469
 so 2 is dressed just alternating colors 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 another third gum dress another 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.270
 colors can of course someone like it and 1 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 ton do and now we lower 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.479
 rezinochki to the middle of remove descend 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 take the next one down a little 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:21.920
 rezinochku dress and also lower 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.369
 rezinochki to the middle 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.369
 remove all this 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.630
 this way of weaving we will have to 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.630
 finish to size you want 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.299
 will get a very tight pigtail 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.420
 I already have something like that 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.420
 looms out 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.990
 you see already the pigtail turns out so I 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.780
 I will weave to the end until he is 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.780
 i'm just on my wrist like 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.230
 so I dobled 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.420
 my bracelet now I will finish 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.730
 I want to show you again how to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:42.250
 do this way 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:46.720
 we dress one more elastic and also 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.720
 remove the bottom 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.860
 second rezinochki remove and the remaining 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.860
 rezinochku throw to another column 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.890
 So 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.410
 a little bit you can delay and put on our 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.410
 hooks 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.630

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.519
 find here our first rezinochki for 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.090
 which we will need to hook our 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.090
 hooks 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.740
 pull a little bit and pass the hook 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.500
 something is better now anyway 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.180

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.260
