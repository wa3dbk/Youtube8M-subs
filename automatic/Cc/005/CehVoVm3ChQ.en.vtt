here<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:06.010> need<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.250> go<00:02:06.370> in<00:02:06.550> first<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:08.519> at

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
here that need to go in first so at

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.959 
here that need to go in first so at
about<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.789> 45<00:02:10.479> degree<00:02:10.509> angle<00:02:10.980> we<00:02:11.980> put<00:02:12.219> that<00:02:12.519> side

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
about a 45 degree angle we put that side

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.750 
about a 45 degree angle we put that side
in<00:02:13.180> first<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.280> lay<00:02:15.579> down<00:02:15.609> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
in first then we can lay down the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.190 
in first then we can lay down the
rest<00:02:16.879> of<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:21.069> press<00:02:22.069> here<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.030> tabs<00:02:23.329> and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
rest of it press here on the tabs and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.589 
rest of it press here on the tabs and
you<00:02:24.319> should<00:02:24.590> feel<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.069> snapping<00:02:25.610> into<00:02:25.730> place

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:41.040 

now<00:02:29.599> our<00:02:29.720> survivor<00:02:30.079> is<00:02:30.290> ready<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:30.709> used
