 it's perfect here 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.790
 is the title brahmos be true 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.030
 which is also the machine she is receiving address 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.080
 of this English server to receive 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.350
 the stamp of laughter 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.120
 via agassi and pete 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.920
 with here 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.270
 so until then 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.179
 if I want to, for example, erase it

 automatically does it 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.310
 they were 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.689
 only the configuration 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:15.809
 bp from the bag that is not accepted v4 dates were in the ipv4 configuration here 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.070
 it will not be in the dome 7 v6 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.000
 because at the time quite fearful with static flowering 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.630
 is simply ending in the dynamic configuration whether I'm 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.590
 getting must go up to cpi 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.829
 on my english server 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.340
 and if you received have doubts how to create a server deny cpi 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.489
 really person

 and you really will 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.429
 learn how to create a dhcp server on your machine here 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:52.760
 it already seems that automatically the ipv6 address here and mother of 74 some 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.590
 What the sex is missing is 110 people 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.469
 and had 4 committee here 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.590
 and how could I really be able to 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.429
 in case 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.679
 I got a new address, or I chose this address 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.309

 and automatically it will fetch on this my English server 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.879
 through my collection of hcp 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.259
 a new address 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.389
 even if he has already tried to return here to grant Portuguese be moscow 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.019
 ex automatically placed with 9 2 points and 8 points 0 points 7 40 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.669
 other than the English server 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.229
 were shows that one thing I do not know is the chem management of 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.689
 servers is easier 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.809
 makino woods 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.769
 it should be noted 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.840
 a king milk 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.979
 and had 4 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.300
 and in our body 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.159
 the here 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.139
 we have some here 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.809
 and the captivating address was 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:52.569
 a bird 2 point and eight points 0 points 7 40 between 9 2 points to 8 points 0 bridge 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.369
 150 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.209
 it's perfect 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.879
 to avoid acquiring a Portuguese lighter and is acquiring 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.199
 first epa of the concession 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.000
 OK 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.870
 if I wanted to increase I could change the blame for what he lived for and really 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.669
 created new body here 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.169
 I could create a new disk modify has been extremely positive 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.410
 the legacy sink hypnosis 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.570
 aliane the free form rate that anyone who wants to learn what is a very thing 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.420
 simple very basic here 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.320
 can not change is automatically 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.450
 It happens that to confirm and neighbor of coffee that sweep thousand 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.120
 he would really get 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.790
 another ip address grant what is getting 140 why why is it 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.880
 my first address of the people that goes from 140 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.340
 one hundred and fifty here 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.080
 so it's perfect there and if I had, for example, show you a 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.800
 Portuguese servant 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.590
 helton really know his address at cpi 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.170
 if I had static address 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.969
 Let's see with the santino employee who starts 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.279
 so networked way 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.550
 property 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.419
 network connections impute local property rights or could 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:58.980
 also 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.199
 have gone so in the commands in growth to you to the short time here 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.559
 then one and pcp saucers are 4 and I'll activate it human king 2 point in eight 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:09.580
 points 0 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.710
 16 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.400
 can put the middle standard can also vote on the server 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.180
 Preferential dms with few coupon were a break that rock 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.199
 paqui 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.199
 He lives in the mind a little bit 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.279
 and it's perfect 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.439
 and already finalized and back goes through the requests client corrections 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.229
 a tip team with son 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.819
 there was not really changed something that was here in the name of asphalt 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.460
 very little 0 points and can all inter with the son o charité the cherry tomato 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.120
 changed to 9 2 points and to 8 points 0 point 16 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.910
 the address cadente register cuca came that test to have confidante 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.819
 eliezer 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.819
 force you guys that in fact he will not be able to release 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.900
 the one that I got old tactical clue so if it's static, it's already stuck 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.129
 on the machine so I can not not mind point for it to confirm 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:03.699
 plínio 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:04.879
 it costs you 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.910
 same thing 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.110
 if you can not 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.050
 However 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.819
 if I really go back in the local collection property holders 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:14.689
 and activate 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.590
 to that death obtain an ip address 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.389
 and an automatic king bed dns server 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.689
 what again 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.150
 quite wait a little bit more 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.330
 and there you have it 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.349
 they have automatically placed 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.330
 we go here again 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.789
 we trust you will see that 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.430
 automatically has already defined our ip address 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.080
 humala two points gave eight points 0 bridge 140 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.479
 let me again it's bordered on you 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:42.569
 that is 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.550
 automatically trying to win a new grant 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.380
 either with ipea confirms restart 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.240
 he is now back to sit down and have succeeded 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.110
 again 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.889
 this is very important this command of pep with filipa kings barrel 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.870
 because you often end up catching the 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.410
 everything in a form in a summary to explain to you 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.800
 it works to increase the correction of you 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.789
 have to like it and give the correction of the server kuiper check bar and thousand 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.389
 ivanise 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:09.760
 really is 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.820
 is the command is the most used psp command already at 0 or is already 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.309
 asked me pv 4 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.740
 and the poet and confirm 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.870
 darren 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.130
 I will again gain on ipv4 address through my disinterest of hcp 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.940
 I'm falling on the address 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.180
 and pdv to cpi 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.720
 was the first concession starts at 140 that perfect and already won a 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.539
 numbering 141 here 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.430
 together of course with the subnet mask and and mainly as iptv 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.219
 pattern 

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:39.579
 which is a 9 2 points and 8 point zero compute the tomato the risk of crime in the 

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:40.710
 dhcp server 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.850
 on the note to our English machine he already distributes 

00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:49.629
 all these interests as much as it had 4 as in taste and know 

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.300
 that the standard 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.470
 but with the next class
