00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
weighted so these tables where we can

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.589 
weighted so these tables where we can
see<00:00:18.590> date<00:00:18.770> people<00:00:19.160> are<00:00:19.580> bolted<00:00:20.029> all<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.450> way

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
on it it's just a pole way and so it

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.570 
on it it's just a pole way and so it
won't<00:01:10.360> support<00:01:11.360> weight<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:12.080> anybody<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.680> hang

bounces<00:02:17.209> off<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> everything<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:19.580> little

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
bounces off of everything and a little

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.630 
bounces off of everything and a little
bit<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.120> sound<00:02:20.390> goes<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> really<00:02:21.500> long<00:02:21.650> way<00:02:21.860> and

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
bit of sound goes a really long way and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.100 
bit of sound goes a really long way and
what<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:22.880> found<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.360> new<00:02:23.510> unit<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.049> that

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
what we found on the new unit is that

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.830 
what we found on the new unit is that
same<00:02:24.860> amount<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.250> sound<00:02:25.450> doesn't<00:02:26.450> really<00:02:26.630> go

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
same amount of sound doesn't really go

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.720 
same amount of sound doesn't really go
very<00:02:27.110> far<00:02:27.410> it's<00:02:27.920> absorbed<00:02:28.459> by<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
very far it's absorbed by the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.580 
very far it's absorbed by the
furnishings<00:02:29.299> it's<00:02:29.540> absorbed<00:02:30.019> by<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.230> tile

and the floor and it doesn't reflect

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.670 
and the floor and it doesn't reflect
back<00:02:32.390> at<00:02:32.569> you<00:02:32.690> quite<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.019> much<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:33.440> much
