00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
add this all at the same time so it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359

then<00:00:38.520> I've<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.790> three<00:00:38.820> cups<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.780> milk<00:00:41.270> if<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
then I've got three cups of milk if you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
then I've got three cups of milk if you
want<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.469> creamier<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.160> could<00:00:44.370> add

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
want it to be creamier you could add

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540 
want it to be creamier you could add
whole<00:00:44.789> milk<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.500> using<00:00:46.649> 1%<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
whole milk but I'm just using 1% and I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.100 
whole milk but I'm just using 1% and I
got<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> new<00:00:47.910> fridge<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.870> too

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
got a new fridge and that's a little too

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.060 
got a new fridge and that's a little too
cold<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.610> my<00:00:50.610> milks<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.149> slushy<00:00:51.390> already

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
cold so my milks a little slushy already

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
cold so my milks a little slushy already
so<00:00:53.070> we'll<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.640> add<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.300> it'll<00:00:54.570> all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so we'll just add it all and it'll all

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.920 
so we'll just add it all and it'll all
blend<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.190> I've<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.489> three

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
blend up and then I've got three

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.099 
blend up and then I've got three
tablespoons<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.140> sugar<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> it<00:01:00.109> so

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
tablespoons of sugar and that is it so

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
tablespoons of sugar and that is it so
you'll<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.399> put<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> lid<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.879> blender

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you'll just put the lid on your blender

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.859 
you'll just put the lid on your blender
and<00:01:03.449> blend<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> couple<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> minutes

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.630 

so<00:01:12.869> after<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> notice<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> ice

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so after you notice that all of the ice

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
so after you notice that all of the ice
cubes<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.180> been<00:01:15.299> blended<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.229> are

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
cubes have been blended then you are

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
cubes have been blended then you are
done<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:20.009> makes<00:01:20.369> quite<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> few<00:01:21.330> servings

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
done so this makes quite a few servings
you<00:01:22.170> could<00:01:22.380> easily<00:01:22.619> half<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.060> you're

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
