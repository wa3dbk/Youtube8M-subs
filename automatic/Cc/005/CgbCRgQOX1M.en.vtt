this this model uses the bird base at
the<00:01:11.340> beginning<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> refresher<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the beginning and as a refresher how you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
the beginning and as a refresher how you
do<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.549> create<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.330> base<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.869> first<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
do that create that base is first to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.539 
do that create that base is first to
take<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.070> piece<00:01:17.310> fold<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.570> half<00:01:19.100> in<00:01:20.100> both

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
take your piece fold it in half in both

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.190 
take your piece fold it in half in both
directions<00:01:21.350> horizontally<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.439> vertically

directions horizontally and vertically

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
directions horizontally and vertically
then<00:01:25.200> open<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> flip<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> page<00:01:27.060> around

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
then open it up and flip the page around

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
then open it up and flip the page around
you're<00:01:27.630> folding<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.290> half<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> white

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you're folding it in half with the white

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.280 
you're folding it in half with the white
side<00:01:29.520> facing<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.750> flip<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> around

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
side facing you and you flip it around

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.370 
side facing you and you flip it around
and<00:01:31.890> fold<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.759> over<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.650> diagonal<00:01:36.380> from

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and fold it over on the diagonal from

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.340 
and fold it over on the diagonal from
the<00:01:37.530> colored<00:01:37.920> side<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> open

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the colored side and then when you open

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.039 
the colored side and then when you open
that<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.820> way<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.570> start<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that all the way up it will start to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.880 
that all the way up it will start to
fold<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.950> along<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.490> diagonal<00:01:44.880> fold<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
fold in along that diagonal fold and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
fold in along that diagonal fold and
collapse<00:01:46.890> down<00:01:47.189> into<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.640> smaller<00:01:48.000> square<00:01:50.960> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
collapse down into a smaller square so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.819 
collapse down into a smaller square so
that<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.290> piece<00:01:52.619> looks<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
that your piece looks like this

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.370 
that your piece looks like this
now<00:01:55.829> once<00:01:56.070> you've<00:01:56.250> created<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.149> square<00:01:57.659> your

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now once you've created the square your

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.420 
now once you've created the square your
next<00:01:58.950> step<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.759> create<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.600> bird<00:02:00.990> base<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
next step to create this bird base is to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.310 
next step to create this bird base is to
then<00:02:03.409> take<00:02:04.409> your<00:02:04.619> piece<00:02:04.890> fold<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.869> fold<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
then take your piece fold it fold the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320 
then take your piece fold it fold the
top<00:02:07.560> flap<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> give<00:02:08.849> yourself<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
top flap over just to give yourself a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.270 
top flap over just to give yourself a
good<00:02:09.509> idea<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.229> where<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.679> center

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
good idea of where the center

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.250 
good idea of where the center
line<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.840> fold<00:02:13.380> each<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:14.790> these<00:02:15.720> side

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
line is and then fold each of these side

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
line is and then fold each of these side
points<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.700> center<00:02:18.709> create<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.740> really

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
points to the center create a really

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.930 
points to the center create a really
good<00:02:20.550> crease<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.569> side<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.550> fold<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.730> top

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
good crease on the side and fold the top

created by folding into the center and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.300 
created by folding into the center and
you<00:02:50.730> get<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.140> look<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.440> baby<00:02:52.680> birds<00:02:53.010> now

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you get that look of a baby birds now

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.000

that<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> talked<00:02:54.209> about<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.480> lot<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.019> then<00:02:55.860> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that I talked about a lot and then it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.880 
that I talked about a lot and then it
will<00:02:56.130> fold<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.209> way<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.410> down<00:02:58.650> on

all<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> create<00:03:20.640> some

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
all of this is just to create some

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.319 
all of this is just to create some
really<00:03:21.269> good<00:03:21.420> creases<00:03:22.790> open<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.880> back<00:03:24.000> up

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
really good creases open it back up

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.850 
really good creases open it back up
and<00:03:24.540> then<00:03:25.320> lift<00:03:25.590> up<00:03:27.380> allowing<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> pieced

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and then lift up allowing the pieced

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.280 
and then lift up allowing the pieced
Bend<00:03:29.660> fold<00:03:30.660> along<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.910> line<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.630> then

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
Bend fold along this this line and then

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.009 
Bend fold along this this line and then
pushing<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> edges<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.209> sides<00:03:36.540> so

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
pushing in on the edges on the sides so

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.920 
pushing in on the edges on the sides so
then<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.590> folds<00:03:37.799> down<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.579> itself<00:03:38.940> along<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
then it folds down on itself along the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.180 
then it folds down on itself along the
other<00:03:40.970> folds<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.810> when<00:03:42.989> you're<00:03:43.140> done<00:03:43.320> with<00:03:44.160> all

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
other folds so when you're done with all

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.470 
other folds so when you're done with all
of<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.630> your<00:03:45.840> bird<00:03:46.049> base<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:47.480> it

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
of that this is your bird base and it

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.599 
of that this is your bird base and it
will<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.870> split<00:03:49.380> you'll<00:03:50.070> see<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.400> sort<00:03:50.549> of

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
will be split you'll see it's sort of

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.060 
will be split you'll see it's sort of
split<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.329> end<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.840> then<00:03:52.380> there's<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
split on one end and then there's the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.690 
split on one end and then there's the
double<00:03:53.780> sort<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.840> flaps<00:03:55.170> up<00:03:55.410> here<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.940> top

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
double sort of flaps up here on the top

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.910 
double sort of flaps up here on the top
now<00:03:59.700> from<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.329> position<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.989> your<00:04:01.049> bird<00:04:01.650> base

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
now from the position of your bird base

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.940 
now from the position of your bird base
with<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.519> split<00:04:02.970> part<00:04:03.269> impart<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.560> bottom

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
with the split part impart to the bottom

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.030 
with the split part impart to the bottom
fold<00:04:06.410> out<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.799> across<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.640> two<00:04:09.470> split

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.090 

parts<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.870> out<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.799> across<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.729> and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
parts so out and across like this and

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.300 
parts so out and across like this and
then<00:04:19.100> fold<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.729> whole<00:04:19.970> piece<00:04:21.310> over<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:25.070> this

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
then fold the whole piece over like this

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.060 
then fold the whole piece over like this
and<00:04:26.710> then<00:04:27.710> rotate<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:30.380> longer

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
and then rotate it so that the longer

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.860 
and then rotate it so that the longer
part<00:04:31.510> is<00:04:32.510> horizontal<00:04:35.410> now<00:04:36.410> you're<00:04:37.010> going<00:04:37.340> to

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
part is horizontal now you're going to

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.770 
part is horizontal now you're going to
do<00:04:38.870> an<00:04:39.110> outside<00:04:39.770> reverse<00:04:40.340> fold<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:41.210> this

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
do an outside reverse fold on this

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.070 
do an outside reverse fold on this
longer<00:04:42.229> piece<00:04:42.830> here<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.800> want<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:47.080> angle

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
longer piece here and you want the angle

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.710 
longer piece here and you want the angle
to<00:04:48.979> begin<00:04:49.970> right<00:04:50.600> down<00:04:51.490> here<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:53.110> continue

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
to begin right down here and continue

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.689 
to begin right down here and continue
right<00:04:56.720> across<00:04:57.050> here<00:04:59.470> so<00:05:00.470> fold<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.370> first<00:05:03.699> back

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
right across here so fold it first back

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.520 
right across here so fold it first back
and<00:05:04.729> forth<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.419> can<00:05:05.479> see<00:05:05.810> it's<00:05:06.020> it's<00:05:06.320> just

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
and forth and you can see it's it's just

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.909 
and forth and you can see it's it's just
continuing<00:05:07.070> straight<00:05:07.550> up<00:05:07.760> from<00:05:08.449> this<00:05:08.919> this

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
continuing straight up from this this

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.610 
continuing straight up from this this
intersection<00:05:10.550> here<00:05:11.030> fold<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.990> back<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:12.320> forth

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
intersection here fold it back and forth

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.740 
intersection here fold it back and forth
first<00:05:13.160> because<00:05:13.610> it's<00:05:13.760> a<00:05:13.820> little<00:05:13.940> bit<00:05:14.120> thick<00:05:14.419> at

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
first because it's a little bit thick at

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.640 
first because it's a little bit thick at
this<00:05:14.930> point<00:05:15.289> and<00:05:15.590> then<00:05:16.750> flip<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.900> entire<00:05:18.020> bit

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
this point and then flip the entire bit

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.560 
this point and then flip the entire bit
up<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.010> over<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.699> may<00:05:22.820> not<00:05:23.000> even<00:05:23.180> have<00:05:23.300> to

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
up and over and you may not even have to

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.420 
up and over and you may not even have to
open<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:24.080> up<00:05:24.139> a<00:05:24.320> little<00:05:24.500> bit<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.830> get<00:05:24.979> it<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.160> do

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
open it up a little bit to get it to do

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:39.340 
open it up a little bit to get it to do
that<00:05:26.650> back<00:05:27.650> up<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:31.780> over

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.570 

like<00:05:39.950> that<00:05:41.470> now<00:05:42.470> this<00:05:42.680> next<00:05:42.890> little<00:05:43.250> bit<00:05:43.400> is

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
like that now this next little bit is

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.100 
like that now this next little bit is
actually<00:05:43.760> a<00:05:44.030> little<00:05:44.270> difficult<00:05:44.690> for<00:05:44.870> me<00:05:44.960> to

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
actually a little difficult for me to

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.800 
actually a little difficult for me to
show<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.620> with<00:05:46.550> this<00:05:46.730> particular<00:05:47.060> paper<00:05:47.600> I

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
show you with this particular paper I

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.570 
show you with this particular paper I
think<00:05:47.990> it's<00:05:48.260> a<00:05:48.350> little<00:05:48.470> hard<00:05:48.800> for<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.160> to<00:05:49.280> see

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
think it's a little hard for you to see

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.300 
think it's a little hard for you to see
but<00:05:50.330> after<00:05:51.020> you've<00:05:51.200> done<00:05:51.500> that<00:05:51.710> outside

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
but after you've done that outside

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.220 
but after you've done that outside
reverse-fold<00:05:53.050> hold<00:05:54.050> it<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:54.530> that<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:55.010> is<00:05:55.340> is

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
reverse-fold hold it so that that is is

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.140 
reverse-fold hold it so that that is is
facing<00:05:57.230> if<00:05:57.710> you're<00:05:57.950> looking<00:05:58.610> at<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:58.940> it's

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
facing if you're looking at it it's

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.120 
facing if you're looking at it it's
facing<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.900> left<00:06:00.140> and<00:06:02.290> then<00:06:03.290> this<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.950> what

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
facing the left and then this is what

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.520 
facing the left and then this is what
you're<00:06:04.280> doing<00:06:04.670> you're<00:06:05.210> pulling<00:06:05.780> down<00:06:06.080> on<00:06:06.440> the

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
you're doing you're pulling down on the

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.340 
you're doing you're pulling down on the
one<00:06:07.190> side<00:06:07.520> that's<00:06:07.790> facing<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.570> of<00:06:08.810> this<00:06:09.110> bit

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350
