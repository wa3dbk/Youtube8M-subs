then<00:05:21.670> fish<00:05:21.970> parallel<00:05:22.600> to<00:05:23.080> keep<00:05:23.260> your<00:05:23.440> offering

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
then fish parallel to keep your offering

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.190 
then fish parallel to keep your offering
in<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.280> most<00:05:24.490> productive<00:05:24.700> zones<00:05:25.330> especially

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
in the most productive zones especially

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.570 
in the most productive zones especially
when<00:05:26.380> you're<00:05:26.530> along<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:26.920> shorelines

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
when you're along the shorelines

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.210 
when you're along the shorelines
like<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.390> said<00:05:28.450> when<00:05:28.930> split<00:05:29.230> shot<00:05:29.530> it's<00:05:29.890> always

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
like I said when split shot it's always

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.460 
like I said when split shot it's always
best<00:05:30.640> to<00:05:30.850> try<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.180> parallel<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:32.020> shoreline

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
best to try and parallel the shoreline

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.790 
best to try and parallel the shoreline
or<00:05:32.740> area<00:05:33.460> you're<00:05:33.790> fishing<00:05:34.270> but<00:05:34.780> when<00:05:35.680> you're

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
or area you're fishing but when you're

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.790 
or area you're fishing but when you're
casting<00:05:36.070> from<00:05:36.520> deep<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:37.000> shallow<00:05:37.470> always<00:05:38.470> slow

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
casting from deep to shallow always slow

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.460 
casting from deep to shallow always slow
your<00:05:39.010> presentation<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.000> when<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.600> say<00:05:40.840> slow<00:05:41.200> I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
your presentation and when I say slow I

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.510 
your presentation and when I say slow I
mean<00:05:42.250> slow<00:05:42.610> simply<00:05:43.570> because<00:05:43.950> you'll<00:05:44.950> move<00:05:45.280> the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
mean slow simply because you'll move the

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.850 
mean slow simply because you'll move the
lure<00:05:45.730> through<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.270> strike<00:05:46.540> zone<00:05:46.600> too<00:05:47.350> quickly

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
lure through the strike zone too quickly

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.130 
lure through the strike zone too quickly
always<00:05:48.490> look<00:05:48.730> for<00:05:48.970> high<00:05:49.150> percentage<00:05:49.690> areas

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
always look for high percentage areas

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.250 
always look for high percentage areas
like<00:05:50.650> points<00:05:51.220> at<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.790> mouth<00:05:52.000> of<00:05:52.180> coves<00:05:52.450> deep

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
like points at the mouth of coves deep

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.340 
like points at the mouth of coves deep
wide<00:05:53.620> gap<00:05:53.950> pockets<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.870> secondary<00:05:55.870> banks

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
wide gap pockets and secondary banks
