00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:43.180
 Logitech is well advised and needs to

 a mechanical keyboard thanks to keys 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.049
 still a softer and softer 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.209
 relatively quiet stop plus one 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.459
 quite extensive equipment both

 mechanical keyboard yes or no that 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.639
 plays the subjective feeling yet 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.639
 a pretty big role
