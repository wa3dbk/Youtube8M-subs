00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 good afternoon dear friends today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.010
 tell you how to remove 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.630
 programs from autoload many 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.500
 probably faced such a problem 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.410
 that the computer either hangs on startup 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 either it takes a long time to turn it 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 due to the fact that when you install programs 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.019
 the function is clogged in them by default 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.560
 they run with windows 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 so in most but many programs 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.930
 no need at all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.210
 the queue makes them useless for 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 installing them into autoload so we 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.480
 we will clean them with you today and so 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 how do we do this push start 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.590
 perform 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:57.400
 and prescribe here m s so m with config 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:02.710
 click ok and go here we have 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.720
 such a tab as autoload here 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.560
 Here are all these programs for me 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.619
 defaults stood at system startup what 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.280
 turn very strong and loaded then 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.320
 there is by removing the checkmarks from certain 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.510
 programs you can turn them on 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.060
 autoload and turn off that 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.700
 radically change your download time 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.780
 but let 's say that's all removed click 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.020
 apply ok let's say there are programs 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.250
 which are just not being unloaded from here 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 this team here 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.970
 what you need to do you can go to the panel 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.860
 control panel start and so 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.440
 administration here from the zucchini 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.509
 given service and here by default 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.840
 score and services as windows and all 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.630
 some programs are installed 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.600
 installed on your computer 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 do they write here do they have 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.899
 the service let's say it works like that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.899
 let's say kaspersky on yauze I won't find 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.530
 she works here and if 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.849
 is in such a state you are from here and 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.739
 and when the tick dies, she can 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.599
 do not assume that it will be all the same 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.909
 load 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:37.329
 let's say if we find that service 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:40.150
 which interests us here let’s let her 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:44.819
 just let's turn it off and press 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.819
 stop click yes 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.370
 I fundamentals will pass the application of this service 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.800
 one of my programs which 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.810
 installed so i can show you 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.430
 this as an example and not afraid for 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.870
 that something can happen 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.970
 click apply and ok all this 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.260
 the program will no longer be 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.510
 work and turn 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.540
 if we would have her here in 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.150
 autoload wouldn’t clean up now 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.880
 she cleaned and all we would have would work 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.820
 excellent after restarting the computer 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:24.510
 changes will take effect here in principle 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.510
 Thank you all for your attention.
