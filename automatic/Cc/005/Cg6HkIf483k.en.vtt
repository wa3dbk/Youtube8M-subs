bail so what we're gonna do is put that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.750 
bail so what we're gonna do is put that
aside<00:01:56.390> until<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:59.810> need<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.430> now<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.460> prepare

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
aside until we need it now to prepare

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.359 
aside until we need it now to prepare
the<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.320> what<00:02:03.320> we're<00:02:03.439> going<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.799> do<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.100> make<00:02:04.340> a

the can what we're going to do is make a

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.600 
the can what we're going to do is make a
series<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.880> holes<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.189> what<00:02:07.189> I<00:02:07.220> want<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.549> to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
series of holes and what I want you to

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.670 
series of holes and what I want you to
imagine<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.690> cross<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.729> camp<00:02:11.000> an<00:02:11.290> X<00:02:12.290> I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.350 
imagine is a cross in the camp an X I
use<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.450> seam<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.190> measure<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.090> can

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
use the seam as a measure so that I can

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.630 
use the seam as a measure so that I can
get<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.690> cross<00:02:17.959> where<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.320> want<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.739> what<00:02:19.519> I'm

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
get that cross where I want it what I'm

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.990 
get that cross where I want it what I'm
going<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.880> do<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.180> begin<00:02:20.390> by<00:02:20.810> putting<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:22.000> series

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
going to do is begin by putting a series

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.170 
going to do is begin by putting a series
of<00:02:23.030> holes<00:02:23.920> around<00:02:24.920> half<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.640> cam<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
of holes around half of the cam on the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.960 
of holes around half of the cam on the
bottom<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.140> where<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> tin<00:02:28.489> still<00:02:28.820> is

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
bottom of the can where the tin still is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.630 
bottom of the can where the tin still is
and<00:02:29.239> I'm<00:02:29.959> just<00:02:29.989> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.650> put<00:02:30.860> one

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
and I'm just going to put one

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.450 
and I'm just going to put one
right<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.660> middle<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.020> my<00:02:34.200> ex<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.980> then

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
right in the middle of my ex and then

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.150 
right in the middle of my ex and then
I'm<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.820> put<00:02:39.090> two<00:02:39.540> off<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.380> side

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.340 

then<00:02:44.160> I'll<00:02:44.310> put<00:02:44.520> two<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.030> other<00:02:45.120> side<00:02:45.480> what

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
then I'll put two on the other side what

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.030 
then I'll put two on the other side what
these<00:02:46.590> are<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.070> ear<00:02:47.400> holes<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> air<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
these are is ear holes for the air to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.320 
these are is ear holes for the air to
come<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.820> use<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.150> it's

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
come in we're going to use this it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.450 
come in we're going to use this it's
gonna<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.540> very<00:02:51.750> similar<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.920> convection

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
gonna be very similar to a convection

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.300 
gonna be very similar to a convection
chimney<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.570> air<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.870> gonna<00:02:55.050> come<00:02:55.380> in<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
chimney the air is gonna come in the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.370 
chimney the air is gonna come in the
heat<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.670> gonna<00:02:56.910> rise<00:02:57.210> up<00:02:57.570> pulling<00:02:57.990> more<00:02:58.200> air

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
heat is gonna rise up pulling more air

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.500 
heat is gonna rise up pulling more air
in<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.800> we'll<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.400> able<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.730> turn<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.390> now

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
in and we'll be able to turn this so now

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.690 
in and we'll be able to turn this so now
we've<00:03:00.690> got<00:03:00.930> five<00:03:01.230> holes<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.340> bottom<00:03:02.610> of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
we've got five holes in the bottom of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.690 
we've got five holes in the bottom of
the<00:03:02.760> camp<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.320> opposite<00:03:04.860> side<00:03:05.160> from<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the camp on the opposite side from the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.210 
the camp on the opposite side from the
center<00:03:06.090> hole<00:03:06.330> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> opposite<00:03:07.920> side<00:03:08.190> from

center hole on the opposite side from

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.060 
center hole on the opposite side from
the<00:03:08.520> center<00:03:08.820> hole<00:03:09.000> we're<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.410> cut<00:03:10.650> out<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
the center hole we're going to cut out a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.480 
the center hole we're going to cut out a
V<00:03:11.760> now<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.540> V<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.230> about

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
V now this V is going to be about

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.980 
V now this V is going to be about
two-and-a-half<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.910> three<00:03:15.150> inches<00:03:15.420> wide<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
two-and-a-half to three inches wide and

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.400 
two-and-a-half to three inches wide and
it's<00:03:16.620> going<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.010> go<00:03:17.160> about<00:03:17.490> 1/3<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.600> 1/2<00:03:18.870> down

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
it's going to go about 1/3 to 1/2 down

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.440 
it's going to go about 1/3 to 1/2 down
the<00:03:19.620> camp<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:20.580> order<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.820> make<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.240> little

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the camp in order to make this a little

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.690 
the camp in order to make this a little
easier<00:03:21.690> I'm<00:03:22.320> gonna<00:03:22.560> actually<00:03:22.770> put<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.520> on

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
easier I'm gonna actually put the can on

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.470 
easier I'm gonna actually put the can on
this<00:03:23.820> log

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
this log

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720 
this log
now<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.770> going<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.010> be<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> triangle

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
now this can is going to be a triangle

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.390 
now this can is going to be a triangle
with<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> point<00:03:27.680> down<00:03:28.680> here<00:03:28.709> at<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.100> bottom

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
with the point down here at the bottom

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.090 
with the point down here at the bottom
and<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.690> right<00:03:31.020> in<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.230> center<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
and this is right in the center on the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.550 
and this is right in the center on the
opposite<00:03:32.490> side<00:03:32.820> I'm<00:03:33.750> going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> put<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.350> hole

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
opposite side I'm going to put that hole

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.940 
opposite side I'm going to put that hole
there<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.840> I'm<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.080> gonna<00:03:37.230> start<00:03:37.650> taking

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
there and I'm just gonna start taking

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.930 
there and I'm just gonna start taking
out<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:39.030> metal<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.550> will<00:03:41.730> take<00:03:41.910> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
out the metal and this will take a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.900 
out the metal and this will take a
minute<00:03:42.180> or<00:03:42.420> two<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.400> when<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.700> done<00:03:44.880> with

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
minute or two so when I get done with

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:53.670 
minute or two so when I get done with
this<00:03:45.180> I'll<00:03:45.390> be<00:03:45.450> right<00:03:45.690> back

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.199

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
all right now I've made to cut the whole

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.880 
all right now I've made to cut the whole
way<00:03:56.330> around<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:57.050> I'm<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.200> gonna<00:03:57.470> pull<00:03:57.799> out

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
way around and I'm just gonna pull out

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.699 
way around and I'm just gonna pull out
this<00:03:58.129> little<00:03:58.310> triangle<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.840> you<00:04:00.170> can<00:04:00.409> see

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
this little triangle so that you can see

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.820 
this little triangle so that you can see
what<00:04:01.310> we've<00:04:01.489> got<00:04:01.700> left

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
what we've got left

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.570 
what we've got left
baikinman<00:04:03.830> gets<00:04:04.459> off<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:04.819> big<00:04:05.090> old<00:04:05.269> stump

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
baikinman gets off this big old stump

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.600 
baikinman gets off this big old stump
all<00:04:07.580> right<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:09.049> now<00:04:09.260> we've<00:04:09.470> got<00:04:09.709> five<00:04:10.040> holes<00:04:10.370> in

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
all right so now we've got five holes in

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.820 
all right so now we've got five holes in
the<00:04:10.700> bottom<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.180> can<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.599> on<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.620> back

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
the bottom of the can and on the back

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.910 
the bottom of the can and on the back
side<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:13.640> have<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.879> triangle<00:04:14.629> again<00:04:15.500> it's<00:04:15.680> about

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
side we have a triangle again it's about

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.460 
side we have a triangle again it's about
two<00:04:16.370> inches<00:04:16.699> wide<00:04:16.970> by<00:04:17.570> about<00:04:17.810> two<00:04:18.079> and<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.290> half

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
two inches wide by about two and a half

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.830 
two inches wide by about two and a half
three<00:04:18.769> inches<00:04:19.190> long<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.729> can<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.750> I've

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
three inches long you can see that I've

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.140 
three inches long you can see that I've
left<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.320> little<00:04:21.500> bit<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.010> can<00:04:22.280> on<00:04:22.520> top<00:04:22.550> and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
left a little bit of the can on top and

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.180 
left a little bit of the can on top and
that<00:04:23.180> will<00:04:23.780> give<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:23.930> some<00:04:24.050> more<00:04:24.410> stability

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
that will give it some more stability

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.020 
that will give it some more stability
now<00:04:25.850> basically<00:04:26.750> our<00:04:27.229> Hobo<00:04:27.560> stove<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:28.070> done<00:04:28.340> but

we're gonna flip it over 9 180 degrees
and<00:05:24.349> we're<00:05:24.620> going<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.919> put<00:05:25.130> another<00:05:25.310> hole

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
and we're going to put another hole

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.050 
and we're going to put another hole
right<00:05:25.729> on<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.000> other<00:05:26.030> side<00:05:26.240> these<00:05:27.229> holes<00:05:28.060> are

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
right on the other side these holes are

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.680 
right on the other side these holes are
to<00:05:29.240> hold<00:05:29.360> our<00:05:29.539> bail<00:05:29.750> now<00:05:31.240> make<00:05:32.240> those<00:05:32.479> a<00:05:32.510> little

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
to hold our bail now make those a little

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.129 
to hold our bail now make those a little
bit<00:05:32.810> bigger<00:05:34.210> again<00:05:35.210> it<00:05:35.389> makes<00:05:35.539> it<00:05:35.780> easy<00:05:35.900> if

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
bit bigger again it makes it easy if

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.510 
bit bigger again it makes it easy if
you're<00:05:36.229> doing<00:05:36.440> this<00:05:36.620> on<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.860> piece<00:05:37.130> of<00:05:37.160> wood

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
you're doing this on a piece of wood

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.750 
you're doing this on a piece of wood
that<00:05:37.789> way<00:05:38.660> you<00:05:39.380> don't<00:05:39.560> have<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:39.950> can<00:05:40.190> warping

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
that way you don't have the can warping

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.860 
that way you don't have the can warping
on<00:05:40.910> you<00:05:41.120> or<00:05:41.270> causing<00:05:41.690> any<00:05:41.750> problem<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:43.870> open

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
on you or causing any problem and open

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.279 
on you or causing any problem and open
that<00:05:44.990> up<00:05:45.400> now<00:05:46.400> we<00:05:46.460> can<00:05:46.760> take<00:05:46.970> our<00:05:47.180> bail<00:05:47.419> which

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
that up now we can take our bail which

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.520 
that up now we can take our bail which
we<00:05:48.500> had<00:05:48.650> earlier<00:05:48.680> our<00:05:49.490> coat<00:05:49.729> hanger<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.530> we

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
we had earlier our coat hanger and we

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.400 
we had earlier our coat hanger and we
can<00:05:51.710> put<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.130> into<00:05:54.190> this<00:05:55.190> hole<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:56.410> then

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
can put that into this hole and then

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.500 
can put that into this hole and then
just<00:05:57.680> close<00:05:57.949> it<00:05:58.220> up

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
just close it up

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.890 
just close it up
they're<00:06:00.140> the<00:06:00.230> same<00:06:00.440> thing<00:06:00.740> on<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:00.980> other<00:06:01.010> side

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
they're the same thing on the other side

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.930 
they're the same thing on the other side
put<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:02.990> in<00:06:03.110> there<00:06:04.510> get<00:06:05.510> it<00:06:05.630> straight<00:06:05.960> here<00:06:06.940> and

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
put it in there get it straight here and

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.170 
put it in there get it straight here and
close<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.570> up<00:06:08.600> now<00:06:09.560> we<00:06:09.620> basically<00:06:10.280> have<00:06:10.670> the

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
close that up now we basically have the

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.090 
close that up now we basically have the
Hoboken<00:06:11.540> set<00:06:12.080> up<00:06:12.200> and<00:06:12.380> this<00:06:12.440> Bale<00:06:12.710> is<00:06:12.920> gonna

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
Hoboken set up and this Bale is gonna

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.540 
Hoboken set up and this Bale is gonna
make<00:06:13.340> this<00:06:13.640> a<00:06:13.910> lot<00:06:14.480> easier<00:06:14.510> to<00:06:15.080> use<00:06:15.370> one<00:06:16.370> of<00:06:16.460> the

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
make this a lot easier to use one of the

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.490 
make this a lot easier to use one of the
reasons<00:06:16.910> is<00:06:17.060> because<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.540> can<00:06:17.750> now<00:06:17.870> carry<00:06:18.200> this

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
reasons is because I can now carry this

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.860 
reasons is because I can now carry this
with<00:06:18.770> me<00:06:18.980> in<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.190> woods<00:06:19.370> and<00:06:19.880> what<00:06:20.630> that's

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
with me in the woods and what that's

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.050 
with me in the woods and what that's
gonna<00:06:21.080> do<00:06:21.320> is<00:06:21.470> allow<00:06:21.590> me<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:22.040> transport<00:06:22.490> fire
