effect now since we don't have a year to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.080 
effect now since we don't have a year to
spend<00:00:16.980> learning<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> technique<00:00:17.850> from<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
spend learning the technique from the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.760 
spend learning the technique from the
odd<00:00:18.210> radians<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> inside

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
odd radians how about we do it inside

odd radians how about we do it inside
After<00:00:20.130> Effects<00:00:20.400> there's<00:00:21.090> two<00:00:21.270> different<00:00:21.539> ways

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
After Effects there's two different ways

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
After Effects there's two different ways
to<00:00:21.689> accomplish<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.320> effect<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:23.250> both

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
to accomplish this effect and they both

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
to accomplish this effect and they both
end<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> same<00:00:24.180> result<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.960> can

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
end up with the same result you can

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.480 
end up with the same result you can
either<00:00:25.230> shoot<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> actor<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> green<00:00:26.250> screen

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
either shoot the actor on a green screen

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.490 
either shoot the actor on a green screen
and<00:00:26.730> comp<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> background<00:00:27.570> later<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.349> you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and comp in the background later or you

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
and comp in the background later or you
can<00:00:28.650> shoot<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.920> location<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.910> only

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
can shoot on location the only

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.060 
can shoot on location the only
difference<00:00:30.539> being<00:00:30.750> shooting<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.410> location<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
difference being shooting on location is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.040 
difference being shooting on location is
a<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.399> more<00:00:32.520> time-consuming<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.750> both

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
a little more time-consuming in both

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
a little more time-consuming in both
circumstances<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:35.040> need<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> shoot<00:00:35.460> your

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
circumstances you need to shoot your

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
circumstances you need to shoot your
actor<00:00:35.850> performing<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> transmission<00:00:37.020> action

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
actor performing the transmission action

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
actor performing the transmission action
and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:37.950> you'll<00:00:38.070> need<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> clean<00:00:38.579> play<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and then you'll need a clean play if you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.790 
and then you'll need a clean play if you
want<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.840> active<00:00:40.140> reappearing<00:00:40.710> in

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
want to have your active reappearing in

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
want to have your active reappearing in
different<00:00:41.129> areas<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> shot<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.329> them

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
different areas of the shot have them

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
different areas of the shot have them
repeat<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> action<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> few<00:00:43.260> times<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> just

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
repeat the action a few times and just

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.590 
repeat the action a few times and just
make<00:00:44.160> sure<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.520> clean<00:00:44.789> plate<00:00:45.030> runs<00:00:45.329> long

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
make sure your clean plate runs long

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.940 
make sure your clean plate runs long
enough<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.930> cover<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> shot<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.739> you're

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
enough to cover the shot if you're

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410 
enough to cover the shot if you're
shooting<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.309> green<00:00:47.520> screen<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.180> nuts

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
shooting on green screen just go nuts

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.610

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.560 
timeline as well if you play through it
it<00:01:08.430> shouldn't<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.210> crappy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570

it shouldn't look like a very crappy
effect<00:01:09.990> even<00:01:10.500> more<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.250> add<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
effect even more so if you add this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.429 
effect even more so if you add this
sound<00:01:11.820> effects<00:01:12.119> now<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.780> basic<00:01:13.140> edits<00:01:13.380> done
