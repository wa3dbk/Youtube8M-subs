00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.250
 particular and not being here but 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.000
 being outside 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 thank God it was given and the truth 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.800
 always be able to belong to such a team 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.020
 great as this is something magnificent luis 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.610

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.280

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.570
 miguel layÃºn and osvaldo this round like this 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.670
 that you're going to eat well when there's no 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.470
 a better one here in training with 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.370
 Miguel in training and with the other 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.890
 I take it out of the tool side 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.470
 We are not going well, we have left for rumba 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.200
 also and you have to accept it in the rhythm 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.600
 of good rumba and we keep going out 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.460
 much to eat more than anything diego armando 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.480
 he felt for his passage in europe good 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:46.080
 or the dream I had as a child of 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.460
 I can fulfill it and well the truth is 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.900
 I was with a thorn of power 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.440
 stay much longer but but 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.570
 well that's the way of God 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.640
 and let's hope he has a new 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.520
 opportunity today the difference of football 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.560
 Colombian to Spanish football and soccer 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.170
 mexican what of the things that more or 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.510
 least you can differentiate good suddenly 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.400
 soccer does not suddenly football 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.210
 Colombian has always been characterized 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.970
 for having a lot of the ball for being very 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.950
 paused for always to secure the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.410
 ball go well from behind 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.010
 and good at very fast players very 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.490
 strong that will balance a lot the 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.800
 Mexican soccer is 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.740
 everyone thinks it's easy to play 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.590
 right here the truth is pretty 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.520
 complicated because the players there are 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.860
 They are here too vivid front 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.740
 I talk about the forwards because always 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.330
 they are moving sometimes they play you 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.819
 cut and this one plays long 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.740
 and there are different teams here in mexico 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:56.900
 and it makes it a bit difficult in Europe 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.689
 we know they are the best in the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.849
 world touched me play in Spain and good 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.090
 thank god I played in a team that 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.800
 it tends to be very important and that there was 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.530
 gained important things and arrives in a 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.289
 good time and with great players 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.869
 then it arrives like this and good 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.809
 suddenly you were a little impressed by everything 

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:21.819
 what what the dream that always 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:24.039
 you wanted to be able to play in Europe 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.839
 and good are the best 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.930
 today it is beautiful besides Seville is not a 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:31.360
 beautiful city but like this one you 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.919
 as a foreigner as you arrive and you adapt 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.349
 to Mexican soccer that was what most 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.569
 It costs work to adapt to football 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.119
 mexican good the truth 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.939
 I always try to adapt as soon as possible 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:47.680
 possible and be able to understand the body 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:50.809
 technical what what he wants 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.090
 we as defenses is not that it is 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:56.760
 something different in 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.340
 it's almost the same all over the world by 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.160
 because we are defenses and if we were 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.380
 front or flyers or whatever it would be 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.120
 a little bit more complicated then 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.530
 tell us if you had not been a footballer 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:14.639
 that you would have liked to be good as a child 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.440
 I always thought about being an architect and 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.360
 I was left with the oldest desire and never 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.759
 you can study it is not good but 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.740
 I could have studied it but in 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.159
 reality what I like is football and 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.500
 I got myself focused on what is now in 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.810
 career and already after you 're from the 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.909
 courts that I stopped jumping to 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.770
 field to sweat the shirt and when you 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.050
 retires that comes here goes from them 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.900
 You have donations to make the 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.800
 I really have no idea, sister, I do not have 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.419
 no idea but but well I think that 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.509
 manage things that things that 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:54.389
 thank God we have and good to live on 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.629
 what what what we have done so 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.169
 now 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:07:00.150
