you know especially with the lectures
everything<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> usually<00:00:35.040> based<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
everything is usually based on a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
everything is usually based on a
practical<00:00:36.179> example<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.679> theory

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
practical example of how this theory

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.880 
practical example of how this theory
works<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> evening<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
works and so when I'm in the evening and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
works and so when I'm in the evening and
I'm<00:00:40.949> when<00:00:41.100> studying<00:00:41.429> at<00:00:41.579> Birkbeck<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.269> have

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'm when studying at Birkbeck and have

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.689 
I'm when studying at Birkbeck and have
the<00:00:43.260> ability<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.679> read<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.190> learn<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.460> all

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
the ability to read and learn about all

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.459 
the ability to read and learn about all
these<00:00:44.820> great<00:00:45.449> theories<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.230> really

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
these great theories from these really

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.889 
these great theories from these really
great<00:00:46.679> minds<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.429> great<00:00:48.210> people<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.749> then

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
great minds and great people and then

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
great minds and great people and then
the<00:00:49.559> next<00:00:49.829> day<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.100> able<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.510> apply<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.839> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the next day I'm able to apply it and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.630 
the next day I'm able to apply it and
test<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.589> really<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> actually

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
test it and really see if it actually

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.930 
test it and really see if it actually
works<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.949> sometimes<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.249> doesn't<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
works and sometimes it doesn't and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.419 
works and sometimes it doesn't and
because<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.800> theory<00:00:59.249> and

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
because you know it's just theory and

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.809 
because you know it's just theory and
other<00:01:00.179> times<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> does<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.399> you've<00:01:02.399> come

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
other times it does and you've come

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.520 
other times it does and you've come
across<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.629> smart<00:01:04.050> guy<00:01:04.320> when

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
across like this really smart guy when

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.230 
across like this really smart guy when
you<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.769> remembered<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> learnt<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you just remembered what you learnt the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.249 
you just remembered what you learnt the

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
night before and you know and this kind

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.499 
night before and you know and this kind

of dynamic where you have the ability to

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.210 
of dynamic where you have the ability to
put<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> practice<00:01:13.649> what<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.009> learn

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

a<00:02:38.700> unique<00:02:38.940> example<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.970> about<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.240> a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
a unique example of that about like a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.780 
a unique example of that about like a
lady<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.560> call<00:02:43.770> center<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.700> know

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
lady in a call center and you know

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.180 
lady in a call center and you know
motivational<00:02:45.750> speeches<00:02:46.050> don't<00:02:46.470> work<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.920> any

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
motivational speeches don't work in any

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.540 
motivational speeches don't work in any
way<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:49.410> dynamic<00:02:50.010> works<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.400> me

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
way but so that dynamic works for me

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.890 
way but so that dynamic works for me
because<00:02:50.730> I'm<00:02:50.850> young<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.209> I'm<00:02:51.300> able<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.600> gain

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
because I'm young and I'm able to gain

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.030 
because I'm young and I'm able to gain
experience<00:02:52.350> for<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:52.770> then<00:02:52.890> also

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
experience for them but then also

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.490 
experience for them but then also
because<00:02:54.030> I've<00:02:54.209> just<00:02:54.239> come<00:02:54.900> straight<00:02:55.260> from

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
sure exactly what it is and it's just

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.199

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
maybe it's too much to say give them

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.160 
maybe it's too much to say give them
confidence<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.070> really<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.520> just

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
confidence that it really is just

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.800 
confidence that it really is just
remembering<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:17.330> theories<00:03:18.330> are<00:03:18.540> and

questioning them and writing them down

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.140 
questioning them and writing them down

of<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.190> free<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.760> he's<00:03:54.450> talking<00:03:54.690> about<00:03:54.750> no

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
of more free and he's talking about no

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.590 
of more free and he's talking about no
regulation<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:55.980> there's<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.940> strange

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
regulation and so there's this strange

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.360 
regulation and so there's this strange
dynamic<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.590> don't<00:03:58.799> get<00:03:58.920> anywhere<00:03:59.310> else

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
dynamic that you don't get anywhere else

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.300 
dynamic that you don't get anywhere else
and<00:03:59.730> I<00:04:00.060> kind<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.690> think<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.049> as<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.739> Birkbeck

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
and I kind of think of it as a Birkbeck

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.830 
and I kind of think of it as a Birkbeck
mindset<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:05.190> when<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:06.480> speak<00:04:06.750> to

mindset and you know when I was speak to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.090 
mindset and you know when I was speak to

one of my friends who wanted to become a
vet<00:04:08.600> my<00:04:09.600> response<00:04:10.320> is<00:04:10.380> well<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.620> should<00:04:10.799> just

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
meeting goes well I get some work

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.360 
meeting goes well I get some work
experience<00:04:26.849> and<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:28.260> think<00:04:28.289> that's<00:04:28.650> what<00:04:28.919> the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
experience and I think that's what the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.920 
experience and I think that's what the
amazing<00:04:29.789> thing<00:04:29.970> about<00:04:30.000> Burke

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
amazing thing about Burke

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.180 
amazing thing about Burke
is<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:32.270> changes<00:04:33.270> what<00:04:34.050> gaining<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.039> degree

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
is that it changes what gaining a degree

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.520 
is that it changes what gaining a degree
is<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.789> so<00:04:36.479> for<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> lot<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.840> people<00:04:37.169> gaining<00:04:37.470> a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
is and so for a lot of people gaining a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.659 
is and so for a lot of people gaining a
degree<00:04:37.800> it's<00:04:37.919> like<00:04:38.039> you're<00:04:38.190> on<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> conveyor

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
degree it's like you're on a conveyor

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.909 
degree it's like you're on a conveyor
belt<00:04:38.759> and<00:04:39.090> you'll<00:04:39.660> force-fed<00:04:40.229> information

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
belt and you'll force-fed information

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.650 
belt and you'll force-fed information
and<00:04:41.460> then<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.729> exams<00:04:42.000> comes<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.509> have<00:04:42.600> to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and then the exams comes and you have to

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.090 
and then the exams comes and you have to
kind<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.020> spit<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.740> out

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
kind of just spit it out

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.310 
kind of just spit it out
but<00:04:44.639> at<00:04:44.759> Birkbeck<00:04:45.180> it's<00:04:45.630> really<00:04:45.930> practical

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
but at Birkbeck it's really practical

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.320 
but at Birkbeck it's really practical
and<00:04:46.860> I'm<00:04:47.430> applying<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.910> things<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.210> I'm

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
and I'm applying the things that I'm

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.909 
and I'm applying the things that I'm
learning<00:04:48.509> and<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:49.110> remembering<00:04:49.770> it's

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
learning and it's not remembering it's

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.820 
learning and it's not remembering it's
just<00:04:50.509> experiencing<00:04:51.509> all<00:04:52.169> these<00:04:52.320> different

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
just experiencing all these different

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.590 
just experiencing all these different
theories<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.639> learn<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.449> that's

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
theories that I learn and I think that's

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.689 
theories that I learn and I think that's
what<00:04:54.780> makes<00:04:54.960> perfect<00:04:55.500> special<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:56.130> think

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
what makes perfect special I think

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.120 
what makes perfect special I think
that's<00:04:56.880> why<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.509> get<00:04:58.020> really<00:04:58.229> excited<00:04:58.770> and

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
that's why I I get really excited and

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.900 
that's why I I get really excited and
talk<00:04:59.639> about<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.120> lot<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.460> saw<00:05:02.610> they<00:05:02.729> keep

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
talk about it a lot and I saw they keep

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.260 
talk about it a lot and I saw they keep
on<00:05:03.030> having<00:05:03.180> me<00:05:03.389> speaking<00:05:04.020> at<00:05:04.320> these<00:05:04.470> events

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
on having me speaking at these events

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.210 
on having me speaking at these events
because<00:05:06.270> because<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.139> really<00:05:07.590> do<00:05:07.800> see<00:05:08.099> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
because because I really do see the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.060 
because because I really do see the
benefit<00:05:08.639> that<00:05:08.669> it<00:05:08.910> has<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:10.080> feel<00:05:10.320> like<00:05:10.530> more

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
benefit that it has and I feel like more

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.800 
benefit that it has and I feel like more
than<00:05:11.099> just<00:05:11.280> gaining<00:05:11.940> degree<00:05:12.270> over<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.630> two

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
than just gaining degree over the two

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.839 
than just gaining degree over the two
years<00:05:13.080> I've<00:05:13.259> matured<00:05:13.919> as<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> student<00:05:14.759> but

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
years I've matured as a student but

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.719 
years I've matured as a student but
matured<00:05:15.210> as<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.389> natural<00:05:16.050> person<00:05:16.289> and<00:05:16.740> someone

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
matured as a natural person and someone

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.400 
matured as a natural person and someone
that<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> bit<00:05:18.360> more<00:05:18.570> professional<00:05:18.870> than

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
that is a bit more professional than

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.830 
that is a bit more professional than
some<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.770> my<00:05:19.889> peers<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.340> yeah<00:05:21.060> at<00:05:21.660> other

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
some of my peers that yeah at other

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.070 
some of my peers that yeah at other
places<00:05:22.139> and<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.160> I'm<00:05:23.250> comfortable<00:05:23.520> in<00:05:24.080> these

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
places and so I'm comfortable in these

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.629 
places and so I'm comfortable in these
kinds<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.470> environments<00:05:25.620> environments<00:05:26.520> in

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
kinds of environments environments in

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.580 
kinds of environments environments in
board<00:05:27.330> meetings<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.960> everything<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.470> I

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
board meetings and everything and I

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.580 
board meetings and everything and I
think<00:05:28.650> that's<00:05:29.090> why<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.509> always<00:05:31.110> suggest<00:05:31.530> to

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
think that's why I always suggest to

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.650 
think that's why I always suggest to
people<00:05:31.979> if<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.250> have<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> real<00:05:32.669> focus<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.570> you

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
people if you have a real focus and you

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.600 
people if you have a real focus and you
