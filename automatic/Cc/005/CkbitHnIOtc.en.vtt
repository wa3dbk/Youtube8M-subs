00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
about now we have an idea of what we're

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.119 
about now we have an idea of what we're
going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.659> let's<00:02:06.869> talk<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.710> how<00:02:08.069> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
going to do let's talk about how to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.390 
going to do let's talk about how to
count<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.530> exercise<00:02:11.220> number

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
count and you can see on exercise number

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.210 
count and you can see on exercise number
one<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.060> page<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.959> we

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
one on this page that we

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.950 
one on this page that we
four<00:02:13.580> quarter<00:02:14.030> notes<00:02:14.060> each<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.810> those

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
four quarter notes each one of those

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.680 
four quarter notes each one of those
gets<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.590> beat<00:02:15.950> quarter<00:02:16.790> note<00:02:16.940> gets<00:02:16.970> one<00:02:17.210> beat

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
gets one beat quarter note gets one beat

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.110 
gets one beat quarter note gets one beat
so<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.230> would<00:02:18.350> be<00:02:18.380> strum<00:02:18.830> pattern<00:02:19.790> one<00:02:19.970> on

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
so that would be strum pattern one on

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.420 
so that would be strum pattern one on
our<00:02:20.270> sheet<00:02:20.480> today<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:21.350> strong<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.130> this

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
our sheet today be strong just like this

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:32.260 
our sheet today be strong just like this
one<00:02:23.230> two<00:02:24.460> three<00:02:25.750> one<00:02:26.750> two<00:02:28.480> three<00:02:30.940> now<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.120> is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
one two three one two three now that is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.190 
one two three one two three now that is
a<00:02:32.390> basic<00:02:32.630> strum<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:34.100> number<00:02:35.030> two<00:02:35.330> would<00:02:35.990> be

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
a basic strum and number two would be

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.250 
a basic strum and number two would be
with<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> down<00:02:36.890> up<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:38.030> would<00:02:38.180> be<00:02:38.260> quarter

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
with a down up and that would be quarter

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.710 
with a down up and that would be quarter
quarter<00:02:39.980> quarter<00:02:41.200> 88<00:02:42.200> or<00:02:42.470> counted<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.310> this

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.430

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
three four okay so let's say you have 28

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.260 
three four okay so let's say you have 28
notes<00:04:24.110> together<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:25.099> would<00:04:25.220> strong<00:04:25.490> one

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
notes together you would strong one

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.119 
notes together you would strong one
so<00:04:26.990> tell<00:04:27.289> none<00:04:28.509> if<00:04:29.509> you<00:04:29.870> have<00:04:30.080> sixteenth<00:04:30.860> notes

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
so tell none if you have sixteenth notes

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.279 
so tell none if you have sixteenth notes
together<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:32.210> would<00:04:32.360> strong<00:04:32.629> down<00:04:33.080> up<00:04:33.259> down

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
together you would strong down up down

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.999 
together you would strong down up down
and<00:04:33.710> 16s<00:04:34.520> are<00:04:34.610> counted<00:04:34.940> one<00:04:35.449> Enda<00:04:35.930> or<00:04:36.319> ticket

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
and 16s are counted one Enda or ticket

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.200 
and 16s are counted one Enda or ticket
ticket<00:04:37.129> so<00:04:37.940> here<00:04:38.060> we<00:04:38.120> go<00:04:38.979> downtown<00:04:40.210> downtown

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
that would be four sixteenth notes and

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.409 
that would be four sixteenth notes and

that's on the page as down okay so there

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.999 
that's on the page as down okay so there

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
get caught up in all the patterns and

get caught up in all the patterns and
all<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.319> all<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.740> things<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.550> basic

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
rhythms and we will begin to add

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.990 
rhythms and we will begin to add
syncopation<00:05:06.349> we<00:05:06.860> will<00:05:06.979> begin<00:05:07.069> to<00:05:07.280> add<00:05:07.400> accents

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
syncopation we will begin to add accents

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
make basic patterns sound really really

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.909 
make basic patterns sound really really
great<00:05:12.949> for<00:05:13.520> example<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.180> will<00:05:14.479> play<00:05:14.930> for<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.380> a
