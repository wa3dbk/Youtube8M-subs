00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.830
 very good girls very good guys in 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.740
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.839
 all very well today I tell you a 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.700
 very interesting news here a long time ago 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.009
 that we did not give this kind of news in 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.110
 the channel and is that the star breaks the 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.939
 speed record being ejected from 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.029
 the milky way by an explosion 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.250
 thermonuclear researchers 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 austral european observatory in a 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.450
 study published in the science journal 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.640
 they discovered a star that 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.100
 moves at great speeds what 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.050
 fast enough to escape 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.940
 of the gravitational claws of our 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.430
 galaxy so far astronomers 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.550
 they had discovered hyper stars 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.920
 fast that reached up to 850 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.820
 kilometers per second but in the last 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.989
 discovery 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.120
 this star called u s700 80 the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.120
 European researchers observed that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.850
 said top star exceeded 1200 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.530
 kilometers per second the authors of 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 this study consider that the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.520
 responsible for this star has 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.190
 abandoned the Milky Way would be a 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.500
 supermassive black hole that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.390
 found in the galactic core according to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.610
 they explained the interactions 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.100
 gravitational two stars with a 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.820
 supermassive black hole cause that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.009
 one of them exploded like a supernova 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.500
 while the second one is expelled to 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.190
 great speeds as a result of the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.590
 detonation 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.360
 all this is super interesting really 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.160
 there had never been anything like a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.350
 star would have left our 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.280
 solar system like that because I'm going to take 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.840
 by sack and really is not super super 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.930
 super interesting here you have the image 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.399
 on screen how it has been expelled and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.110
 nothing I hope you liked this 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.539
 this news I'm sorry to present 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.860
 golpista but I'm not I'm a little bit 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.920
 malita 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.870
 and nothing, thank you very much for being there 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.160
 always and see you in another video more than 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.680
 this channel and as always I tell you a 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.610
 lie questions my truths up 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.610
 the next chao
