00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 and we're going to win today's video 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.780
 Here in the car I stopped for a little 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.759
 take advantage of the time I come out of the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
 gym and I'm going to tell you one of the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.320
 steam stories today's 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 that is repeated on different occasions 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 but good fucking and bubas alike is not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.580
 issue of sexual orientation and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 the truth is that yes since it comes on 17 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.730
 may the day of no to homophobia we have 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.300
 to talk about a subject I in particular 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.770
 I always say that it is not a matter of being 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 gay or not to be gay of your preference 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.629
 sex is a matter of education and it is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
 level of consciousness because 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 go with who you sleep with that you do not 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 Bedtime does not make you better or worse 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 person however we all have 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.039
 a different chambita to apply in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.550
 this world and in this life he was aids 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.289
 to the title of the gym was full of 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.609
 godÃ­nez not all these executives who 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.500
 they are early and then to come to the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.390
 office and there was a group like friends 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.830
 then they talked that they were going to go 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 vacation to las vegas the week that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
 enters 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 if I'm leaving some 200 and then 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 Well, you can imagine the kind of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 talks not because we're going to grab 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.440
 some good old, good, good, there are 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.430
 the whores are different that falls here it 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.590
 you can do everything and there is no 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 so there's a problem 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.210
 if it is legalized and your old anything because 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.820
 I do not know that it is not that I am much 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.460
 much less however what I do not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.150
 Like is the way of expressing oneself 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.750
 Buddhas without generalizing about women 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.369
 treat them as something inferior the classical 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.080
 Mexican macho the one that all the old 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.830
 they're some whores all the old ones are what 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.660
 worse except your mom and sister then 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.430
 many times we are hard and 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.920
 give him that because the attitude of the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.720
 gays within the community because a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.509
 Sometimes we are so derogatory because 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.130
 sometimes you are simply talking about 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.009
 who has the active and passive role in 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.229
 a relationship because it is minimized there 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.550
 machismo everywhere and I do not think that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.410
 have nothing to do with orientation 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.690
 sex of each person but with the 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.239
 education to receive at home with the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.739
 madrazos that has given him life or more 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.330
 well with the level of awareness that 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.610
 has everyone is deciding 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 how your life lives better or not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 then let's stop thinking that if you do not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 transsexuals are better or worse than 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.490
 gays are promiscuous are better or 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.830
 worse than if trans people do if they 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.050
 lesbians because in the end we are all 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 human beings and the only thing that makes us 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.810
 different from each other is 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.240
 go the best human being we can 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.830
 come to be and I hope no one has 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.080
 sense assaulted by what has just 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.670
 say but is that we really think 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.770
 before speaking and let's realize how 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.170
 we express ourselves because it is not pleasant 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.700
 when you say it you do not realize it but 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.200
 when you are a little oblivious to the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.720
 conversation and nothing else are you listening 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.580
 to your environment and listen to this whole group 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.830
 of people expressing talk about that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.800
 really, it's not just that much 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:03.000
 but it feels one up wrong sometimes 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.910
 we were terrible we pay attention to everything 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.950
 what we do and only 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.960
 and here already in casual taking advantage of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.730
 way I forgot to tell you that this 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.740
 week starts with a new section of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.310
