is design at the build quality is
definitely<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.440> bit<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.800> premium

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the plastic get plasticky feeling in the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.590 
the plastic get plasticky feeling in the
a5<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.020> feels<00:00:46.230> even<00:00:46.469> cheaper<00:00:47.190> than<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
a5 that feels even cheaper than the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.560 
a5 that feels even cheaper than the
galaxy<00:00:48.600> alpha<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:50.149> even<00:00:51.149> though<00:00:51.239> above

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
galaxy alpha so when even though above

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.330 
galaxy alpha so when even though above
you<00:00:51.809> come<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.350> battery<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.949> any<00:00:53.190> one

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
you come from of the battery on any one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
you come from of the battery on any one
of<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.390> feels<00:00:54.570> better<00:00:54.840> here

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of these but it feels better here

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.250 
of these but it feels better here
aluminum<00:00:55.590> feeling<00:00:56.129> glass<00:00:56.879> front<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
aluminum feeling glass front here is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
aluminum feeling glass front here is
just<00:00:58.410> premium<00:00:59.010> feel<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.789> number

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just premium feel it's just been number

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.170 
just premium feel it's just been number
one<00:01:00.420> reason<00:01:00.780> they're<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.160> we<00:01:02.160> move<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
one reason they're if we move on here to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200 
one reason they're if we move on here to
to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> next<00:01:04.080> reason<00:01:04.400> why<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to the next reason why this one what the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
to the next reason why this one what the
iphone<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.540> better<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
iphone is better it's going to be

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.620 
iphone is better it's going to be
because<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.390> has<00:01:09.630> touch<00:01:09.990> ID<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because it has touch ID down here so you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.070 
because it has touch ID down here so you
can<00:01:12.990> use<00:01:13.290> Apple<00:01:13.770> pay<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.820> pay<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
can use Apple pay you can pay with the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
can use Apple pay you can pay with the
phone<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> also<00:01:17.369> unlock<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.970> device

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
phone and you can also unlock the device

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
phone and you can also unlock the device
there<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.470> very<00:01:20.070> nice<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.880> let's<00:01:21.750> go<00:01:21.869> see

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there it's very nice and let's go see

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
there it's very nice and let's go see
hear<00:01:22.500> touch<00:01:23.159> ID<00:01:23.430> touch<00:01:24.330> ID<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:25.200> cool<00:01:25.500> there

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
hear touch ID touch ID very cool there

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.080 
hear touch ID touch ID very cool there
and<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.759> number<00:01:27.740> three<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> third<00:01:29.820> reason

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and so number three and third reason

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.679 
and so number three and third reason
here<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:32.009> sim<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.390> true

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
here is because of this sim this is true

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.350 
here is because of this sim this is true
tone<00:01:34.020> flash<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.280> provides<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.119> better

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
tone flash so it provides it better

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.800 
tone flash so it provides it better
better<00:01:36.900> looking<00:01:37.320> pictures<00:01:37.799> overall<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.810> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
better looking pictures overall this is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.649 
better looking pictures overall this is
pretty<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.590> cool<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.939> terms

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
pretty pretty cool and you know in terms

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.780 
pretty pretty cool and you know in terms
all<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.920> flash<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.990> pretty<00:01:46.140> solid

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
all the be flash so that's pretty solid

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.850 
all the be flash so that's pretty solid
definitely<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:48.000> reason<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.470> number

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
definitely a good reason and the number

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
definitely a good reason and the number
for<00:01:49.890> thing<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:51.960> bit

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
for thing here is that it's a little bit

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.609 
for thing here is that it's a little bit
smaller<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.770> little<00:01:52.979> bit<00:01:53.250> easier<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.850> old<00:01:54.000> here

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
smaller a little bit easier to old here

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.319 
smaller a little bit easier to old here
4.7<00:01:55.619> inch<00:01:55.920> display<00:01:56.280> instead<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> 5-inch

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
4.7 inch display instead of a 5-inch

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.170 
4.7 inch display instead of a 5-inch
display<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.729> there's<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
display so you see and also there's a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209 
display so you see and also there's a
little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.659> rounded<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.799> it's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
little bit more rounded so if you it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.350 
little bit more rounded so if you it's
easier<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> hold<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.390> hand

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
easier to hold in your hand

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.010 
easier to hold in your hand
and<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:05.200> navigate<00:02:05.770> around<00:02:06.010> so<00:02:06.820> that's<00:02:07.540> another

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020
