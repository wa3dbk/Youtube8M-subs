00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.710 

hello<00:00:02.899> so<00:00:03.899> last<00:00:04.830> time<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.339> built<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.730> array

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hello so last time I built that array

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.970 
hello so last time I built that array
and<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.259> time<00:00:07.500> I've<00:00:07.740> actually<00:00:07.950> built<00:00:09.950> what<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and this time I've actually built what I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.650 
and this time I've actually built what I
consider<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.849> at<00:00:11.940> least<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.269> simple

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
consider to be at least a simple

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.929 
consider to be at least a simple
computer<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.269> let<00:00:15.269> me<00:00:15.450> show<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:18.830> um

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
computer so let me show it to you um

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.429 
computer so let me show it to you um
it's<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.150> overly<00:00:21.480> complicated<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.230> it's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
it's not overly complicated but it's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's not overly complicated but it's
less<00:00:22.650> complicated<00:00:22.769> thing<00:00:23.369> I've<00:00:23.519> built<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.090> far

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
less complicated thing I've built so far

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.380 
less complicated thing I've built so far
quite<00:00:25.140> proud<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> actually<00:00:26.150> what<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
quite proud of it actually what it is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
quite proud of it actually what it is
I'll<00:00:28.320> fly<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.890> i'm<00:00:28.980> sure<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:31.040> there's<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I'll fly over i'm sure you there's that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.200 
I'll fly over i'm sure you there's that
mess<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.329> decoder<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.399> those<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
mess of a decoder and then those are the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.880 
mess of a decoder and then those are the
memory<00:00:36.510> stacks<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:37.079> show<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> second

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
memory stacks will show you in a second

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.630 
memory stacks will show you in a second
and<00:00:38.010> those<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.340> pluses<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:40.640> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and those are just pluses for the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.830 
and those are just pluses for the
controls<00:00:43.430> alright<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
controls alright so what this is it's a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.180 
controls alright so what this is it's a
three<00:00:45.870> by<00:00:46.200> three<00:00:46.230> display<00:00:47.000> with<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.950> bit<00:00:49.950> lit

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
three by three display with one bit lit

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.510 
three by three display with one bit lit
up<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.780> controls<00:00:52.520> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
up then you have these controls you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
up then you have these controls you
click<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.320> with<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> delay<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
click them with a little bit of delay it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.900 
click them with a little bit of delay it
moves<00:00:56.730> around<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.270> display<00:01:01.039> it<00:01:02.039> even<00:01:02.340> will

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
moves around the display it even will

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.020 
moves around the display it even will
jump<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> side<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.580> go<00:01:05.580> too<00:01:05.640> far

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
jump from side to side if you go too far

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.980 
jump from side to side if you go too far
all<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> controls<00:01:07.350> work<00:01:11.390> every<00:01:12.390> single<00:01:12.570> bit

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
all the controls work every single bit

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.469 
all the controls work every single bit
works<00:01:13.260> oh<00:01:14.780> yeah<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:17.479> really

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
works oh yeah it's really really

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.929 
works oh yeah it's really really
interesting<00:01:19.520> I'm<00:01:20.520> sure<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.939> made<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
interesting I'm sure you have made it

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
interesting I'm sure you have made it
let's<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> controls<00:01:24.659> oh<00:01:24.869> there's

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
let's go through the controls oh there's

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.070 
let's go through the controls oh there's
the<00:01:25.860> controls<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> buses

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the controls and then there's the buses

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.950 
the controls and then there's the buses
that<00:01:28.350> ship<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> actual

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that ship these over to the actual

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
that ship these over to the actual
memory<00:01:31.500> things<00:01:31.710> let<00:01:32.250> me<00:01:32.340> explain<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.820> how

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
memory things let me explain to you how

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
memory things let me explain to you how
I<00:01:33.450> built<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> first<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.200> built<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> memory

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
I built it first I built the memory

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
I built it first I built the memory
first<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> wanted<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> figure<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.140> how

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
first because I wanted to figure out how

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.780 
first because I wanted to figure out how
to<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> first<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.640> most

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
to do that first that was the most

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.810 
to do that first that was the most
complicated<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:40.369> basically<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.729> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
complicated for me basically what it is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.249 
complicated for me basically what it is
is<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> controls<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
is the controls going through here and

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.990 
is the controls going through here and
I'll<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.470> explain<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> minute<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
I'll just explain that in a minute the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.030 
I'll just explain that in a minute the
actual<00:01:48.360> memory<00:01:48.869> bits<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.619> these<00:01:49.860> little

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
actual memory bits are these little

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.969 
actual memory bits are these little
piston<00:01:50.549> things<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.979> tried

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
piston things right here I tried

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
piston things right here I tried
flip-flop<00:01:53.490> gates<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.090> annoyed<00:01:54.360> me<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
flip-flop gates and they annoyed me and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.330 
flip-flop gates and they annoyed me and
I<00:01:55.110> couldn't<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> just

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
I couldn't get them to work so I just

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.030 
I couldn't get them to work so I just
did<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.670> works<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.630> block<00:01:58.200> solid<00:01:58.860> block

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
did this works if the block solid block

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.999 
did this works if the block solid block
is<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.409> often

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
is there it's on it's there it's often

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.380 
is there it's on it's there it's often
simple<00:02:02.399> enough<00:02:02.610> let's<00:02:03.420> co<00:02:03.659> put<00:02:04.049> um<00:02:05.390> really

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
simple enough let's co put um really

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.270 
simple enough let's co put um really
simple<00:02:06.840> memories<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.860> three<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> them

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
simple memories there's three of them

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.460 
simple memories there's three of them
because<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.610> three<00:02:08.940> by<00:02:09.060> three<00:02:09.270> display<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.110> x

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
because it's three by three display so x

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.309 
because it's three by three display so x
38<00:02:11.400> yeah

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
38 yeah

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.209 
38 yeah
the<00:02:12.379> next<00:02:12.909> total<00:02:13.909> 3<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.629> y<00:02:14.780> 2<00:02:14.840> o<00:02:15.079> 3<00:02:15.219> basically

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
the next total 3 and y 2 o 3 basically

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.470 
the next total 3 and y 2 o 3 basically
what<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:16.489> does<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.939> this<00:02:16.969> is<00:02:17.209> where<00:02:17.389> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
what this does is this is where the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.470 
what this does is this is where the
inputs<00:02:17.810> go<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.829> is<00:02:18.980> big<00:02:19.219> and<00:02:19.549> probably<00:02:20.209> could

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
inputs go this is big and probably could

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.379 
inputs go this is big and probably could
be<00:02:20.629> smaller<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.019> compressed<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:23.150> is

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:23.389 
be smaller and compressed but this is

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.869 
be smaller and compressed but this is
the<00:02:24.109> current<00:02:24.439> state<00:02:24.829> of<00:02:25.329> each<00:02:26.329> memory<00:02:26.870> and

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
the current state of each memory and

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.869 
the current state of each memory and
basically<00:02:28.879> what<00:02:29.599> happens<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:31.010> right

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
basically what happens is this right

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.289 
basically what happens is this right
here<00:02:31.909> a<00:02:32.659> good<00:02:33.500> day<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.810> right<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:36.769> is

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
here a good day this right here is

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.289 
here a good day this right here is
actually<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:40.459> going<00:02:41.030> up<00:02:41.239> or<00:02:42.040> four<00:02:43.040> yeah<00:02:43.969> i

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
actually for going up or four yeah i

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.729 
actually for going up or four yeah i
think<00:02:44.840> i<00:02:45.019> called<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.379> up<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:47.500> serious<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.560> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
think i called it up so serious I and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.420 
think i called it up so serious I and
gates<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.310> basically<00:02:49.579> they<00:02:49.790> check<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:52.310> of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
gates and basically they check is one of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.689 
gates and basically they check is one of
them<00:02:52.579> on<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.319> there<00:02:54.530> user<00:02:54.769> input<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.519> you

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:55.699 
them on and is there user input and you

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.490 
them on and is there user input and you
only<00:02:55.939> one<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.299> them<00:02:56.389> can<00:02:56.449> be<00:02:56.689> on<00:02:56.780> at<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.989> time<00:02:57.199> if

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
only one of them can be on at a time if

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.080 
only one of them can be on at a time if
not<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:57.889> broken<00:02:58.189> I<00:02:58.549> don't<00:02:58.730> feel<00:02:58.939> like

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
not it's broken I don't feel like

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.550 
not it's broken I don't feel like
building<00:02:59.419> a<00:02:59.540> safeguard<00:02:59.780> against<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.409> and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
building a safeguard against that and

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.280 
building a safeguard against that and
then<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.430> goes<00:03:01.609> over<00:03:01.909> to<00:03:02.000> here<00:03:02.449> and<00:03:02.599> what<00:03:03.260> I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
then it goes over to here and what I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.670 
then it goes over to here and what I
have<00:03:03.469> over<00:03:03.680> here<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:03.949> red<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.379> blue<00:03:06.650> is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
have over here is red is on and blue is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.050 
have over here is red is on and blue is
off<00:03:07.449> so<00:03:08.449> I<00:03:08.840> have<00:03:09.079> these<00:03:09.260> large<00:03:09.680> buses<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:11.000> go

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
off so I have these large buses that go

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.709 
off so I have these large buses that go
to<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.449> memory<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.109> I<00:03:12.919> have<00:03:13.359> three<00:03:14.359> on<00:03:14.480> and

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
to the memory and I have three on and

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.179 
to the memory and I have three on and
three<00:03:14.959> off<00:03:15.109> courses<00:03:15.500> through<00:03:15.709> memory<00:03:16.010> bits

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
three off courses through memory bits

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.580 
three off courses through memory bits
but<00:03:16.400> there's<00:03:16.609> two<00:03:16.790> for<00:03:17.000> each<00:03:17.319> since<00:03:18.319> there's

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
but there's two for each since there's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.659 
but there's two for each since there's
two<00:03:18.829> different<00:03:19.009> controls<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.900> say<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.739> did

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
two different controls so say you did

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.749 
two different controls so say you did
it's<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.509> memory<00:03:23.900> be<00:03:24.259> and<00:03:25.129> you<00:03:25.280> pressed<00:03:25.549> up

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:25.759 
it's on memory be and you pressed up

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.929 
it's on memory be and you pressed up
which<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.359> this<00:03:26.509> one<00:03:26.689> so<00:03:26.949> it<00:03:27.949> goes<00:03:27.979> in<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.729> it

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
which is this one so it goes in and it

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.499 
which is this one so it goes in and it
says<00:03:29.150> alright<00:03:29.479> be<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.079> on<00:03:30.669> AAPIs<00:03:31.669> press<00:03:31.939> so<00:03:32.419> it

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
says alright be is on AAPIs press so it

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:37.319 
says alright be is on AAPIs press so it
goes<00:03:32.689> over<00:03:32.810> here<00:03:34.389> to<00:03:35.389> this<00:03:35.780> middle<00:03:36.229> line<00:03:36.439> which

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
goes over here to this middle line which

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.059 
goes over here to this middle line which
are<00:03:38.329> ya<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.079> middle<00:03:39.290> line<00:03:39.439> which<00:03:39.650> goes<00:03:39.680> over

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
are ya the middle line which goes over

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.740 
are ya the middle line which goes over
here<00:03:40.310> which<00:03:40.579> turns<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.509> on<00:03:43.269> also<00:03:44.269> goes<00:03:44.479> over

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
here which turns see on also goes over

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.330 
here which turns see on also goes over
here<00:03:45.849> turns<00:03:46.849> be<00:03:47.569> off<00:03:47.900> since<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:48.919> was<00:03:49.009> on<00:03:49.159> be

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
here turns be off since it was on be

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.270 
here turns be off since it was on be
turns<00:03:49.639> me<00:03:49.849> off<00:03:49.879> and<00:03:50.239> then<00:03:50.299> it<00:03:50.449> goes<00:03:50.599> up<00:03:50.900> see<00:03:51.500> up

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
turns me off and then it goes up see up

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.530 
turns me off and then it goes up see up
one<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.699> see<00:03:54.609> then<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.699> course<00:03:55.939> the<00:03:56.120> down<00:03:56.299> or

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
one to see then of course the down or

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.089 
one to see then of course the down or
the<00:03:56.659> same<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.139> just<00:03:57.199> it<00:03:57.439> works<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.769> reverse

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
the same it's just it works in reverse

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.390 
the same it's just it works in reverse
order<00:03:58.900> I've<00:03:59.900> got<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.930> then<00:04:03.620> they<00:04:03.799> output<00:04:04.219> to

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
order I've got and then they output to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.529 
order I've got and then they output to
these<00:04:04.549> buses<00:04:05.319> which<00:04:06.319> go<00:04:06.650> over<00:04:06.889> and<00:04:07.040> actually

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:07.539 
these buses which go over and actually

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.539 
these buses which go over and actually
complete<00:04:08.539> the<00:04:08.569> order<00:04:09.199> on<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:10.009> the<00:04:10.099> memory<00:04:10.400> as

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
complete the order on to the memory as

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.059 
complete the order on to the memory as
in<00:04:10.759> like<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.150> turns<00:04:11.389> on<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.810> turns<00:04:11.989> off<00:04:12.259> which

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
in like it turns on and turns off which

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.729 
in like it turns on and turns off which
is<00:04:13.219> why<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.430> see<00:04:13.669> a<00:04:13.699> little<00:04:13.879> bit<00:04:14.030> little<00:04:14.180> leg

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.159 

and<00:04:17.519> then<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.150> display<00:04:18.599> goes<00:04:18.840> over<00:04:19.109> here

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
and then the display goes over here

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.390 
and then the display goes over here
these<00:04:22.169> buses<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.860> there's<00:04:23.099> this<00:04:23.220> little

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
these buses and there's this little

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.980 
these buses and there's this little
building<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.060> since<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.360> built<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.780> I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
building and since I built the I

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.600 
building and since I built the I
originally<00:04:25.380> built<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:25.889> around<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
originally built this around just the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.730 
originally built this around just the
memory<00:04:26.940> like<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.750> literally<00:04:28.050> was<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.410> room

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
memory like this literally was a room

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.499 
memory like this literally was a room
with<00:04:28.949> an<00:04:29.069> up<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.340> down<00:04:29.430> command<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.270> they<00:04:30.389> had

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
with an up and down command and they had

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.120 
with an up and down command and they had
these<00:04:30.690> three<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.139> it<00:04:31.289> showed<00:04:31.560> where<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:31.949> was

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
these three and it showed where it was

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.689 
these three and it showed where it was
and<00:04:32.819> I<00:04:32.910> figured<00:04:33.270> rather<00:04:33.479> than<00:04:33.660> just<00:04:34.699> redoing

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
and I figured rather than just redoing

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.960 
and I figured rather than just redoing
the<00:04:35.940> bus<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.509> broke<00:04:36.690> into<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.020> wall<00:04:37.199> um<00:04:38.099> so

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
the bus I just broke into the wall um so

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.420 
the bus I just broke into the wall um so
I<00:04:39.030> have<00:04:39.240> two<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.199> them<00:04:40.349> 14<00:04:41.310> x<00:04:41.490> 14<00:04:41.639> why<00:04:43.430> they're

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
I have two of them 14 x 14 why they're

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.150 
I have two of them 14 x 14 why they're
exactly<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.060> same<00:04:45.180> i<00:04:45.569> literally<00:04:45.870> copied<00:04:46.560> over

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
exactly the same i literally copied over

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.580 
exactly the same i literally copied over
and<00:04:47.430> MCEdit<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.720> they're<00:04:48.960> exactly<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.500> same

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
and MCEdit so they're exactly the same

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.300 
and MCEdit so they're exactly the same
the<00:04:50.120> top<00:04:51.120> ones<00:04:51.330> why<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.599> bottom<00:04:52.080> ones<00:04:52.259> X<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the top ones why the bottom ones X and

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.430 
the top ones why the bottom ones X and
then<00:04:54.000> when<00:04:54.270> all<00:04:54.449> that<00:04:54.659> is<00:04:54.720> done<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.289> those

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
then when all that is done and those

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.149 
then when all that is done and those
keep<00:04:55.650> track<00:04:55.889> of<00:04:55.919> that<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:57.830> then<00:04:58.830> by<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.009> way

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
keep track of that and then by the way

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.309 
keep track of that and then by the way
the<00:04:59.310> controls<00:05:00.180> go<00:05:00.360> directly<00:05:00.780> into<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.139> memory

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
the controls go directly into the memory

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.689 
the controls go directly into the memory
thing<00:05:02.539> it<00:05:03.539> comes<00:05:04.020> up<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.409> what<00:05:05.099> i<00:05:05.130> like<00:05:05.490> to

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
thing it comes up to the what i like to

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.089 
thing it comes up to the what i like to
call<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:05.940> decoder<00:05:06.659> I<00:05:06.990> think<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.710> decoder

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
call it decoder I think it is a decoder

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.370 
call it decoder I think it is a decoder
it's<00:05:08.940> basically<00:05:09.270> just<00:05:09.389> a<00:05:09.630> series<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:10.020> and

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
it's basically just a series of and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.800 
it's basically just a series of and
gates<00:05:10.680> that<00:05:11.069> you<00:05:11.340> know<00:05:11.430> x<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:11.940> y<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.599> make

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
gates that you know x and y and make

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.740 
gates that you know x and y and make
sure<00:05:12.840> they<00:05:13.319> line<00:05:13.530> up<00:05:13.819> so<00:05:14.819> this<00:05:14.940> one's<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.630> a

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
sure they line up so this one's a and a

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.529 
sure they line up so this one's a and a
and<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:16.259> one's<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.400> B<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.090> one's<00:05:18.360> a

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
and this one's a and B and this one's a

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.629 
and this one's a and B and this one's a
and<00:05:18.720> C<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.380> this<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.740> seeing<00:05:20.699> a<00:05:20.849> a<00:05:21.120> b<00:05:21.360> c<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.639> c

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
and C and this is seeing a a b c and c

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.270 
and C and this is seeing a a b c and c
you<00:05:23.909> know<00:05:24.150> simple<00:05:25.080> enough<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.469> then<00:05:25.620> those

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
you know simple enough and then those

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.439 
you know simple enough and then those
all<00:05:26.550> come<00:05:26.580> out<00:05:27.919> and<00:05:28.919> go<00:05:29.460> over<00:05:29.699> into<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.300> back

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
all come out and go over into the back

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.920 
all come out and go over into the back
of<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.719> screen<00:05:33.050> that's<00:05:34.050> simple<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.919> just

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
of the screen that's simple it just

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.870 
of the screen that's simple it just
takes<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:37.110> while<00:05:37.139> to<00:05:37.620> build<00:05:37.770> by<00:05:38.159> hand<00:05:38.490> literally

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
takes a while to build by hand literally

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.209 
takes a while to build by hand literally
the<00:05:39.150> only<00:05:39.270> thing<00:05:39.570> i<00:05:39.690> built<00:05:39.900> outside<00:05:40.139> of<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.770> is

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
the only thing i built outside of it is

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.550 
the only thing i built outside of it is
i<00:05:41.430> just<00:05:41.669> took<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.539> bottom<00:05:42.870> memory<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:43.380> just

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
i just took the bottom memory and just

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.950 
i just took the bottom memory and just
copied<00:05:43.949> pasted<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.580> on<00:05:44.699> top<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.360> itself<00:05:45.659> and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
copied pasted it on top of itself and

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.459 
copied pasted it on top of itself and
then<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:47.569> yeah<00:05:48.569> broke<00:05:49.259> through<00:05:49.469> and<00:05:50.000> built<00:05:51.000> this

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
then I yeah broke through and built this

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.159 
then I yeah broke through and built this
so<00:05:52.469> I'm<00:05:53.389> probably<00:05:54.389> have<00:05:54.659> another<00:05:54.810> invention

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
so I'm probably have another invention

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.740 
so I'm probably have another invention
soon<00:05:55.620> wait<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:56.669> by<00:05:56.759> the<00:05:56.819> way<00:05:56.940> see<00:05:57.000> how<00:05:57.599> it's

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
soon wait and by the way see how it's

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.240 
soon wait and by the way see how it's
kept<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:58.080> little<00:05:58.259> bit<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.590> lag<00:05:58.800> we're<00:05:59.099> like

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
kept a little bit of the lag we're like

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.309 
kept a little bit of the lag we're like
that<00:05:59.400> turns<00:05:59.610> on<00:05:59.849> then<00:06:00.060> that<00:06:00.300> turns<00:06:00.569> out<00:06:00.780> the

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
that turns on then that turns out the

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.070 
that turns on then that turns out the
way<00:06:01.469> that<00:06:01.650> I<00:06:01.680> programmed<00:06:02.490> it<00:06:02.639> it<00:06:03.330> actually<00:06:03.479> the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
way that I programmed it it actually the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.770 
way that I programmed it it actually the
bus<00:06:04.259> is<00:06:04.469> the<00:06:04.919> off<00:06:05.130> takes<00:06:05.610> longer<00:06:06.180> than<00:06:06.389> the<00:06:06.659> on

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
bus is the off takes longer than the on

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.070 
bus is the off takes longer than the on
so<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:08.039> on<00:06:08.310> signal<00:06:09.180> gets<00:06:09.389> to<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.719> memory

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
so the on signal gets to the memory

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.740 
so the on signal gets to the memory
faster<00:06:10.560> than<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.889> off<00:06:11.039> signal<00:06:11.460> so<00:06:11.759> it's<00:06:12.509> not

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
faster than the off signal so it's not

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.300 
faster than the off signal so it's not
like<00:06:12.960> a<00:06:12.990> glitch<00:06:13.349> or<00:06:13.620> recording<00:06:14.159> or<00:06:14.250> anything

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
like a glitch or recording or anything

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.999 
like a glitch or recording or anything
it's<00:06:14.699> just<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:15.300> way<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.539> was<00:06:15.630> programmed<00:06:16.009> but

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
it's just the way it was programmed but

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.159 
it's just the way it was programmed but
yeah<00:06:17.210> hope<00:06:18.210> you<00:06:18.360> enjoyed<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.690> video<00:06:18.810> all

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
yeah hope you enjoyed the video all

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.730 
yeah hope you enjoyed the video all
build<00:06:19.979> more<00:06:20.460> stuff<00:06:20.699> and<00:06:21.349> come<00:06:22.349> out<00:06:22.469> with<00:06:22.500> it

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
build more stuff and come out with it

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.830 
build more stuff and come out with it
and<00:06:22.919> true<00:06:23.569> thanks<00:06:24.569> for<00:06:24.719> watching<00:06:24.830> bye
