00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it's the Rams this is not true same old

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.799

Rammstein<00:00:44.120> there's<00:00:45.120> been<00:00:45.329> plenty<00:00:45.570> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
Rammstein there's been plenty of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.910 
Rammstein there's been plenty of
improvement<00:00:46.260> by<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> Rams<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:46.800> were

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
improvement by the Rams they were

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
improvement by the Rams they were
actually<00:00:47.100> only<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> half<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> game<00:00:47.850> worse<00:00:48.329> than

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
actually only a half a game worse than

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
actually only a half a game worse than
the<00:00:48.600> Cowboys<00:00:48.989> were<00:00:49.140> last<00:00:49.440> year<00:00:49.710> seven<00:00:50.430> eight

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the Cowboys were last year seven eight

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
the Cowboys were last year seven eight
and<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.960> they<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.199> been<00:00:52.379> making<00:00:52.530> strides

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and one they have been making strides

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.340 
and one they have been making strides
the<00:00:53.879> Cowboys<00:00:54.270> did<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> things<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the Cowboys did a lot of things that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680 
the Cowboys did a lot of things that
hadn't<00:00:56.039> been<00:00:56.129> done<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> Rams<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.270> far<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
hadn't been done to the Rams so far this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.990 
hadn't been done to the Rams so far this
season<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> still<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.969> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
season so I think you can still have a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
season so I think you can still have a
lot<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> optimism<00:01:00.780> even<00:01:01.079> though<00:01:01.289> such<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> small

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
lot of optimism even though such a small

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
lot of optimism even though such a small
sample<00:01:02.370> size<00:01:02.550> being<00:01:03.270> only<00:01:03.539> three<00:01:03.809> games<00:01:04.019> into

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
sample size being only three games into

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
sample size being only three games into
the<00:01:04.320> season<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> start<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the season we can start to see some of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
the season we can start to see some of
the<00:01:06.420> trends<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.049> Dallas<00:01:07.439> actually<00:01:07.770> becoming<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the trends of Dallas actually becoming a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.219 
the trends of Dallas actually becoming a
competitive<00:01:08.790> team<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.060> hopefully<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:10.200> them

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
competitive team and hopefully see them

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
competitive team and hopefully see them
string<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.830> wins<00:01:10.860> together<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> future

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
string some wins together in the future

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.300 
string some wins together in the future
so<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> said<00:01:12.900> three<00:01:13.590> stars<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> game

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so like I said three stars for the game

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.149 
so like I said three stars for the game

yards three touchdowns a 71 percent
completion<00:01:23.130> percentage<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.509> actually

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
completion percentage that was actually

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350 
completion percentage that was actually
his<00:01:24.990> lowest<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> season<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.130> far<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:27.240> he

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
his lowest of the season so far but he

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
his lowest of the season so far but he
did<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> hundred<00:01:27.990> thirty-seven<00:01:28.470> point

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

did have a hundred thirty-seven point
two<00:01:28.860> passer<00:01:29.310> rating<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.450> obviously

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
two passer rating which was obviously

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.380 
two passer rating which was obviously
the<00:01:31.049> highest<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.130> short<00:01:32.400> stint<00:01:32.700> now

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the highest over this short stint now

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.550 
the highest over this short stint now
his<00:01:33.659> numbers<00:01:34.020> were<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.350> bit

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
his numbers were a little bit

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
his numbers were a little bit
reminiscent<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.159> how<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> eggman<00:01:36.060> used<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> win

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
reminiscent to how I eggman used to win

days where you wouldn't have high
yardage<00:01:40.350> totals<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.899> high

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
yardage totals but you would have a high
