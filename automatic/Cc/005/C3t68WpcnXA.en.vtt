00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.040 
figured I would just kind of combine it
together<00:00:08.849> because<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.510> don't<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> lot<00:00:10.019> of

together because I don't have a lot of

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.290 
together because I don't have a lot of

mascara for my bottom lash line I feel
like<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.860> smaller<00:00:38.219> wand<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> can

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
like it's a smaller wand so that I can

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.930 
like it's a smaller wand so that I can
really<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.620> lashes<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.370> don't<00:00:41.850> really

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
really get into my lashes I don't really

mascara<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.300> feel<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.660> it's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
mascara because I feel like it's

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.900 
mascara because I feel like it's
lengthening<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.520> small

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
lengthening and the one is just so small

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.720 
lengthening and the one is just so small
it<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.840> gets<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> lashes<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it just really gets into the lashes you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
it just really gets into the lashes you
can<00:00:50.879> even<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.629> top<00:00:51.870> lashes

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.040

kind of rotate between this one and my
Beauty<00:01:29.430> Blender<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> 3d<00:01:30.659> HD<00:01:31.290> brush

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

Beauty Blender so one is the 3d HD brush
this<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.759> comes<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.479> angle<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> that's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this one comes at an angle and that's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
this one comes at an angle and that's
why<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.790> side<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.360> little

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
why I like this one one side is a little

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
why I like this one one side is a little
more<00:01:36.689> dense<00:01:36.960> than<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> other<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.490> applies

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
more dense than the other but it applies

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
more dense than the other but it applies
your<00:01:38.970> makeup<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> beautifully<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
your makeup just as beautifully but the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.149 
your makeup just as beautifully but the
last<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.720> 3d<00:01:43.200> precision

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
last one right here is the 3d precision

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.399 
last one right here is the 3d precision
it's<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.850> smaller<00:01:45.180> brush<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.810> I'll<00:01:46.170> use

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it's just a smaller brush and I'll use

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's just a smaller brush and I'll use
this<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.159> concealer<00:01:47.790> when<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> apply<00:01:48.360> my

back in love with his pal all over again

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
back in love with his pal all over again
I<00:02:38.639> loved<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.299> when<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.540> first<00:02:39.719> came<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:39.989> but

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
I loved it when it first came out but

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.740 
I loved it when it first came out but
it's<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.189> don't<00:02:41.639> know<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.209> started

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it's just I don't know I just started

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.819 
it's just I don't know I just started
loving<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.079> again<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.439> not<00:02:43.560> sure<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:43.769> it's

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
loving it again I'm not sure if it's

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.740 
loving it again I'm not sure if it's
because<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.280> summertime<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.510> meant<00:02:45.689> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
because it's summertime and I meant it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.409 
because it's summertime and I meant it
like<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.049> bronzy<00:02:46.590> coppery<00:02:47.340> type<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.180> makeup

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
like that bronzy coppery type of makeup

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.140 
like that bronzy coppery type of makeup
more<00:02:48.989> neutral<00:02:49.560> colors<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:50.909> probably

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
more neutral colors so that's probably

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.839 
more neutral colors so that's probably
why<00:02:51.569> but<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.620> look<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.159> today<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.489> use

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
why but the look that I have today I use

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.309 
why but the look that I have today I use
with<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> naked<00:02:54.269> palette<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.989> my<00:02:55.109> next

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
with the naked palette so my next

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.490 
with the naked palette so my next
favorite<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.919> my<00:02:56.219> NYX<00:02:56.909> eyeliner<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.349> what

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
favorite is my NYX eyeliner this is what

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.440 
favorite is my NYX eyeliner this is what
I<00:02:58.530> use<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.799> do<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> lot<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.310> my<00:02:59.549> wings<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.239> in

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
I use to do a lot of my wings this is in

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.800 
I use to do a lot of my wings this is in
the<00:03:00.540> color<00:03:00.799> black<00:03:01.799> noir<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.629> it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
the color black noir and I like it

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.349 
the color black noir and I like it
because<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> jet<00:03:04.620> black<00:03:04.980> eyeliner<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
because it's a jet black eyeliner but it

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
with them so I'm not sure yet i might

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.390 
with them so I'm not sure yet i might
have<00:06:43.670> to<00:06:43.720> but<00:06:44.720> that's<00:06:45.050> what<00:06:45.230> i<00:06:45.410> was<00:06:45.530> saying<00:06:45.770> the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
have to but that's what i was saying the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.990 
have to but that's what i was saying the
first<00:06:46.640> one<00:06:46.850> is<00:06:46.880> in<00:06:47.150> the<00:06:47.240> number<00:06:47.540> E<00:06:48.520> l/100<00:06:49.520> the

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
first one is in the number E l/100 the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.670 
first one is in the number E l/100 the
majority<00:06:50.450> of<00:06:50.480> these<00:06:50.600> are<00:06:50.840> a<00:06:51.290> little<00:06:51.470> bit

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
majority of these are a little bit

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.400 
majority of these are a little bit
dramatic<00:06:51.860> so<00:06:52.730> i<00:06:52.760> will<00:06:53.240> probably<00:06:53.660> put<00:06:54.230> these

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410
