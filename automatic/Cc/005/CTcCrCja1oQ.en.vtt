00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.629
 moin moin here is the one again 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.539
 weber hunter and as usual, except for the 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.920
 underwear camouflage is necessary I know 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.570
 Not 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.390
 the topic of today 's contribution should be the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.189
 spring sun be for now at the moment 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.430
 Many hunters are confused and know 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.290
 not exactly what pieces in march 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.149
 april 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.579
 From the principle you have to think 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:31.009
 that now is the time in the same 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.480
 hotten break that is the watch 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.850
 the freshlings the previous year 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.070
 tee off and start fresh 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.170
 to build the throwing kettle or too 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.149
 have already fished just the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.980
 strong guards fresh very much like early 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.769
 in the year that means some already partially 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.780
 in the middle of january end january and lead 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.940
 now the end of February, of course, already 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.679
 the freshlings with others watch 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.019
 are just about to draft the boiler too 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.030
 Build and others will throw the litter 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.100
 again only in two months 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.899
 lay out and throw the freshlings 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.210
 that is to say from the principle one should 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.879
 think about what happens when the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.340
 Rotten associations break up or still 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.670
 we did not break up 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.070
 Stronger saw that the brook about 50 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.650
 60 kilograms while a few smaller 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.850
 be about 30 to 40 kilograms free 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.220
 even a little lower 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 then we know the watch is still there 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.120
 in the last year with piglets 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.100
 and diebacher is only something 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 later in the year, that is fresh 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.850
 most likely is pregnant 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.530
 and keep the freshlings for so long 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.380
 until she realizes that her freshlings 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.940
 that this year set again 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 want to be and then in the moment 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.590
 will just stop the turncoat 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 knock off or even the previous year 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.410
 Frischlinge depending on how old the sauna 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.050
 At the time we stop 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.600
 several weaker ones are for example 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.490
 three to eight are about 30 to 40 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.500
 kilogram heavy are no stronger is 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.840
 then in almost all cases 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.030
 previous frischlinge just from 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.530
 the guard has been cut off and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.450
 which you can lay wonderfully 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.220
 at least sandel of course completely 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.140
 clearly have addressed that me 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.209
 no freshers at this rate 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.099
 The sound will normally be 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.530
 now at the moment 30 kilograms have the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.810
 fresh 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.240
 Only in the summer fresh that is only called 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.220
 in the area july july august where wo 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.360
 most of the hunters are not around anymore 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.700
 count small freshlings 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.069
 Just put your fresh vegetables because of this 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.840
 time from last year's frischlingen 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.790
 that will be the defectors this year 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.890
 which is compared to the old Bach 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.900
 of course that settled further back 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.910
 This sound is like the fresh ones 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.069
 only in the area may to august 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.900
 sometimes even in september 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.640
 that is the time in which we special 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 Of course, the time has to be careful 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.959
 in wheat and cereal high 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.230
 stands and how can not see 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.790
 very small freshlings are there 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.650
 you see a single one right now 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.860
 strong then is that in the rule 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.230
 a keiler so the watch the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.360
 usually keep completely in the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 near the throwing kettle on the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.100
 but if you see it stretch 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.890
 female companion across the field is that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.840
 their strong revier part and see 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.370
 the other revier part is then see 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.810
 this is certainly a keiler of the now 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.700
 still after to send out pieces 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.500
 are looking to make here at the moment 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.600
 tight radius, of course, want the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.310
 wake up in a circle of their freshlings 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.410
 Do not want to stay too far away 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.959
 just go as far as you can 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.540
 It is absolutely necessary to get food 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.430
 but of course you have to be careful 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.049
 now a single piece a strong one 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.180
 piece that it is usually the keiler in 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.829
 Of course, some people will fall asleep too 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.930
 a leading brook either the 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.410
 freshlings in the kettle or has them soon 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.640
 depending on the state in some 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.180
 Federal data and cellars 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.620
 shoot 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.870
 there you can on the brush 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.220
 orient if you see the brush and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.900
 in your state in spring the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.910
 keiler are free also likely course 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.450
 Just hit there and the basement 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.609
 shoot 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.260
 However, I give that to think that 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.630
 must light date already be relatively well 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.160
 and in the sauna must be tuned 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.900
 that you can recognize well in the brush 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.790
 otherwise you have to definitely the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.560
 just make a lot of fingering 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.840
 dangerous constellation in spring 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.120
 are always two more be 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.400
 that is almost always the case 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.109
 either make it to the eve 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.359
 are fresh or already fished 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.920
 if the things have already fished 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.420
 have two pieces on the number 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.370
 then you will usually be the freshlings 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.409
 already have, however, can 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.729
 of course, be very very small so 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.600
 that you have these little freshlings in the 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.360
 high growth can not see 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.370
 two strong fresh two strong pieces in the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.900
 Spring always means to watch the 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.880
 In most cases, these are 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.410
 make the ones that are still fresh or 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.760
 have already fished 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.530
 I would definitely get my finger on it 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.420
 just leave there you can only one 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.420
 mistakes make two strong pieces 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.590
 are in almost no case twofold 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.870
 always female pieces like her 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.420
 together and must there for the reason 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 be extra careful 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.740
 Of course we still have the pieces 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.180
 maybe I'll say that from the or 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.770
 the red ones are from three to eight 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.690
 freshlings or even two freshlings 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.760
 are usually good at recognizing 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.590
 short throw at the relatively weak 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.780
 venison poetry that's the way it is most of the time 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.820
 between 20 and 35 kilograms 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.400
 which can respond wonderful radically 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.050
 Of course, there also explicitly 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.850
 take care that no freshlings with 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.070
 Here are how you can exclude that 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.860
 just in the room in the one just grew 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.330
 night vision device uses something 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.040
 Infrared emitter has there you can see the 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.410
 small lights in front of the freshlings 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.360
 light up and can be quite wonderful 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.130
 while standing in the binoculars 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.870
 often can not see exactly 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.640
 from the principle is now a whole 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.340
 great season to stretch sound 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.720
 because the sows have little cover little 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.730
 the acorn mast has food 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.110
 used up on the master 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.510
 there is not much food left 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.550
 Now is really a time where you have one 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.830
 high distance can achieve and completely 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.570
 nice just the previous frischlinge 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.880
 who are also leaderless and relative 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.500
 undisturbed just start the clarification 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.610
 because the altbacher is not there 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.170
 can experience 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.210
 in this sense, I wish you 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.670
 Waidmannsheil and good sight good 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.510
 start-up and always a quiet hand of 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.510
 a hunter
