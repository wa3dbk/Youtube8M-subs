00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and steering and things like that that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.920 
and steering and things like that that
make<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.219> stop<00:00:38.550> make<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.570> isn't<00:00:39.809> as

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
make it stop make it go isn't as

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.590 
make it stop make it go isn't as
important<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.530> makes<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> stop<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> steer<00:00:41.600> but

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
important it makes it stop and steer but

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600 
important it makes it stop and steer but
as<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.870> look<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.410> replacing<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:44.100> upper

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
as I look at this I'm replacing a upper

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.900 
as I look at this I'm replacing a upper
rear<00:00:45.059> shock<00:00:45.930> mount<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> listen<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
rear shock mount and as I listen to the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.639 
rear shock mount and as I listen to the
radio<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.270> talk<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.719> Roger<00:00:49.110> Penske

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
radio just talk about Roger Penske

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
radio just talk about Roger Penske
buying<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.520> Saturn<00:00:50.879> company<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
buying the Saturn company and the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
buying the Saturn company and the
difference<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.860> how<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> company<00:00:53.789> was

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
difference is about how the company was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.880 
difference is about how the company was
structured<00:00:56.300> this<00:00:57.300> structure<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> pickup

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
structured this structure on this pickup

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.700 
structured this structure on this pickup
was<00:00:59.070> designed<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> fail<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.469> don't<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
was designed to fail I don't know if it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
was designed to fail I don't know if it
was<00:01:01.800> done<00:01:01.920> purposely<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
was done purposely or just out of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
was done purposely or just out of
ignorance<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> upper<00:01:04.979> shock

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.140 
ignorance but this is the upper shock
mount<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:07.100> it's<00:01:08.100> designed<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> sit<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.060> an

upward<00:01:09.360> position<00:01:10.070> like<00:01:11.540> approximately<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
upward position like approximately this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.999 
upward position like approximately this
against<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> frame<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> open<00:01:15.180> part<00:01:16.009> up

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
against the frame with that open part up

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.899 
against the frame with that open part up
and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.330> down<00:01:18.479> part<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.680> pressed<00:01:20.520> against

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and the down part here pressed against

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820 
and the down part here pressed against
the<00:01:20.970> frame<00:01:21.240> making<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> perfect<00:01:22.229> cup<00:01:22.560> or

you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.580> see<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.909> happened<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:28.040> granite

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you can see what happened here granite

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.350 
you can see what happened here granite
time<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.610> done<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.880> anyhow<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
time would have done this anyhow but the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.460 
time would have done this anyhow but the
powder<00:01:33.360> coat<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> which<00:01:33.900> isn't<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.290> best

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
powder coat it which isn't the best

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
frame and have this design here so that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.280

any water moisture mud would collect in

essentially corrode and rot away I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
essentially corrode and rot away I
realize<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.740> vehicles<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
expected life but that's just plain

expected life but that's just plain

to come out of it or it was inverted

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.160 
to come out of it or it was inverted
such<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> didn't<00:02:04.740> trap<00:02:04.950> stuff<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.170> maybe

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
such that it didn't trap stuff and maybe

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.300 
such that it didn't trap stuff and maybe
that's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> metaphor<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> whole

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that's a metaphor for the whole

companies here I mean Ford survived
barely<00:02:10.800> we'll<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.170> look<00:02:13.319> at

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
barely we'll see but as I look at

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
barely we'll see but as I look at
designs<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.070> these<00:02:14.190> vehicles<00:02:14.430> there's<00:02:14.820> so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
designs of these vehicles there's so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.210 
designs of these vehicles there's so
much<00:02:15.240> things<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.470> many<00:02:16.590> things<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.040> them<00:02:17.130> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
much things so many things in them that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.480 
much things so many things in them that
are<00:02:17.340> put<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.270> didn't<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.870> be

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
are put in that just didn't have to be

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.160 
are put in that just didn't have to be
maybe<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:20.850> achieved<00:02:21.480> an<00:02:21.570> easy<00:02:21.720> way<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.930> do

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
maybe it was achieved an easy way to do

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.810 
maybe it was achieved an easy way to do
it<00:02:22.320> or<00:02:22.410> maybe<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.710> was<00:02:22.770> designed<00:02:23.130> such<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.460> so

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
it or maybe it was designed such that so

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.950 
it or maybe it was designed such that so
that<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.060> whereas<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.630> could<00:02:24.690> sell

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that it would whereas that could sell

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.330 
that it would whereas that could sell
more<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.200> them<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.500> understand<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.040> too

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
more of them and I understand that too

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.490 
more of them and I understand that too
but<00:02:27.860> doggone<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.970> silly<00:02:30.500> so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
but doggone it that's just silly so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.990 
but doggone it that's just silly so
that's<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:31.950> observation<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.910> as
