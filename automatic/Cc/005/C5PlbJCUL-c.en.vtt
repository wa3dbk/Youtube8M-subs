00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
it's a little different the last time we

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.580 
it's a little different the last time we
dead<00:00:42.760> lifted<00:00:43.090> we're<00:00:43.660> gonna<00:00:43.780> spend<00:00:43.989> five<00:00:44.350> to

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
dead lifted we're gonna spend five to

dead lifted we're gonna spend five to
six<00:00:44.800> minutes<00:00:44.950> just<00:00:45.340> getting<00:00:45.520> our<00:00:45.610> core

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
six minutes just getting our core

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.819 
six minutes just getting our core
temperature<00:00:46.060> up<00:00:46.390> maybe<00:00:46.840> some<00:00:47.050> running<00:00:47.410> some

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
temperature up maybe some running some

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.979 
temperature up maybe some running some
double<00:00:48.160> unders<00:00:48.570> something<00:00:49.570> really<00:00:49.750> simple

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
double unders something really simple

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.690 
double unders something really simple
but<00:00:50.380> metabolic<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:51.040> get<00:00:51.160> warmed<00:00:51.340> up<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:51.520> ready

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
but metabolic to get warmed up and ready

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.430 
but metabolic to get warmed up and ready
to<00:00:51.760> go<00:00:51.910> then<00:00:52.600> we'll<00:00:52.780> be<00:00:52.899> cycling<00:00:53.290> through

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
to go then we'll be cycling through

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.250 
to go then we'll be cycling through
these<00:00:53.739> three<00:00:54.010> drills<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.930> Devils<00:00:56.170> will

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
these three drills and the Devils will

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.780 
these three drills and the Devils will
get<00:00:56.380> heavier<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:57.040> refs<00:00:57.219> will<00:00:57.309> get<00:00:57.430> smaller

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
get heavier the refs will get smaller

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.430 
get heavier the refs will get smaller
and<00:00:58.090> we'll<00:00:58.540> use<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.809> other<00:00:58.930> two<00:00:59.079> drills<00:00:59.290> in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
and we'll use the other two drills in

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.319 
and we'll use the other two drills in
between<00:00:59.710> sets<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.550> improve<00:01:00.850> our<00:01:00.969> movement<00:01:01.239> as

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
between sets to improve our movement as

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.720 
between sets to improve our movement as
we<00:01:01.450> go<00:01:01.540> along<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:02.739> right<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.010> we<00:01:03.100> got<00:01:03.250> Tia<00:01:03.489> here

to demo for us today let's go take a
look<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:07.180> first<00:01:07.210> move<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.780> we're<00:01:07.869> gonna<00:01:07.960> do

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
look the first move that we're gonna do

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.230 
look the first move that we're gonna do
here<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.830> straight<00:01:09.100> leg<00:01:09.310> raise<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.970> core

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
here is the straight leg raise with core

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.660 
here is the straight leg raise with core
activation<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:11.530> have<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> band<00:01:11.979> attached<00:01:12.460> to

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
activation we have a band attached to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.060 
activation we have a band attached to
the<00:01:12.880> pull-up<00:01:13.210> bar<00:01:13.240> here<00:01:13.660> Tia<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.770> gonna<00:01:14.950> lay

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
the pull-up bar here Tia is gonna lay

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.950 
the pull-up bar here Tia is gonna lay
face<00:01:15.399> up<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.880> you're<00:01:16.540> gonna<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.840> play

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
face up and you're gonna have to play

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.149 
face up and you're gonna have to play
around<00:01:17.170> with<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.380> distance<00:01:17.740> here<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.100> this

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
around with the distance here but this

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.109 
around with the distance here but this
is<00:01:18.310> what<00:01:18.460> we're<00:01:18.580> looking<00:01:18.610> for

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
is what we're looking for

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.660 
is what we're looking for
she<00:01:19.659> has<00:01:19.810> no<00:01:20.080> tension<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.799> band<00:01:20.979> when<00:01:21.520> her

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
she has no tension in the band when her

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.390 
she has no tension in the band when her
arms<00:01:21.940> are<00:01:22.060> up<00:01:22.090> overhead<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:23.680> she<00:01:23.860> pulls<00:01:24.130> up

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
arms are up overhead when she pulls up

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.370 
arms are up overhead when she pulls up
so<00:01:24.790> her<00:01:25.000> hands<00:01:25.270> are<00:01:25.479> directly<00:01:25.840> pointing

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
so her hands are directly pointing

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.600 
so her hands are directly pointing
towards<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.680> ceiling<00:01:26.860> there's<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.460> good

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
towards the ceiling there's a good

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.420 
towards the ceiling there's a good
amount<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:27.880> tension<00:01:28.090> here<00:01:28.830> that<00:01:29.830> constitutes

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
amount of tension here that constitutes

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.730 
amount of tension here that constitutes
the<00:01:30.520> beginning<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.119> rep<00:01:31.299> from<00:01:31.869> here<00:01:32.200> feed
