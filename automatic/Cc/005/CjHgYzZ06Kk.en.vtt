 this stone there you notice that the map is going 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.299
 disappear and will open the hole 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.949
 This may not happen. 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.439

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:03.759

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.740
 meeting the largest dike reb creb creb 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:42.480

 hole and here you will get this 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:58.850
 hole has the floor where will be the 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:58.850
 crustacean then descended and rises directly 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:10.190
 Yes, you do. It's here. It's already going. 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.260
 being in this corner does not appear 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.560
 another place 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:23.210
 watch out for one more credit blush 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:27.670

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.720
 and it is here that she seems to give 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.280
 backup 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:47.440
 There you have the one with the bad giants 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:51.220
 and having the chance to catch her is rare and is 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.180
 a restoration does not appear has no pain 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.010
 has date 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.520
 the staff has a way of talking if 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.440
 You picked up because you think it 's 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.370
 What time do you get the time that she 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:07.180
 It seems there is this or pro Panther and 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.400
 nor by the crustacean is it has to fit 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.880
 also only that it is easier it gives 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.150
 an invasion well does not appear one 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.700
 appears more and appears much more often 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.180
 common good 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:28.240
 I see you people meet almost all 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:31.480
 week or six months to 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.350
 Find and the panther I took five 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:38.290
 only the crustacean in six months seven 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.630
 months, I found 4 had more luck 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.990
 But I came to see more times, too. 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:47.710
 alone twice a day the panther and 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.080
 crustacean vineyards 45 times a day 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.090
 a doctor has not seen for a long time either 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.360
 but I will also make a video showing 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:07:01.720
 how to find the galley 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.960
 so this is it and I'm going to stay here 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.480
 this is where the 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.800
 main beam of the giant cup bowl 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.160
 You from the sea ​​stay with this mountain.
