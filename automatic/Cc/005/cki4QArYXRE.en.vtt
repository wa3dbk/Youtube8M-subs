knees cocked a little bit and he didn't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.719 
knees cocked a little bit and he didn't
do<00:01:47.670> anything<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.369> anima

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
do anything I don't just it the anima

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
do anything I don't just it the anima
the<00:01:50.909> whole<00:01:51.119> look<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> feel<00:01:52.409> will<00:01:52.649> looks<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the whole look and feel will looks a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.980 
the whole look and feel will looks a
little<00:01:53.189> cartoony<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> me<00:01:54.060> i<00:01:54.090> don't<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.420> maybe

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
little cartoony to me i don't know maybe

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
little cartoony to me i don't know maybe
and<00:01:55.320> maybe<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> wrong<00:01:56.009> definition

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and maybe that's the wrong definition

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
and maybe that's the wrong definition
because<00:01:57.299> cartoony<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.170> bit

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
because cartoony is a little bit

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.249 
because cartoony is a little bit
animated<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.460> yeah<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.110> thing

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
animated but yeah that's just a thing

animated but yeah that's just a thing
that<00:02:01.290> kind<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.590> bothers<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.310> get

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that kind of bothers me if you can get

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
that kind of bothers me if you can get
past<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:04.110> fine<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this is something that's plagued MLB

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770 
this is something that's plagued MLB
e-series<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> very<00:02:14.850> long<00:02:15.030> time<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
e-series for a very long time that's the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.770 
e-series for a very long time that's the
out<00:02:15.930> feeling<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:17.190> gets<00:02:17.460> very<00:02:17.550> jerky<00:02:18.150> sometimes

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
out feeling it gets very jerky sometimes

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.130 
out feeling it gets very jerky sometimes
I<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.430> there's<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.240> few<00:02:21.420> bugs<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
I I know there's just a few bugs and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.840 
I I know there's just a few bugs and
hopefully<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.710> fix<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.430> patches

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
hopefully they can fix that with patches

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.610 
hopefully they can fix that with patches
but<00:02:24.000> my<00:02:24.300> feeling<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.470> what

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
but my feeling on this and from what

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.750 
but my feeling on this and from what
I've<00:02:25.710> been<00:02:25.740> reading<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.610> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
I've been reading is that this is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.220 
I've been reading is that this is
probably<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> be<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> last<00:02:27.840> time<00:02:28.170> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
probably going to be the last time that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.030 
probably going to be the last time that
2k<00:02:28.710> makes<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.430> baseball<00:02:29.940> game<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.530> could<00:02:31.860> see

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
2k makes a baseball game and I could see

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
2k makes a baseball game and I could see
that<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:33.000> would<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.360> true<00:02:33.570> because<00:02:33.840> it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
that the that would be true because it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.360 
that the that would be true because it
just<00:02:34.140> doesn't<00:02:34.380> feel<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.710> they<00:02:34.860> put<00:02:35.100> much

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just doesn't feel like they put much

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.720 
just doesn't feel like they put much
effort<00:02:35.640> into<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.390> game<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:38.220> another

I'm<00:04:35.050> gonna<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.560> know<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:36.040> last<00:04:36.400> year<00:04:36.730> was<00:04:37.060> new<00:04:37.210> I

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
I'm gonna I know was last year was new I

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.140 
I'm gonna I know was last year was new I
didn't<00:04:37.540> have<00:04:37.660> last<00:04:37.840> year's<00:04:38.080> game<00:04:38.260> but<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:39.460> think

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
didn't have last year's game but I think

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.850 
didn't have last year's game but I think
I<00:04:40.210> would<00:04:40.360> join<00:04:40.540> it<00:04:40.750> makes<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.230> harder<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.530> throw

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
I would join it makes it harder to throw

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.260 
I would join it makes it harder to throw
sometimes<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.490> have<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.700> be<00:04:42.820> very<00:04:42.850> careful

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
sometimes you have to be very careful

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.030 
sometimes you have to be very careful
that's<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:44.020> took<00:04:44.290> me<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.470> while<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.680> kind<00:04:44.920> of

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
that's it took me a while to kind of

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.250 
that's it took me a while to kind of
really<00:04:45.310> get<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.610> down<00:04:45.970> because<00:04:46.930> when<00:04:47.200> you

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
really get that down because when you

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.630 
really get that down because when you
throw<00:04:47.440> on<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.650> run<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.800> little<00:04:48.130> bit<00:04:48.280> harder

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
throw on the run a little bit harder

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.380 
throw on the run a little bit harder
than<00:04:48.910> when<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.360> actually<00:04:49.740> would<00:04:50.740> throw

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
than when you actually would throw

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.580 
than when you actually would throw
standing<00:04:52.390> still<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:52.870> far<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.320> it's

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
standing still and so far so it's

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.770 
standing still and so far so it's
something<00:04:53.800> I've<00:04:53.890> to<00:04:53.980> get<00:04:54.070> used<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.780> here

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
something I've to get used to and here

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.050 
something I've to get used to and here
we<00:04:55.810> go<00:04:55.870> as<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.110> base<00:04:56.380> hit<00:04:56.440> up<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.040> middle<00:04:57.280> with
