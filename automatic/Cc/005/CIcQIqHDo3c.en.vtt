July<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.240> had<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.719> leaf<00:00:10.139> design<00:00:10.559> document

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
July we had this leaf design document

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.459 
July we had this leaf design document
that<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.309> suggest<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.599> new<00:00:12.780> measurements<00:00:13.349> on

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
that we suggest the new measurements on

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.779 
that we suggest the new measurements on
how<00:00:13.740> big<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.340> long<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.690> new<00:00:16.170> iphone<00:00:16.789> 5

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
how big and how long this new iphone 5

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.689 
how big and how long this new iphone 5
would<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.330> compared<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> previous<00:00:20.160> iphone

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
would be compared to the previous iphone

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.689 
would be compared to the previous iphone
4<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.230> saw<00:00:22.439> there<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.310> it's

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
4 and what we saw there was that it's

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.970 
4 and what we saw there was that it's
going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.119> slightly<00:00:24.420> wider<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> it's

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
going to be slightly wider but it's

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.580 
going to be slightly wider but it's
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.279> shorter<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.359> basically<00:00:28.320> what

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
going to be shorter so basically what

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560 
going to be shorter so basically what
macrumors<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.670> been<00:00:29.939> doing<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.449> is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
macrumors now have been doing here is

macrumors now have been doing here is
that<00:00:30.810> they<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.260> made<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.769> render<00:00:32.189> pictures

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that they have made some render pictures

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.690 
that they have made some render pictures
or<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.570> could<00:00:33.870> look<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.579> first

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
by you know you scaling down on the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
by you know you scaling down on the
slides<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.610> an

slides so if you would see this on an
iphone<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:10.140> wouldn't<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.830> surprised

or before they made out of touch 4g so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.859 
or before they made out of touch 4g so
that<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> should<00:01:20.310> suggest<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.970> ok<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> may

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
then they were saying oh wait this is
much<00:01:27.119> clever<00:01:27.450> design<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.770> by

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
much clever design in the you know by

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
much clever design in the you know by
you<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.640> cutting<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.240> cutting<00:01:30.450> down

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you know you're cutting and cutting down

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
you know you're cutting and cutting down
on<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> sides<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:33.030> made<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
on the sides and then they made it up to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
on the sides and then they made it up to
40<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.070> doesn't<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.880> an

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
40 that it really doesn't look like an

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.950 
40 that it really doesn't look like an
ipod<00:01:36.479> iphone<00:01:36.780> 4<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:38.060> Apple<00:01:39.060> made<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.840> know

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
ipod iphone 4 or Apple made you know

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100 
ipod iphone 4 or Apple made you know

the iphone and compared to ipod touch we
don't<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.200> yet<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.070> interesting<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
don't know yet but it's interesting that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.590 
don't know yet but it's interesting that
Apple<00:01:48.420> did<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> same<00:01:49.710> design<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.600> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
Apple did have the same design on that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.289 
Apple did have the same design on that
too<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> ipod<00:01:53.040> touch<00:01:53.310> 4g<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
too as the ipod touch 4g you know that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
too as the ipod touch 4g you know that
you<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.350> thing<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> size

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
you have that this thing on the size

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310 
you have that this thing on the size
that<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:57.060> down<00:01:57.240> stuff<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that is going down stuff like that so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.499 
that is going down stuff like that so
according<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.189> pictures<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.640> seems

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
according to these pictures that seems

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.700 
according to these pictures that seems
like<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> we're

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
like this could be something that we're

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.770 
like this could be something that we're
going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.570> on

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
going to see now as we can see here on

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.120 
going to see now as we can see here on
the<00:02:03.810> botanist<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.530> heard<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.070> are

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the botanist we have heard that we are

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
the botanist we have heard that we are
going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> rectangular<00:02:06.240> button<00:02:06.390> i

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
going to see like a rectangular button i

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
going to see like a rectangular button i
don't<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.459> do

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
don't think that they are going to do

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.499 
don't think that they are going to do
some

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
some

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.669 
some
you<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.689> I<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> be

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
you know I think this is going to be

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.860 
you know I think this is going to be
more<00:02:10.890> rectangular<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.180> how<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.569> around

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
more rectangular and not how like around

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.800 
more rectangular and not how like around
the<00:02:13.049> edges<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.439> as<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.099> it's<00:02:14.340> wider

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the edges but as you can see it's wider

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.080 
the edges but as you can see it's wider
it's<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.379> much<00:02:16.769> as<00:02:16.829> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.489> random<00:02:17.879> more

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
it's not as much as you know random more

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
it's not as much as you know random more
right<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.959> think<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.500> they're<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.829> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
right now I think that they're going to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
right now I think that they're going to
make<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.340> change<00:02:20.549> because<00:02:21.120> if<00:02:21.900> they<00:02:22.379> want<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
make this change because if they want to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.500 
make this change because if they want to
increase<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.010> size<00:02:23.250> these<00:02:23.879> times<00:02:24.209> they<00:02:24.450> were

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
increase the size these times they were

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.210 
increase the size these times they were
saying<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.319> are<00:02:25.349> probably<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.860> see<00:02:26.010> that

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
saying that we are probably in see that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.110 
saying that we are probably in see that
I<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.370> 3.7<00:02:27.150> inch<00:02:27.329> screen<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:29.040> these<00:02:29.489> features

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
I get 3.7 inch screen but these features

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
I get 3.7 inch screen but these features
here<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:30.540> CSS<00:02:30.930> helping<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.590> see

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
here or CSS helping out that we can see

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.589 
here or CSS helping out that we can see
this<00:02:32.310> edge<00:02:32.579> to<00:02:32.790> edge<00:02:32.879> mean<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.299> we<00:02:33.420> also

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
this edge to edge mean that we also

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.140 
this edge to edge mean that we also
heard<00:02:33.959> rumors<00:02:34.349> about<00:02:34.459> but<00:02:35.459> really<00:02:35.760> i<00:02:35.909> think

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
heard rumors about but really i think

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.460 
heard rumors about but really i think
that<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.480> Apple<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.959> change<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> home

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
that the Apple want to change the home

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.399 
that the Apple want to change the home
button<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.430> takes<00:02:38.609> up<00:02:38.760> too<00:02:38.909> much<00:02:39.409> it

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
button because it takes up too much it

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.770 
button because it takes up too much it
takes<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.739> take<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.879> too<00:02:42.060> much<00:02:42.090> space<00:02:42.269> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
takes to take up too much space and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.410 
takes to take up too much space and
other<00:02:43.230> thing<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.590> Iran<00:02:44.400> smaller<00:02:44.940> button

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
other thing that Iran smaller button

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.879 
other thing that Iran smaller button
looks<00:02:46.349> as<00:02:46.920> good<00:02:47.930> if<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:49.560> increase

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
looks as good if you you know increase

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.619 
looks as good if you you know increase
the<00:02:50.220> screen<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.269> look<00:02:51.389> weird

that late in july so that would suggest
that<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:31.919> can<00:03:32.160> see<00:03:32.310> even<00:03:32.699> a<00:03:32.940> bigger<00:03:33.150> screen

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
that we can see even a bigger screen
