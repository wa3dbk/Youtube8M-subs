map<00:00:24.600> pack<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.080> yet<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.800> highly<00:00:26.250> doubt<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
map pack out yet so I highly doubt a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.720 
map pack out yet so I highly doubt a
leak<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.150> early<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.599> even<00:00:27.869> possible<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:29.130> mean

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
leak this early is even possible I mean

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.630 
leak this early is even possible I mean
it<00:00:29.849> looks<00:00:30.029> exactly<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.840> other<00:00:31.520> DLC<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it looks exactly like the other DLC the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
it looks exactly like the other DLC the
first<00:00:32.820> DLC<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> four<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> five<00:00:34.140> squares

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
first DLC with the four to five squares

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.260 
first DLC with the four to five squares
right<00:00:35.070> they're<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.399> squares<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> pentagons<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
right they're not squares of pentagons I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.310 
right they're not squares of pentagons I
guess<00:00:36.420> let's<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.020> whether<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.290> are

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
guess let's see whether they are

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
guess let's see whether they are
hexagons<00:00:37.800> hexagons<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:38.910> you're<00:00:39.000> sick

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
hexagons hexagons because you're sick

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
hexagons hexagons because you're sick
sighs<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:40.050> geometry<00:00:40.500> but

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
sighs there you got geometry but

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
sighs there you got geometry but
basically<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.059> orientation<00:00:42.450> which

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
basically it's it's orientation which

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
basically it's it's orientation which
could<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.620> legitimate<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.280> could<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
could be legitimate that could be the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.639 
could be legitimate that could be the
name<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> next<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> next<00:00:45.570> dlc<00:00:46.050> map<00:00:46.200> pack<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
believe that and I do believe it is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a map mobile maybe I can't really tell

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
a map mobile maybe I can't really tell
where<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.140> hard<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
where where that is it's very hard to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
where where that is it's very hard to
determine<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.850> even<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
picture and plane I mean there's looks

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.740 
picture and plane I mean there's looks
like<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> plane<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> soldier<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
like a plane and then a soldier if I'm a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.030 
like a plane and then a soldier if I'm a
plane<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.020> looks<00:01:43.229> photoshopped<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.860> hell

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
plane that looks photoshopped as hell

that<00:01:44.520> looks<00:01:44.729> completely<00:01:45.210> fake<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> don't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that looks completely fake so I don't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:46.940 
that looks completely fake so I don't
know<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> believe<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:46.890> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
know if I believe that one at all that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
know if I believe that one at all that
could<00:01:47.220> give<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> away<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.759> there<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> then

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
could give it away right there and then

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
could give it away right there and then
the<00:01:48.689> zombie<00:01:49.079> map<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:50.040> background<00:01:50.490> looks

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the zombie map the background looks

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.219 
the zombie map the background looks
almost<00:01:50.939> exactly<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.570> die<00:01:51.810> rise<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
almost exactly like die rise with the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.749 
almost exactly like die rise with the
towers<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.189> zombie<00:01:53.610> arm

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
towers and you have one zombie arm

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
towers and you have one zombie arm
coming<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.979> about<00:01:56.159> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
coming up which I don't know about that

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
die rise but I was thinking about it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.540 
die rise but I was thinking about it
dead<00:02:04.140> hi<00:02:04.350> die<00:02:05.070> rise

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550

cool we got the next map pack details
about<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.420> early<00:02:37.600> even<00:02:37.930> though<00:02:38.020> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
about it this early even though it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.270 
about it this early even though it
probably<00:02:38.230> won't<00:02:38.530> come<00:02:38.560> out<00:02:38.680> till<00:02:38.770> April<00:02:39.160> for

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
probably won't come out till April for

probably won't come out till April for
Xbox<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.880> my<00:02:40.000> guess<00:02:40.330> my<00:02:40.960> guesstimate<00:02:41.440> probably

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
Xbox is my guess my guesstimate probably

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.100 
Xbox is my guess my guesstimate probably
April<00:02:42.040> second<00:02:42.520> or<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.670> 16<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.150> think<00:02:43.390> whatever

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
April second or the 16 I think whatever

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.810

Tuesday first tuesday in April's is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.580 
Tuesday first tuesday in April's is
probably<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> data<00:02:46.420> will<00:02:46.570> come<00:02:46.750> out<00:02:46.930> but

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
probably the data will come out but

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.870 
probably the data will come out but
other<00:02:47.740> than<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.950> guys<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.490> want<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.730> let<00:02:48.820> you
