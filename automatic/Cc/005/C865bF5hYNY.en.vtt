it's supposed to go now this machine is
extremely<00:00:54.990> versatile<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.010> does<00:00:56.340> take<00:00:56.670> some

operate as a regular sewing machine so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.609 
operate as a regular sewing machine so
it<00:01:04.830> does<00:01:05.040> take<00:01:05.240> patience<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> time<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.500> be

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it does take patience and time to be

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.459 
it does take patience and time to be
able<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.039> do<00:01:08.219> it<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.450> normal<00:01:09.960> serger

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.389 
thread is comes in a cone like this one
right<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.579> now<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:16.469> normal<00:01:16.920> serger<00:01:17.369> thread

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
right here now the normal serger thread

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.749 
right here now the normal serger thread
is<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:18.899> very<00:01:19.499> tiny<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.369> thinner

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is actually just a very tiny bit thinner

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.450 
is actually just a very tiny bit thinner
than<00:01:21.270> normal<00:01:21.899> thread<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.499> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> yellow

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
than normal thread and this is a yellow

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.480

thread that it's very difficult to see
only<00:01:26.850> uh<00:01:26.999> you<00:01:27.719> may<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:27.929> it<00:01:28.170> under<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
only uh you may see it under a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
only uh you may see it under a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
microscope but the normal sewing thread

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
microscope but the normal sewing thread
it's<00:01:30.719> just<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.200> tiny<00:01:31.499> bit<00:01:31.740> heavier

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it's just a little tiny bit heavier

it's just a little tiny bit heavier
thicker<00:01:32.670> than<00:01:32.969> this<00:01:33.149> but<00:01:33.929> there<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.609> can

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
thicker than this but there are you can

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.080 
thicker than this but there are you can
use<00:01:36.240> ordinary<00:01:36.600> thread<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.789> an

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
use ordinary thread now when you have an

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.239 
use ordinary thread now when you have an
ordinary<00:01:39.899> thread<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:40.890> use<00:01:41.039> on<00:01:41.219> a

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
ordinary thread that you would use on a

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.160 
ordinary thread that you would use on a
sewing<00:01:41.549> machine<00:01:41.670> would<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> spool<00:01:42.929> like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
sewing machine would be in a spool like

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.980 
sewing machine would be in a spool like
this<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.859> a<00:01:44.490> smaller<00:01:44.999> spool<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.749> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
this one or a smaller spool like this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.039 
this one or a smaller spool like this
one<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.889> we<00:01:46.950> would<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.639> able<00:01:47.819> to<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.389> these<00:01:48.749> on

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
one now we would be able to use these on

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.260 
one now we would be able to use these on
this<00:01:49.350> machine<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:50.039> we<00:01:50.249> wanted<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.639> but<00:01:51.119> we

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this machine if we wanted to but we

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
this machine if we wanted to but we
would<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.229> couple<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.829> changes

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
would have to make a couple of changes

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
would have to make a couple of changes
the<00:01:53.789> first<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.569> do<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:55.049> be

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the first thing we would do would be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.910 
the first thing we would do would be
remove<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:57.030> device<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.689> holds<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.649> cone

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
remove the device that holds the cone

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.669 
remove the device that holds the cone
thread<00:01:59.459> in<00:01:59.759> place<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.319> be<00:02:01.499> this

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
thread in place which would be this

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.550 
thread in place which would be this
little<00:02:01.920> device<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.639> here<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:04.020> hot<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
little device right here that hot that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770 
little device right here that hot that
fits<00:02:04.889> inside<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.579> cone<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.119> holds<00:02:06.539> it<00:02:06.600> in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
fits inside the cone and holds it in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.590 
fits inside the cone and holds it in
place<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.319> place<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.490> we<00:02:08.880> would<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.300> put

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
place in place of that we would then put

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.730 
place in place of that we would then put
a<00:02:09.810> guide<00:02:11.060> put<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.210> thread<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.290> we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
a guide put the thread on here and we

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.910 
a guide put the thread on here and we
would<00:02:13.920> put<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.160> guide

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
would put a guide

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.460 
would put a guide
the<00:02:15.040> top<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.790> course<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.420> whole<00:02:16.870> idea<00:02:17.140> of

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the top now of course the whole idea of

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.160 
the top now of course the whole idea of
putting<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.130> guide<00:02:18.430> on<00:02:18.790> there<00:02:19.120> would<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.780> as

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
putting that guide on there would be as

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.390 
putting that guide on there would be as
the<00:02:20.650> threat<00:02:20.920> untanned<00:02:21.810> winds<00:02:22.810> from<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
the threat untanned winds from the the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.550 
the threat untanned winds from the the
spool<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.030> would<00:02:25.300> not<00:02:25.540> become<00:02:25.959> tangled<00:02:26.230> on

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
spool it would not become tangled on

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.180 
spool it would not become tangled on
anything<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.400> our<00:02:27.580> emphasis<00:02:28.180> again<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.319> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
anything so our emphasis again is on the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.480 
anything so our emphasis again is on the
thread<00:02:30.520> not<00:02:30.819> being<00:02:31.090> tangled
