of how to do a standard spaceship a
model<00:00:05.819> shot<00:00:06.150> now<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.290> using<00:00:07.620> two

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
model shot now I'm going to be using two

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.680 
model shot now I'm going to be using two
cameras<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.610> do<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.970> I'm<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.389> using

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
cameras to do this I'm going to be using

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.299 
cameras to do this I'm going to be using
my<00:00:09.840> old<00:00:09.990> camera<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.420> HTC<00:00:12.420> SD<00:00:12.780> 60<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.530> I'm

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
my old camera the HTC SD 60 and I'm

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.960 
my old camera the HTC SD 60 and I'm
going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.940> using<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.250> Lumix<00:00:17.250> g5<00:00:17.730> which

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
going to be using the Lumix g5 which

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.450 
going to be using the Lumix g5 which
I've<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.570> hold<00:00:18.779> off<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.650> anyway<00:00:20.010> what

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I've just got hold off but anyway what

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.359 
I've just got hold off but anyway what
I'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.119> show<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.900> basically<00:00:22.890> I've

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
I'm going to show you is basically I've

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.060 
I'm going to show you is basically I've
got<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.699> slider<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.410> camera<00:00:25.859> moves

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
got a slider here and the camera moves

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.599 
got a slider here and the camera moves
little<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.550> travels<00:00:26.910> along<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> slider<00:00:28.609> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
little and travels along the slider and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.359 
little and travels along the slider and
it<00:00:30.240> allows<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.230> completely<00:00:31.859> straight

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it allows for a completely straight

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.180 
it allows for a completely straight
stationary<00:00:33.059> shot<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> be

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
stationary shot and it's going to be

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.150 
stationary shot and it's going to be
picking<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.239> shot<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> Lumix<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
picking up the that shot of the Lumix so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
picking up the that shot of the Lumix so
basically<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> purposes<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
basically for the purposes of this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
basically for the purposes of this
exercise<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.550> Lumix<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.450> spaceship

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
exercise the Lumix is a spaceship

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.279 
exercise the Lumix is a spaceship
although<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.430> strangely<00:00:45.180> shaped<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
although a very strangely shaped one so

although a very strangely shaped one so
I'm<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> turn<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.280> round<00:00:47.760> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I'm just going to turn that round so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.520 
I'm just going to turn that round so
that<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.590> beautiful<00:00:50.219> face<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.879> I

the<00:00:55.230> other<00:00:55.350> camera<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the other camera and what I'm going to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.860 
the other camera and what I'm going to
do<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.699> splitting<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> up<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
do is I'm splitting it up now so that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.759 
do is I'm splitting it up now so that
you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.320> both<00:01:01.530> cameras<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.439> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.619> now

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you can see both cameras and you can now

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.539 
you can see both cameras and you can now
see<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:06.140> from<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> purpose<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> point<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.430> its

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
see it from the purpose and point in its

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.210 
see it from the purpose and point in its
perspective<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.530> Lumix<00:01:10.830> being<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
perspective of the Lumix being a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
perspective of the Lumix being a
spaceship<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.240> overly

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
spaceship now it's not overly

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.460 
spaceship now it's not overly
complicated<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.970> nice<00:01:18.470> slow

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
complicated but you get that nice slow

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.520 
complicated but you get that nice slow
sort<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.369> pass<00:01:20.700> by<00:01:21.060> effect<00:01:22.189> now<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.549> camera

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
sort of pass by effect now this camera

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.130 
sort of pass by effect now this camera
slider<00:01:25.530> which<00:01:25.920> I've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.960> leave

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
slider which I've got I'm going to leave

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.280 
slider which I've got I'm going to leave
a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.350> link<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> description<00:01:29.490> cost<00:01:29.790> me

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
a little link in the description cost me

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.469 
a little link in the description cost me
99<00:01:31.290> pounds<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.460> expensive<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
99 pounds which is very expensive so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.560 
99 pounds which is very expensive so
it's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> lot<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> fork<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.360> model<00:01:36.360> shot

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's a lot to fork out on a model shot

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's a lot to fork out on a model shot
which<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:38.150> there<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.420> ways

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
which is like this there are other ways

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.609 
which is like this there are other ways
to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.170> such<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.280> example<00:01:41.450> I'm<00:01:42.450> just

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
to do it such as for example I'm just

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.490 
to do it such as for example I'm just
going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.920> stop<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.880> camera<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.540> seconds

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
going to stop this camera for seconds

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.740 
going to stop this camera for seconds
take<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> off<00:01:49.369> for<00:01:50.369> example<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:52.250> can

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
take it off for example then you can

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
take it off for example then you can
start<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.140> camera<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.680> again<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.210> always

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
start the camera up again you can always

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840 
start the camera up again you can always
drift<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> side<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.430> pan<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
drift out to the side and pan to the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.889 
drift out to the side and pan to the
side<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.570> hand<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:02.329> zoom<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.570> with

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
side with your hand as you zoom in with

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.499 
side with your hand as you zoom in with
the<00:02:04.049> camera<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.700> quite<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.149> effective

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the camera it's not quite as effective

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.790 
the camera it's not quite as effective
or<00:02:07.369> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.789> sort<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.450> move<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> camera

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
or you can just sort of move the camera

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.580 
or you can just sort of move the camera
around<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> side

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
around to the side

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.680 
around to the side
now<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.430> want<00:02:13.610> some<00:02:14.030> sort<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.420> dynamic

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
now if you want some sort of dynamic

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.020 
now if you want some sort of dynamic
turning<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.160> you've<00:02:16.310> got<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> very<00:02:16.640> steady

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
turning and you've got a very steady
