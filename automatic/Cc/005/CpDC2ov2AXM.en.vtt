all<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:49.000> seeds<00:03:49.299> behind<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:49.900> if<00:03:49.989> we<00:03:50.169> look<00:03:50.319> at

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
all the seeds behind so if we look at

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680 
all the seeds behind so if we look at
this<00:03:50.620> what<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.489> see<00:03:51.669> underneath<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.480> old

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
you've processed you're going to weigh

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.520 
you've processed you're going to weigh
it<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:12.879> every<00:04:13.180> pound<00:04:13.449> of<00:04:13.720> guava<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.409> you

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
sugar so inside a pot you're going to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.960 
sugar so inside a pot you're going to
put<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.359> guava<00:04:19.659> with<00:04:20.620> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
put the guava with the

put the guava with the
sugar<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.510> you're<00:04:22.110> just<00:04:22.290> going<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.560> keep

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
sugar and you're just going to keep

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.220 
sugar and you're just going to keep
stirring<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.430> under<00:04:23.760> low<00:04:24.000> heat<00:04:24.270> until<00:04:24.480> it

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
stirring it under low heat until it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.740 
stirring it under low heat until it
starts<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.710> thicken<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.460> you'll<00:04:27.150> notice<00:04:27.390> when

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
starts to thicken up you'll notice when

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.260 
starts to thicken up you'll notice when
it's<00:04:27.900> good<00:04:28.110> when<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.380> starts<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.860> thicken<00:04:29.270> you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
it's good when it starts to thicken you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.550 
it's good when it starts to thicken you
can<00:04:30.420> see<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.630> little<00:04:30.870> bit<00:04:30.990> right<00:04:31.140> there

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
can see that little bit right there

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.680 
can see that little bit right there
so<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.130> just<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.670> is<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.940> time<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
so you just this is the time this is the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.090 
so you just this is the time this is the
part<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.140> takes<00:04:34.320> time<00:04:34.620> where<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.860> have<00:04:34.980> to

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
part that takes time where you have to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.160 
part that takes time where you have to
just<00:04:35.280> mix<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.910> mix<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.420> mix<00:04:36.630> don't<00:04:36.930> let<00:04:37.050> it

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
just mix and mix and mix don't let it

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.040 
just mix and mix and mix don't let it
burn<00:04:37.640> low<00:04:38.640> heat<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.150> keep<00:04:39.480> mixing<00:04:39.720> until

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
burn low heat and just keep mixing until

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.090 
burn low heat and just keep mixing until
it<00:04:40.380> becomes<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:41.490> consistency<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.480> want

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
it becomes the consistency that you want

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.890 
it becomes the consistency that you want
once<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.820> get<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.330> right<00:04:45.480> consistency

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
once you get it to the right consistency

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.860 
once you get it to the right consistency
you<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.500> let<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.800> cool<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:50.690> here's<00:04:51.690> an

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
you can let it cool and here's an

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.020 
you can let it cool and here's an
example<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.560> it<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:53.220> notice<00:04:53.400> it's<00:04:53.730> really

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
example of it you notice it's really

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.690 
example of it you notice it's really
thick<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.450> like<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.630> jelly<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:56.160> could<00:04:56.580> have

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
thick it's like a jelly I could have

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.400 
thick it's like a jelly I could have
left<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.180> little<00:04:57.300> bit<00:04:57.630> longer<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:58.110> make<00:04:58.140> it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
left this a little bit longer to make it

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.570 
left this a little bit longer to make it
thicker<00:04:58.910> but<00:04:59.910> I<00:04:59.940> didn't<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.680> right<00:05:02.100> here<00:05:02.400> you

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
thicker but I didn't so right here you

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.150 
thicker but I didn't so right here you
would<00:05:02.730> put<00:05:02.760> this<00:05:03.090> on<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.990> cracker

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
would put this on a cracker

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.940 
would put this on a cracker
