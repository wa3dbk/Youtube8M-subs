00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.840 
pulling that a bit towards the nose your
eyes<00:03:22.350> are<00:03:22.560> very<00:03:22.709> close<00:03:22.950> together<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.489> wouldn't

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
eyes are very close together I wouldn't

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.060 
eyes are very close together I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.450> step<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.920> would

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
recommend this step but I would

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.039 
recommend this step but I would
recommend<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.579> next<00:03:26.850> one<00:03:27.030> which<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.299> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
recommend the next one which is to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.020 
recommend the next one which is to
extend<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.650> very<00:03:28.920> outer<00:03:29.190> corners<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> bit

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
extend the very outer corners a bit

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.960 
extend the very outer corners a bit
using<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:31.320> brown<00:03:31.829> just<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.489> just<00:03:32.640> going<00:03:32.910> to

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
using the brown just it's just going to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.060 
using the brown just it's just going to
look<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.150> bit<00:03:33.329> softer<00:03:33.750> than<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> black<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.530> just

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
look a bit softer than a black and just

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.560 
look a bit softer than a black and just
create<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.400> wing<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.030> see<00:03:36.239> what<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.510> does

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
create a wing and you see what that does

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.319 
create a wing and you see what that does
the<00:03:37.110> eyes<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.799> just<00:03:38.040> elongates<00:03:38.519> them<00:03:39.150> gives

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
the eyes it just elongates them gives

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.180 
the eyes it just elongates them gives
them<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.480> feline<00:03:40.079> effect<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.769> then

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
them that feline effect and then

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.830 
them that feline effect and then
