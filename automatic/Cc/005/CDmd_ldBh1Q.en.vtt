been really really dry and I've been
reaching<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> Vaseline<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> figure

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
reaching for the Vaseline so I figure

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
reaching for the Vaseline so I figure
why<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:31.080> reach<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.920> these<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
why not reach for one of these and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
why not reach for one of these and
you'll<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.630> color<00:00:33.930> payoff<00:00:34.260> on
