overdrive a request it is a pretty low
gain<00:00:17.250> extremely<00:00:18.000> transparent<00:00:18.410> overdrive<00:00:19.910> I'm

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
gain extremely transparent overdrive I'm

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.790 
gain extremely transparent overdrive I'm
playing<00:00:21.330> through<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> highway<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.410> strap<00:00:23.300> and

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
playing through a highway one strap and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.880 
playing through a highway one strap and
that's<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> sounds<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.650> this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that's what it sounds like so this is it

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.550 
that's what it sounds like so this is it
with<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.070> knob<00:00:29.279> straight<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.849> pretty

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
with just knob straight up pretty

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.680 
with just knob straight up pretty
standard<00:00:31.560> sound<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.650 

you

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.210 

so<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:45.080> typically<00:00:45.500> have<00:00:45.740> the<00:00:45.800> volume<00:00:46.010> down<00:00:46.100> a

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
so I typically have the volume down a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.380 
so I typically have the volume down a
little<00:00:46.340> bit<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.580> gain<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.760> little<00:00:46.880> bit<00:00:47.000> up<00:00:47.180> the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
little bit to gain a little bit up the

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.020 
little bit to gain a little bit up the
voice<00:00:47.660> pretty<00:00:48.020> high<00:00:48.230> in<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.739> base<00:00:48.950> in<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.820> mid

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
voice pretty high in the base in the mid

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:01.569 
voice pretty high in the base in the mid
area<00:00:50.860> for<00:00:51.860> what<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.010> like

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:12.029 

to<00:01:02.579> position

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.709 

so<00:01:13.039> someone<00:01:13.729> asked<00:01:13.909> we<00:01:14.000> could<00:01:14.119> do<00:01:14.210> John<00:01:14.479> Mayer

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
so someone asked we could do John Mayer

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.740 
so someone asked we could do John Mayer
tones<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:16.579> can<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:17.090> technically<00:01:17.420> we'd<00:01:17.659> be

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
tones and we can but technically we'd be

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.300 
tones and we can but technically we'd be
doing<00:01:17.869> Stevie<00:01:18.289> Ray<00:01:18.439> Vaughan<00:01:18.679> tones<00:01:19.039> because

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
doing Stevie Ray Vaughan tones because

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.669 
doing Stevie Ray Vaughan tones because
John<00:01:19.700> Mayer<00:01:19.880> steals<00:01:20.270> everything<00:01:20.600> from<00:01:21.560> his

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
John Mayer steals everything from his

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.190 
John Mayer steals everything from his
guitar<00:01:22.009> tech<00:01:22.219> Renee<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.840> that's<00:01:26.990> pretty<00:01:27.110> much

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
guitar tech Renee so that's pretty much

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:37.340 
guitar tech Renee so that's pretty much
why<00:01:27.380> use<00:01:27.530> before

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.260 

that's<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.500> coral<00:01:38.829> reef<00:01:38.979> vibrato<00:01:39.939> esque

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
that's the coral reef vibrato esque

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:58.480 
that's the coral reef vibrato esque
sound<00:01:40.689> just<00:01:41.020> getting<00:01:41.350> out<00:01:41.439> warbly<00:01:41.799> out<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.039> it

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.930 

so<00:01:59.490> yeah<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.330> pretty<00:02:00.570> sweet<00:02:00.780> pedal<00:02:01.140> uh

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
so yeah it is a pretty sweet pedal uh

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.520 
so yeah it is a pretty sweet pedal uh
like<00:02:02.940> I<00:02:03.060> said<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.659> my<00:02:03.869> pedalboard<00:02:04.229> demo

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
like I said in the in my pedalboard demo

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.730 
like I said in the in my pedalboard demo
it<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.799> modeled<00:02:05.190> after<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.580> Zen<00:02:05.880> drive<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> can

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it is modeled after a Zen drive you can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.960 
it is modeled after a Zen drive you can
still<00:02:07.920> find<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.410> board<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.679> Matt<00:02:11.220> bean<00:02:11.489> their

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
still find the board on Matt bean their

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330 
still find the board on Matt bean their
website<00:02:12.360> they've<00:02:12.660> got<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.069> but<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
website they've got it but it's got a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.040 
website they've got it but it's got a
different<00:02:14.400> chip<00:02:14.880> than<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.480> Zen<00:02:15.660> drive<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.930> have

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
different chip than the Zen drive I have

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.900 
different chip than the Zen drive I have
no<00:02:16.170> idea<00:02:16.230> what's<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> Zen<00:02:16.770> drive<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.670> is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
no idea what's in the Zen drive this is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.430 
no idea what's in the Zen drive this is
the<00:02:18.030> jrc<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.750> what's<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.110> tube<00:02:19.260> screamer

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the jrc like what's in the tube screamer

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.780 
the jrc like what's in the tube screamer
but<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.130> way<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.340> sent<00:02:20.550> through<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
but the way it's sent through the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.660 
but the way it's sent through the
processor<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.569> uh<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:23.069> doesn't<00:02:23.520> sound

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
processor it is uh it's doesn't sound

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.750 
processor it is uh it's doesn't sound
like<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.819> tube<00:02:23.970> screamer<00:02:24.150> at<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> that's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
like a tube screamer at all so so that's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.460 
like a tube screamer at all so so that's
max<00:02:30.030> game<00:02:30.300> by<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.510> way<00:02:33.019> it's<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.080> not<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> very

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
max game by the way it's just not a very

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.440 
max game by the way it's just not a very
high<00:02:34.800> output<00:02:35.040> pedal<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:38.840> sweet<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
high output pedal but it's sweet but it

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.699 
high output pedal but it's sweet but it
does<00:02:42.569> have<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.780> 60<00:02:43.470> B<00:02:43.590> boost<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.340> ate

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
does have a 60 B boost to it if you ate

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.320 
does have a 60 B boost to it if you ate
you<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.860> also<00:02:46.980> drive<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.519> way<00:02:47.610> too<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.030> I

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you can also drive it that way too but I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.790 
you can also drive it that way too but I
don't

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.480 

let<00:02:52.800> me<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.250> any<00:02:53.400> more

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
let me know if you have any more

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:04.380 
let me know if you have any more
questions
