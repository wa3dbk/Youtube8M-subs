into it just riding easy every day after
you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> train<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.060> sort<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you have to train that it that sort of

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
you have to train that it that sort of
intensity<00:00:30.779> already<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.769> never<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
intensity already it's it's never the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.340 
intensity already it's it's never the
same<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> race<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.750> example<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
same like in the race for example you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
same like in the race for example you
don't<00:00:34.380> -<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.370> need<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> races<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.270> why<00:00:36.420> we

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
don't - you need the races that's why we

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
don't - you need the races that's why we
start<00:00:37.590> straight<00:00:38.040> away<00:00:38.070> from<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> seem<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
start straight away from the seem to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.000 
start straight away from the seem to
really<00:00:39.450> always<00:00:39.809> focus<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.590> friends<00:00:40.920> I'm

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
positioning is really really important

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020 
positioning is really really important

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
really lot wrong anymore because once

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
really lot wrong anymore because once

the team got you in that position and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
the team got you in that position and
you<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.250> stated<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> course<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.270> fast

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
until about 500 meters to go and if I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
until about 500 meters to go and if I
can<00:01:35.700> make<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.060> till<00:01:36.210> 200<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.900> better<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
can make it till 200 it's better so I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.859 
can make it till 200 it's better so I
just<00:01:37.829> tried<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> 500<00:01:39.689> meters

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just tried to go all out to a 500 meters

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
just tried to go all out to a 500 meters
to<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.439> realize<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.579> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
to go and then realize that was going to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.280 
to go and then realize that was going to
have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.000> 300<00:01:42.570> more

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
have to do 300 more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
so that was really painful a couple days

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.580 
so that was really painful a couple days
ago<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:49.240> almost<00:01:49.390> had<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.750> crash<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.200> training

time yeah
something<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:23.890> really<00:02:24.220> done<00:02:24.370> yeah

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:43.970 

never<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:40.700> think<00:02:41.700> myself<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.450> guess<00:02:43.140> going

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
never I think myself I guess going

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.130 
never I think myself I guess going
downhill<00:02:44.310> good<00:02:44.970> bit<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> Norway<00:02:45.750> just

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
downhill good bit of Norway just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.680 
downhill good bit of Norway just
pitching<00:02:46.590> them<00:02:47.100> faster<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.470> physics

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
pitching them faster this is physics

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.850 
pitching them faster this is physics
he's<00:02:51.690> got<00:02:51.870> some<00:02:52.020> good<00:02:52.140> skills<00:02:52.350> y'all<00:02:52.620> being

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
he's got some good skills y'all being

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.710 
he's got some good skills y'all being
most<00:02:53.280> great<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.730> got<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.240> good<00:02:54.390> skills

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
most great just got really good skills

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.100 
most great just got really good skills
and<00:02:54.930> he<00:02:55.200> obviously<00:02:55.640> has<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.850> try<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.150> catch<00:02:57.900> up

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and he obviously has to try to catch up

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.110 
and he obviously has to try to catch up
to<00:02:58.230> me<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> distance<00:02:58.950> cuz<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.370> climb<00:02:59.610> faster

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.690 

done<00:03:06.120> really<00:03:06.330> well<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:07.070> brand<00:03:08.070> new<00:03:08.250> helmets

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
done really well for brand new helmets

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.430 
done really well for brand new helmets
it's<00:03:08.910> all<00:03:09.120> all<00:03:09.480> brand<00:03:09.780> new<00:03:09.900> design<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
it's all all brand new design and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.260 
it's all all brand new design and
everything<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.430> they're<00:03:11.640> actually<00:03:11.730> very

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
everything and it they're actually very

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.680 
everything and it they're actually very
comfortable<00:03:13.160> myself<00:03:14.160> was<00:03:14.490> wearing<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
comfortable myself was wearing the the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.900 
comfortable myself was wearing the the
aerodynamic<00:03:16.350> helmet<00:03:16.500> yesterday<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.670> pretty

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
aerodynamic helmet yesterday it's pretty

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.850 
aerodynamic helmet yesterday it's pretty
cool<00:03:18.300> still<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:18.959> an<00:03:19.080> aerodynamic<00:03:19.620> cowboy

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
cool still for an aerodynamic cowboy

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.350 
cool still for an aerodynamic cowboy
very<00:03:20.130> often<00:03:20.430> that's<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.670> problem<00:03:21.030> because<00:03:21.090> it's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
very often that's a problem because it's

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.320 
very often that's a problem because it's
completely<00:03:21.830> closed<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.850> get<00:03:23.940> pretty<00:03:24.120> hot

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
completely closed and you get pretty hot

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.040 
completely closed and you get pretty hot
head<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.410> will<00:03:25.709> try<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:25.980> wear<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.459> on

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
head on that I will try to wear it on

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.420 
head on that I will try to wear it on
stages<00:03:28.050> where<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.350> think<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.100> would<00:03:29.250> be<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
stages where I think that it would be a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.180 
stages where I think that it would be a
sprint<00:03:29.760> at<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.970> ends<00:03:30.209> or<00:03:30.740> where<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.830> can<00:03:32.010> make

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
sprint at the ends or where it can make

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.440 
sprint at the ends or where it can make
a<00:03:32.220> difference<00:03:34.340> yeah<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.610> used<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.030> propel

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
a difference yeah I used to propel

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.970 
a difference yeah I used to propel
people<00:03:36.810> for<00:03:37.170> me<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.410> as<00:03:37.530> princess<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> very

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
people for me as as princess the very

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.580 
people for me as as princess the very
bike<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:40.420> about<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:40.720> grid<00:03:40.930> yesterday

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
bike think about the grid yesterday

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.369 
bike think about the grid yesterday
somebody<00:03:42.069> sprinted<00:03:42.760> around<00:03:43.599> 72<00:03:44.049> kilometres

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
somebody sprinted around 72 kilometres

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.080 
somebody sprinted around 72 kilometres
problem<00:03:45.099> and<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.400> all<00:03:45.580> about<00:03:45.790> every

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
problem and it's all about every

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.589 
problem and it's all about every
dynamics<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.590> very<00:03:47.769> stiff<00:03:48.330> my<00:03:49.330> weight

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
dynamics and it's very stiff my weight

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.420 
dynamics and it's very stiff my weight
weight<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.110> my<00:03:50.200> power<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.709> really<00:03:51.099> deeper

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
weight and my power I really deeper

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.100 
weight and my power I really deeper
stood<00:03:52.269> by<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.720> my<00:03:52.870> ass<00:03:53.049> and<00:03:53.730> that's<00:03:55.110> that's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
stood by on my ass and that's that's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.739 
stood by on my ass and that's that's
what<00:03:56.319> I<00:03:56.349> have<00:03:56.530> with
