I've<00:00:30.240> noticed<00:00:30.720> while<00:00:30.900> we're<00:00:31.140> standing<00:00:31.440> here

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
I've noticed while we're standing here

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
I've noticed while we're standing here
is<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.840> his<00:00:34.050> back<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
is that you look at his back and it is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.290 
is that you look at his back and it is
pretty<00:00:37.020> level<00:00:39.140> even<00:00:40.140> though<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.940> bubble

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
on the saddle indicated he was a little

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.119 
on the saddle indicated he was a little
low<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.580> front<00:00:45.260> when<00:00:46.260> Chuck<00:00:46.559> gets<00:00:46.830> in<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129

predominantly back here forcing that
candle<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> need

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
candle down so we're not going to need

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.439 
candle down so we're not going to need
much<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:53.580> of<00:00:53.729> shimming<00:00:56.330> we're<00:00:57.330> going

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
much in the way of shimming we're going

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000 
much in the way of shimming we're going
to<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.229> here<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.769> front

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
to need a little bit here in the front

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
to need a little bit here in the front
just<00:00:59.309> to<00:01:00.030> fill<00:01:00.330> that<00:01:00.360> pocket<00:01:01.110> where<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
just to fill that pocket where the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.170 
just to fill that pocket where the
scapula<00:01:02.070> rotates<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.690> does<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.940> push<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
scapula rotates so it does not push the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.590 
scapula rotates so it does not push the
saddleback<00:01:06.920> rather<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.250> compresses<00:01:08.760> foam<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
saddleback rather it compresses foam and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
saddleback rather it compresses foam and
you<00:01:09.690> can<00:01:09.870> see<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.470> shim<00:01:11.240> ends<00:01:12.240> at<00:01:12.360> mid

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can see that this shim ends at mid

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.110 
you can see that this shim ends at mid
back<00:01:12.870> which<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.440> also<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.100> center<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.640> his<00:01:14.880> low

spot if we ran the shim any further back
than<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:19.079> it<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:20.070> tip<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> candle<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
than this it would tip the candle or to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.440 
than this it would tip the candle or to
pick<00:01:21.539> the<00:01:21.659> cattle<00:01:22.079> up<00:01:22.850> tipping<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.969> pommel

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
shoulder and we would have weight

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190

pretty uniform sweat pattern we can

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.690 
pretty uniform sweat pattern we can
fine-tune<00:02:12.960> this<00:02:13.530> even<00:02:13.920> further<00:02:14.100> by<00:02:14.400> moving

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.140 
a little farther back so if you want to
establish<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.740> relationship<00:02:23.010> between<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
establish that relationship between the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.420 
establish that relationship between the
shims<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.830> foam

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
shims in the foam

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
shims in the foam
before<00:02:27.239> putting<00:02:27.540> anything<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.650> can

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
before putting anything on so you can

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:38.100 
before putting anything on so you can
get<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.099> visual<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:30.450> want<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.750> use<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.079> side

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.130 

we'll<00:02:39.110> take<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.530> foam<00:02:39.860> out<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.900> we<00:02:41.989> know

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
we'll take this foam out and we know

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.300 
we'll take this foam out and we know
that<00:02:42.170> we're<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.620> be<00:02:42.709> right<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:42.980> around

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
that we're going to be right up around

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.300 
that we're going to be right up around
here<00:02:43.700> with<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.000> front<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.450> saddle<00:02:45.310> okay

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
here with the front of the saddle okay

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.479 
here with the front of the saddle okay
so<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.690> dry<00:02:47.959> state<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.800> see<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
so in the dry state you can see that the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.490 
so in the dry state you can see that the
the<00:02:49.849> foam<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.330> little<00:02:50.660> lower<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> front

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
the foam is a little lower in the front

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.460 
the foam is a little lower in the front
than<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.129> back

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.420 

so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.610 
so
here's<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.269> mid-back<00:03:02.689> here's<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.200> back<00:03:03.379> of

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
here's the mid-back here's the back of

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.470 
here's the mid-back here's the back of
the<00:03:03.680> shim<00:03:04.180> we<00:03:05.180> put<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.569> shim<00:03:05.810> under<00:03:06.049> there<00:03:07.480> now

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the shim we put the shim under there now

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.559 
the shim we put the shim under there now
we<00:03:08.540> have<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.109> foam<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:09.879> voila<00:03:10.879> we've<00:03:11.329> got<00:03:11.540> a

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
we have the foam and voila we've got a

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.000 
we have the foam and voila we've got a
level<00:03:11.840> top<00:03:12.170> line<00:03:12.969> and<00:03:14.109> even<00:03:15.109> with<00:03:15.530> Chuck<00:03:15.829> in

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:18.969 
the saddle because of the laminated foam

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.410 
the saddle because of the laminated foam
it<00:03:19.969> is<00:03:20.000> not<00:03:20.389> going<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.659> compress<00:03:21.139> in<00:03:21.909> yield<00:03:22.909> to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
it is not going to compress in yield to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.149 
it is not going to compress in yield to
the<00:03:23.540> pressure<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.170> front<00:03:24.469> especially

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159

Lindy's<00:03:25.790> posting<00:03:27.099> we<00:03:28.099> should<00:03:28.310> see<00:03:28.519> all<00:03:28.670> this

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
Lindy's posting we should see all this

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.490 
Lindy's posting we should see all this
reflected<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.109> uniform<00:03:30.500> sweat<00:03:30.859> pattern<00:03:31.099> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
reflected in a uniform sweat pattern and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.770 
reflected in a uniform sweat pattern and
that's<00:03:33.500> really<00:03:34.010> all<00:03:34.459> there<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.510> shimmy

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
that's really all there is to shimmy

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.800 
that's really all there is to shimmy
it's<00:03:36.439> not<00:03:36.650> as<00:03:36.859> complex<00:03:37.400> as<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.760> think<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
it's not as complex as you think the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.129 
it's not as complex as you think the
variables<00:03:39.500> are<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.919> thickness<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.760> shim

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
variables are the thickness of the shim

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.289 
variables are the thickness of the shim
the<00:03:42.139> length<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.829> shim<00:03:43.129> and<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:44.120> is

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
the length of the shim and that is

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.990 
the length of the shim and that is
dictated<00:03:44.900> by<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.079> length<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.889> back<00:03:46.099> the

saddle pad that you're using and not so
much<00:03:50.450> as<00:03:50.629> your<00:03:50.810> base<00:03:50.989> foam<00:03:51.349> because<00:03:51.739> in<00:03:52.340> any

much as your base foam because in any
case<00:03:53.659> you're<00:03:54.260> leveling<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.010> saddle<00:03:55.459> with

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
case you're leveling the saddle with

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.839 
case you're leveling the saddle with
this<00:03:55.879> shim<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:57.590> could<00:03:57.739> have<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:57.950> five<00:03:58.519> inch

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
this shim and you could have a five inch

this shim and you could have a five inch
thick<00:03:59.180> piece<00:03:59.419> of<00:03:59.659> foam<00:03:59.840> here<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:00.590> you're

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:01.219 
thick piece of foam here and you're

thick piece of foam here and you're
still<00:04:01.459> going<00:04:01.609> to<00:04:01.639> need<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.909> pick<00:04:02.209> up<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.389> front

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
a little bit to level it and what I went

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.189 
a little bit to level it and what I went
to<00:04:07.849> stress<00:04:08.150> yours<00:04:08.389> first<00:04:08.659> you're<00:04:08.930> noticing

to stress yours first you're noticing

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.890 
to stress yours first you're noticing
this<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:09.979> phone<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:11.060> notice<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.479> logo

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
this is the phone you notice the logo

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.430 
this is the phone you notice the logo
but<00:04:12.379> the<00:04:12.709> foam<00:04:13.010> chin<00:04:13.549> goes<00:04:13.819> underneath<00:04:14.510> not<00:04:15.229> on

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.670 
but the foam chin goes underneath not on
top<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.039> you'll<00:04:16.489> notice<00:04:16.699> bevels<00:04:17.449> here<00:04:17.900> here

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680

allow this this very thin chimp the
compression<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.479> compress<00:04:29.960> very

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
compression is going to compress very

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.409 
compression is going to compress very
easily<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.949> when<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.520> set<00:04:31.729> it<00:04:31.759> here<00:04:32.180> like

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
easily and when you set it here like

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.689 
easily and when you set it here like
this<00:04:32.659> it<00:04:32.960> looks<00:04:33.289> like<00:04:33.349> it's<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.620> big<00:04:33.800> thump<00:04:34.190> out

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
this it looks like it's a big thump out

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.089 
this it looks like it's a big thump out
but<00:04:35.030> once<00:04:35.389> it's<00:04:35.659> under<00:04:36.229> pressure<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.830> under

but once it's under pressure and under
heat<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.820> just<00:04:38.090> blends<00:04:38.570> right<00:04:39.050> into<00:04:39.409> this<00:04:39.740> this

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.410 
through all the gates all the leads left
and<00:05:19.690> right<00:05:19.870> then<00:05:20.500> do<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.740> lot<00:05:20.890> of<00:05:20.920> turns<00:05:21.280> back<00:05:22.210> it

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
and right then do a lot of turns back it

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.600 
and right then do a lot of turns back it
up<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.780> then<00:05:23.440> we'll<00:05:23.560> come<00:05:23.800> back<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.190> check<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
up and then we'll come back and check it

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.980 
up and then we'll come back and check it
and<00:05:24.820> then<00:05:25.240> we'll<00:05:25.390> make<00:05:25.510> any<00:05:25.720> final

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
and then we'll make any final

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.260 
and then we'll make any final
adjustments<00:05:26.230> like<00:05:26.800> Tom<00:05:27.100> said<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.520> might<00:05:27.670> be

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
adjustments like Tom said it might be

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.880 
adjustments like Tom said it might be
some<00:05:28.480> fine<00:05:28.720> adjustments<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.560> will<00:05:29.710> also

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
some fine adjustments and I will also

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.760 
some fine adjustments and I will also
use<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.580> thermal-imaging<00:05:31.330> camera<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.470> see<00:05:32.620> if<00:05:32.650> I

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
use a thermal-imaging camera to see if I

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.250 
use a thermal-imaging camera to see if I
have<00:05:32.950> any<00:05:32.980> specific<00:05:33.790> hot<00:05:34.270> spots<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:35.110> are

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
have any specific hot spots that are

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.010 
have any specific hot spots that are
warmer<00:05:35.770> than<00:05:36.090> other<00:05:37.090> spots<00:05:37.510> didn't<00:05:37.840> try<00:05:37.960> to

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
warmer than other spots didn't try to

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.440 
warmer than other spots didn't try to
determine<00:05:38.380> what's<00:05:38.890> causing<00:05:39.010> that<00:05:39.460> then<00:05:40.300> the

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
determine what's causing that then the

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.720 
determine what's causing that then the
second<00:05:40.840> time<00:05:41.050> we<00:05:41.530> go<00:05:41.680> out<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.830> test<00:05:42.130> well<00:05:42.700> I

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
second time we go out and test well I

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.670 
second time we go out and test well I
have<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.000> go<00:05:43.180> out<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.840> ranch<00:05:44.110> here<00:05:44.470> where

a half then we'll come back in and check
it<00:05:53.830> again<00:05:54.220> and<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:55.300> will<00:05:55.450> give<00:05:55.510> us<00:05:55.690> our<00:05:55.930> final

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
it again and that will give us our final

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.290 
it again and that will give us our final
determination<00:05:56.980> of<00:05:57.100> any<00:05:57.220> fine-tuning<00:05:57.820> we<00:05:58.090> need

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
determination of any fine-tuning we need

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.400 
determination of any fine-tuning we need
and<00:05:58.590> with<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.620> I<00:06:00.010> should<00:06:00.340> have<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:01.410> saddle
