today<00:00:01.110> we're<00:00:01.230> gonna<00:00:01.290> be<00:00:01.500> digging<00:00:01.770> up<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
today we're gonna be digging up the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.010 
today we're gonna be digging up the
sweet<00:00:02.429> potatoes<00:00:02.939> that<00:00:02.970> we<00:00:03.330> planted<00:00:03.750> earlier

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
sweet potatoes that we planted earlier

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.079 
sweet potatoes that we planted earlier
in<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> summer<00:00:04.410> one<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.520> reasons<00:00:05.910> that

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
in the summer one of the reasons that

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.059 
in the summer one of the reasons that
it's<00:00:06.390> today<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:07.170> come<00:00:07.319> down<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.770> is

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
it's today it's come down to that is

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.339 
it's today it's come down to that is
that<00:00:08.460> tomorrow<00:00:08.790> tonight<00:00:09.450> overnight<00:00:09.960> it

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
that tomorrow tonight overnight it

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.390 
that tomorrow tonight overnight it
should<00:00:10.559> go<00:00:10.740> down<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.950> 31<00:00:11.370> degrees<00:00:11.960> and<00:00:13.400> below

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
should go down to 31 degrees and below

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.150 
should go down to 31 degrees and below
freezing<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:15.540> understand<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.440> if<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
freezing we understand that if the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
freezing we understand that if the
temperatures<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:18.510> below<00:00:19.199> freezing<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
temperatures go below freezing and the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.939 
temperatures go below freezing and the
plant<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.180> above<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> ground<00:00:21.869> dies<00:00:22.410> as<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
plant that's above the ground dies as a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.099 
plant that's above the ground dies as a
result<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> will<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
result of it which it will then the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929 
result of it which it will then the
potatoes<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.099> are<00:00:26.189> below<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.430> ground<00:00:26.789> will

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
potatoes that are below the ground will

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.900 
potatoes that are below the ground will
very<00:00:27.180> quickly<00:00:27.390> rot<00:00:27.900> which<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.740> don't<00:00:28.920> want<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
very quickly rot which we don't want so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
very quickly rot which we don't want so
today's<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.599> day<00:00:30.900> we're<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> dig<00:00:31.470> up

potato<00:01:53.460> harvesting<00:01:54.030> I'll<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.420> digging<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
potato harvesting I'll be digging and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630 
potato harvesting I'll be digging and
scraping<00:01:55.440> around<00:01:55.530> I've<00:01:55.830> actually<00:01:56.010> washed<00:01:56.400> my

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
scraping around I've actually washed my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
scraping around I've actually washed my
hands<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.180> digging<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.470> out

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
hands that's digging to get these out

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.300 
hands that's digging to get these out
but<00:01:58.920> here's<00:01:59.310> our<00:01:59.550> our<00:01:59.970> haul<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> year

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
but here's our our haul for the year

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.850 
but here's our our haul for the year
it's<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.460> bad<00:02:03.140> considering<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.380> about<00:02:04.560> at

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it's not bad considering it's about at

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.380 
it's not bad considering it's about at
least<00:02:05.100> four<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.369> five<00:02:05.490> times<00:02:05.910> more<00:02:06.150> than<00:02:06.210> we

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
least four or five times more than we

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.380 
least four or five times more than we
had<00:02:06.540> last<00:02:06.720> year<00:02:07.130> we'd<00:02:08.130> like<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.610> for

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
had last year we'd like to have more for

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
had last year we'd like to have more for
productivity<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.170> we'll<00:02:10.350> probably<00:02:10.470> plant<00:02:11.040> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
productivity and we'll probably plant a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.220 
productivity and we'll probably plant a
larger<00:02:11.910> number<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.240> sweet<00:02:12.510> potatoes<00:02:12.930> next

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
larger number of sweet potatoes next

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.290 
larger number of sweet potatoes next
year<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.770> hopefully<00:02:14.700> we'll<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.150> better

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
year and hopefully we'll have better

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.740 
year and hopefully we'll have better
soil<00:02:15.800> or<00:02:16.800> at<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> end<00:02:17.340> stage<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:18.030> our<00:02:18.209> potato

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
soil or at the end stage of our potato

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.770 
soil or at the end stage of our potato
sweet<00:02:19.320> potato<00:02:19.440> storing<00:02:20.190> process<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.660> can

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
sweet potato storing process and you can

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.050 
sweet potato storing process and you can
see<00:02:21.989> these<00:02:22.140> potatoes<00:02:22.770> laid<00:02:23.010> out<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.459> that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
see these potatoes laid out here that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
see these potatoes laid out here that
have<00:02:24.239> been<00:02:24.270> curing<00:02:25.020> over<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> past<00:02:25.830> week<00:02:26.160> or

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
have been curing over the past week or

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.430 
have been curing over the past week or
so<00:02:26.480> probably<00:02:27.480> did<00:02:27.870> we'll<00:02:27.959> need<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.170> stagger

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
so probably did we'll need to stagger

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.750 
so probably did we'll need to stagger
quite<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.890> long<00:02:29.040> but<00:02:29.459> they<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.910> been<00:02:30.260> just

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
quite that long but they have been just

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.370 
quite that long but they have been just
not<00:02:32.760> touching<00:02:33.239> each<00:02:33.300> other<00:02:33.570> or<00:02:33.840> anything<00:02:34.080> else

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
not touching each other or anything else

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.880 
not touching each other or anything else
so<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:36.230> get<00:02:37.230> them<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.650> point

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so that we can get them to the point

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.520 
so that we can get them to the point
they<00:02:38.070> are<00:02:38.280> ready<00:02:38.459> for<00:02:38.550> storage<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.390> long<00:02:40.200> term

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
they are ready for storage for long term

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.740 
they are ready for storage for long term
I'd<00:02:40.739> say<00:02:40.890> several<00:02:41.340> months<00:02:41.670> possible<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.630> what

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
I'd say several months possible so what

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.320 
I'd say several months possible so what
we're<00:02:42.900> doing<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.170> we're<00:02:43.320> taking<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
we're doing is we're taking the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.550 
we're doing is we're taking the
unblemished<00:02:45.330> relatively<00:02:46.019> unblemished

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
unblemished relatively unblemished

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.070 
unblemished relatively unblemished
potatoes<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.250> putting<00:02:47.790> them<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.660> bottom

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
potatoes and putting them on the bottom

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.740 
potatoes and putting them on the bottom
the<00:02:49.230> ones<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.650> think<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.370> will<00:02:50.820> not<00:02:51.030> need<00:02:51.420> at

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the ones that I think I will not need at

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.340 
the ones that I think I will not need at
first<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.459> several<00:02:54.350> potatoes

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
first because we have several potatoes

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.070 
first because we have several potatoes
that<00:02:55.530> due<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.190> excess<00:02:57.030> water<00:02:57.360> toward<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> end

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
that due to excess water toward the end

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.160 
that due to excess water toward the end
of<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:59.239> growing<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.750> fruit<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.830> had<00:03:03.170> as

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
of the growing of this fruit we had as

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.289 
of the growing of this fruit we had as
you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.560> see<00:03:04.739> cracks<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.400> developed<00:03:05.850> so

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you can see cracks that developed so

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.240 
you can see cracks that developed so
hopefully<00:03:07.080> we<00:03:07.200> can<00:03:07.350> salvage<00:03:07.590> something<00:03:08.010> of

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
hopefully we can salvage something of

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.070 
hopefully we can salvage something of
this<00:03:08.340> potato<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.209> probably<00:03:09.630> needs<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.930> be

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
this potato but it probably needs to be

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.229 
this potato but it probably needs to be
eaten<00:03:10.380> first<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> I'll<00:03:11.940> put<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.299> layer<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
eaten first so I'll put the layer of the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.699 
eaten first so I'll put the layer of the
relatively<00:03:15.239> normal<00:03:15.720> potato<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
relatively normal potato this on the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.000 
relatively normal potato this on the
bottom<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:18.989> good<00:03:19.140> sized<00:03:19.440> ones<00:03:19.769> and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
bottom and you know good sized ones and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.220 
bottom and you know good sized ones and
then<00:03:20.160> I'll<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.489> stacking<00:03:21.360> all<00:03:21.510> these<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.930> top

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
then I'll be stacking all these on top

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.540 
then I'll be stacking all these on top
and<00:03:22.769> keeping<00:03:23.760> them<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:23.910> cool<00:03:24.150> storage
