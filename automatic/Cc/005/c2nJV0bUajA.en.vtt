although<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.409> sock<00:01:47.679> yarn<00:01:48.159> looks<00:01:48.369> really<00:01:48.909> cool

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119

when<00:01:49.329> it's<00:01:49.450> knitted<00:01:49.810> up<00:01:49.929> it's<00:01:50.679> kind<00:01:51.039> of<00:01:51.130> hard

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
when it's knitted up it's kind of hard

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.510

to<00:01:52.049> turn<00:01:53.049> it<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.349> because<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.830> color

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
to turn it it because the color

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.120 
to turn it it because the color
sequences<00:01:55.119> are<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.479> short<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:56.560> hard<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.920> tell

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
sequences are so short it's hard to tell

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.339
