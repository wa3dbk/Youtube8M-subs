whenever<00:00:03.830> I'm<00:00:04.010> walking<00:00:04.190> afield<00:00:04.700> I<00:00:04.910> like<00:00:05.210> to

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
whenever I'm walking afield I like to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.269 
whenever I'm walking afield I like to
have<00:00:05.629> my<00:00:05.870> tile<00:00:06.140> Spade<00:00:06.500> with<00:00:06.529> me<00:00:06.859> not<00:00:07.129> because

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
have my tile Spade with me not because

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.370 
have my tile Spade with me not because
I'm<00:00:07.520> gonna<00:00:07.640> do<00:00:07.819> tiling<00:00:08.300> necessarily<00:00:09.170> but

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
I'm gonna do tiling necessarily but

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.080 
I'm gonna do tiling necessarily but
because<00:00:09.440> I<00:00:09.920> like<00:00:10.190> to<00:00:10.340> stick<00:00:10.580> it<00:00:10.700> in<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:10.880> ground

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
because I like to stick it in the ground

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.450 
because I like to stick it in the ground
and<00:00:11.390> just<00:00:11.480> see<00:00:11.780> how<00:00:11.810> firm<00:00:12.290> that<00:00:12.620> soil<00:00:12.920> is<00:00:13.130> we're

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
and just see how firm that soil is we're

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.370 
and just see how firm that soil is we're
gonna<00:00:13.550> get<00:00:13.850> into<00:00:14.090> parts<00:00:14.360> of<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.570> field<00:00:14.810> where

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
gonna get into parts of the field where

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.020 
gonna get into parts of the field where
I<00:00:15.410> can<00:00:15.620> only<00:00:15.770> stick<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:16.250> shovel<00:00:16.610> in<00:00:16.700> just<00:00:16.910> a

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030 
I can only stick the shovel in just a

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.140 
I can only stick the shovel in just a
few<00:00:17.330> inches<00:00:17.570> maybe<00:00:18.020> two<00:00:18.530> to<00:00:18.830> four<00:00:19.100> inches

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
few inches maybe two to four inches

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.430 
few inches maybe two to four inches
we've<00:00:20.150> got<00:00:20.360> a<00:00:20.390> big<00:00:20.630> time<00:00:20.840> problem<00:00:21.290> with

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:21.440 
we've got a big time problem with

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.380 
we've got a big time problem with
compaction<00:00:22.310> there<00:00:22.550> that<00:00:22.940> needs<00:00:23.180> to<00:00:23.360> be

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
compaction there that needs to be

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.180 
compaction there that needs to be
addressed<00:00:23.660> yeah<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.380> whole<00:00:24.830> thing<00:00:25.039> with

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
addressed yeah the whole thing with

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.310 
addressed yeah the whole thing with
compaction<00:00:25.820> though<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.300> a<00:00:26.600> lot<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:26.930> farmers

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
compaction though is a lot of farmers

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.200 
compaction though is a lot of farmers
will<00:00:27.590> say<00:00:27.800> oh<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:28.039> know<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.520> got<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.850> little<00:00:29.000> bit

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
will say oh you know I got a little bit

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.880 
will say oh you know I got a little bit
of<00:00:29.300> compaction<00:00:29.600> but<00:00:29.869> it's<00:00:30.050> no<00:00:30.230> big<00:00:30.530> deal

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
of compaction but it's no big deal

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.550 
of compaction but it's no big deal
most<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:31.970> us<00:00:32.060> just<00:00:32.119> don't<00:00:32.630> realize<00:00:33.140> how<00:00:33.170> bad

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
most of us just don't realize how bad

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.229 
most of us just don't realize how bad
the<00:00:33.770> compaction<00:00:34.100> problem<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:34.670> that's<00:00:34.910> why<00:00:35.120> in

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
the compaction problem is that's why in

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.150 
the compaction problem is that's why in
our<00:00:35.360> farm<00:00:35.630> we<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.079> big<00:00:36.230> root<00:00:36.590> pits<00:00:36.860> when

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
our farm we like the big root pits when

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.950 
our farm we like the big root pits when
we<00:00:37.340> go<00:00:37.400> out<00:00:37.579> in<00:00:37.700> big<00:00:37.850> rip<00:00:38.090> pits<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:38.510> can<00:00:38.690> see

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
we go out in big rip pits you can see

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.260 
we go out in big rip pits you can see
exactly<00:00:39.530> where<00:00:39.890> root<00:00:40.130> growth<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.610> we<00:00:40.880> suggest

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
exactly where root growth is we suggest

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.850 
exactly where root growth is we suggest
fitting<00:00:41.570> rip<00:00:41.720> pits<00:00:41.930> especially<00:00:42.380> at<00:00:42.470> this<00:00:42.620> time

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
fitting rip pits especially at this time

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.799 
fitting rip pits especially at this time
of<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.040> year<00:00:43.190> right<00:00:43.430> now<00:00:43.489> because<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.540> roots

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
of the year right now because the roots

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.510 
of the year right now because the roots
on<00:00:45.079> most<00:00:45.380> crops<00:00:45.710> have<00:00:45.920> been<00:00:45.950> fully<00:00:46.340> developed

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
on most crops have been fully developed

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.760 
on most crops have been fully developed
and<00:00:47.000> for<00:00:47.360> that<00:00:47.450> matter<00:00:47.660> maybe<00:00:48.350> they're<00:00:48.590> more

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
and for that matter maybe they're more

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.830 
and for that matter maybe they're more
than<00:00:49.040> fully<00:00:49.250> developed<00:00:49.730> like<00:00:49.910> with<00:00:50.149> corn<00:00:50.480> it

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
than fully developed like with corn it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.810 
than fully developed like with corn it
reaches<00:00:51.200> maximum<00:00:51.620> rat<00:00:51.950> size<00:00:52.219> at<00:00:52.610> about

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
reaches maximum rat size at about

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.670 
reaches maximum rat size at about
tasseling<00:00:53.360> time<00:00:53.600> but<00:00:53.840> anyway<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.260> point<00:00:54.290> is

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
tasseling time but anyway the point is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.590 
tasseling time but anyway the point is
you<00:00:54.950> can<00:00:55.100> see<00:00:55.370> where<00:00:55.640> all<00:00:55.850> your<00:00:56.059> roots<00:00:56.270> are<00:00:56.420> at

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
you can see where all your roots are at

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.450 
you can see where all your roots are at
so<00:00:56.899> if<00:00:56.989> you've<00:00:57.110> had<00:00:57.140> major<00:00:57.620> compaction<00:00:58.340> issues

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
so if you've had major compaction issues

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.250 
so if you've had major compaction issues
you'll<00:00:59.000> have<00:00:59.180> most<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.510> your<00:00:59.600> corn<00:00:59.840> roots<00:01:00.050> or

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
you'll have most of your corn roots or

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.560 
you'll have most of your corn roots or
any<00:01:00.680> crops<00:01:01.100> roots<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.730> top<00:01:01.910> few<00:01:02.180> inches<00:01:02.329> of

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
any crops roots in the top few inches of

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.689 
any crops roots in the top few inches of
soil<00:01:02.780> rather<00:01:03.230> than<00:01:03.469> reaching<00:01:03.710> down<00:01:04.100> where

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
soil rather than reaching down where

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.120 
soil rather than reaching down where
they<00:01:04.909> need<00:01:05.179> to<00:01:05.209> be<00:01:05.389> down<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:05.869> foot<00:01:06.439> two<00:01:06.859> feet

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
they need to be down a foot two feet

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.800 
they need to be down a foot two feet
three<00:01:07.189> feet<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.789> the<00:01:07.880> ground<00:01:08.090> there's<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.569> lot

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
three feet in the ground there's a lot

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.209 
three feet in the ground there's a lot
of<00:01:08.929> different<00:01:09.200> things<00:01:09.350> with<00:01:09.530> compaction<00:01:10.069> it

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
of different things with compaction it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.279 
of different things with compaction it
can<00:01:10.609> be<00:01:10.700> an<00:01:10.789> issue<00:01:10.909> when<00:01:11.090> you're<00:01:11.329> too<00:01:11.509> dry<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
can be an issue when you're too dry it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.020 
can be an issue when you're too dry it
can<00:01:12.439> also<00:01:12.590> be<00:01:12.859> an<00:01:12.950> issue<00:01:13.069> when<00:01:13.369> you're<00:01:13.490> too<00:01:13.729> wet

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
can also be an issue when you're too wet

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.120 
can also be an issue when you're too wet
when<00:01:14.359> you've<00:01:14.479> got<00:01:14.689> lots<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.259> moisture<00:01:15.469> in<00:01:15.889> fact

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
when you've got lots of moisture in fact

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.370 
when you've got lots of moisture in fact
excessive<00:01:16.909> moisture<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.810> need<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.170> water

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
excessive moisture you need that water

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.349 
excessive moisture you need that water
to<00:01:18.619> move<00:01:18.770> down<00:01:19.039> through<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.549> soil<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:20.060> get<00:01:20.179> rid

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
to move down through the soil to get rid

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.029 
to move down through the soil to get rid
of<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:20.630> don't<00:01:20.749> want<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.049> just<00:01:21.109> washing<00:01:21.859> off

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
of it you don't want it just washing off

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.309 
of it you don't want it just washing off
in<00:01:22.340> any<00:01:22.639> roading<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.329> topsoil<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.109> want<00:01:24.259> it

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
in any roading the topsoil you want it

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.899 
in any roading the topsoil you want it
to<00:01:24.409> move<00:01:24.529> down<00:01:24.590> through<00:01:25.009> if<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.670> get<00:01:25.880> a

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
to move down through if you get a

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.969 
to move down through if you get a
compaction<00:01:26.329> layer<00:01:26.539> that<00:01:26.899> water<00:01:27.139> cannot<00:01:27.709> get

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
compaction layer that water cannot get

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.440 
compaction layer that water cannot get
through<00:01:28.279> yeah<00:01:28.490> but<00:01:28.639> the<00:01:28.759> thing<00:01:28.969> is<00:01:28.999> when<00:01:29.359> you

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
through yeah but the thing is when you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.849 
through yeah but the thing is when you
have<00:01:29.659> moisture<00:01:29.929> then<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.709> little

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
have moisture then it's a little

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.469 
have moisture then it's a little
misleading<00:01:31.099> you<00:01:31.609> don't<00:01:31.819> think<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.149> have<00:01:32.329> as

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
misleading you don't think you have as

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.449 
misleading you don't think you have as
bad<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.689> compaction<00:01:33.109> problem<00:01:33.590> because<00:01:33.859> you

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
bad a compaction problem because you

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:35.919 
bad a compaction problem because you
still<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> pretty<00:01:35.149> good<00:01:35.389> crop<00:01:35.569> even<00:01:35.749> if

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
still have a pretty good crop even if

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.330 
still have a pretty good crop even if
let's<00:01:36.139> put<00:01:36.319> it<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:36.439> way<00:01:36.560> even<00:01:36.679> if<00:01:36.979> all<00:01:37.159> your

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
let's put it this way even if all your

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.190 
let's put it this way even if all your
roots<00:01:37.520> are<00:01:37.579> in<00:01:37.639> the<00:01:37.729> top<00:01:37.969> four<00:01:38.420> inches<00:01:38.779> of<00:01:38.990> soil

roots are in the top four inches of soil

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.839 
roots are in the top four inches of soil
if<00:01:39.469> you<00:01:39.590> have<00:01:39.679> decent<00:01:40.069> moisture<00:01:40.159> all<00:01:40.490> season

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:40.849 
if you have decent moisture all season

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.019 
if you have decent moisture all season
long<00:01:40.969> your<00:01:41.179> crop<00:01:41.389> new<00:01:41.659> turns<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:42.109> can<00:01:42.139> Ram<00:01:42.889> a

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
long your crop new turns you can Ram a

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:45.489 
long your crop new turns you can Ram a
penetrator<00:01:44.029> through<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:44.929> you're<00:01:45.229> still

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
penetrator through it but you're still

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.499 
penetrator through it but you're still
going<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:45.889> see<00:01:46.099> that<00:01:46.249> layer<00:01:46.490> show<00:01:46.849> up<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.270> some

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
going to see that layer show up to some

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.169 
going to see that layer show up to some
to<00:01:47.719> some<00:01:47.959> degree<00:01:48.289> but<00:01:48.679> if<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.399> soil<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:49.939> wet

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
to some degree but if that soil is wet

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.109 
to some degree but if that soil is wet
your<00:01:50.479> roots<00:01:50.689> are<00:01:50.810> more<00:01:51.380> likely<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:52.279> penetrate

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
your roots are more likely to penetrate

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.059 
your roots are more likely to penetrate
through<00:01:53.359> actually<00:01:54.049> I'll<00:01:54.139> agree<00:01:54.409> with<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> and

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
through actually I'll agree with you and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.620 
through actually I'll agree with you and
I've<00:01:55.249> got<00:01:55.459> a<00:01:55.490> good<00:01:55.669> example<00:01:55.999> of<00:01:56.149> that<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:56.359> was<00:01:56.509> in

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
I've got a good example of that I was in

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.389 
I've got a good example of that I was in
western<00:01:57.049> New<00:01:57.169> York<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.560> few<00:01:57.770> weeks<00:01:57.950> ago<00:01:58.130> and

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
western New York a few weeks ago and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.129 
western New York a few weeks ago and
they've<00:01:58.549> had<00:01:58.729> excessive<00:01:59.419> moisture<00:01:59.630> through

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
they've had excessive moisture through

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.109 
they've had excessive moisture through
the<00:02:00.259> growing<00:02:00.469> season<00:02:00.619> there<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.399> actually<00:02:01.789> in

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the growing season there and actually in

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.760 
the growing season there and actually in
rip<00:02:02.389> pits<00:02:02.599> you<00:02:02.779> could<00:02:02.959> see<00:02:03.169> it<00:02:03.319> where<00:02:03.560> there

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
rip pits you could see it where there

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.039 
rip pits you could see it where there
was<00:02:04.039> zone<00:02:04.579> building<00:02:05.119> farmers<00:02:05.659> who<00:02:05.779> had<00:02:05.899> done

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
was zone building farmers who had done

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.569 
was zone building farmers who had done
some<00:02:06.349> zone<00:02:06.560> bo<00:02:06.739> and<00:02:06.889> they<00:02:06.950> said<00:02:07.130> man<00:02:07.249> the<00:02:07.399> roots

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
some zone bo and they said man the roots

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.700 
some zone bo and they said man the roots
went<00:02:07.819> right<00:02:07.999> down<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.600> moisture<00:02:09.259> went<00:02:09.470> down

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
went right down the moisture went down

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.500 
went right down the moisture went down
it<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:10.009> fantastic<00:02:10.729> for<00:02:10.910> us<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> really<00:02:11.150> stood

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
it was fantastic for us it really stood

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.870 
it was fantastic for us it really stood
out<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.780> field<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.380> where<00:02:12.530> we

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
out in the field but where we

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.910 
out in the field but where we
I hadn't<00:02:13.180> run<00:02:13.420> zone<00:02:13.750> builders<00:02:14.170> out<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:14.650> we

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I hadn't run zone builders out there we

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.620 
I hadn't run zone builders out there we
had<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.280> compaction<00:02:15.700> layer<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.330> roots

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
had that compaction layer and the roots

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.380 
had that compaction layer and the roots
eventually<00:02:17.470> did<00:02:17.860> kind<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.610> wiggle<00:02:19.090> their<00:02:19.360> way

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
eventually did kind of wiggle their way

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.420 
eventually did kind of wiggle their way
through<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.590> took<00:02:20.710> them<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.950> lot<00:02:21.190> longer

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
through it but it took them a lot longer

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.910 
through it but it took them a lot longer
the<00:02:22.000> crap<00:02:22.270> suffered<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.050> yes<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.500> did<00:02:23.650> hold

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the crap suffered and yes it did hold

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.620 
the crap suffered and yes it did hold
back<00:02:24.220> some<00:02:24.520> moisture<00:02:24.880> there's<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.240> question

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
back some moisture there's no question

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.940 
back some moisture there's no question
about<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> okay<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.320> mentioned<00:02:26.500> zone

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
about it okay you mentioned zone

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.140 
about it okay you mentioned zone
building<00:02:27.370> why<00:02:27.520> don't<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.730> talk<00:02:27.880> about<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
building why don't you talk about the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.800 
building why don't you talk about the
specifics<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:30.130> how<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.810> remedy

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
specifics of that in how to remedy

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.240 
specifics of that in how to remedy
compaction<00:02:32.500> at<00:02:32.620> least<00:02:32.800> in<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.950> short<00:02:33.190> term

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
compaction at least in the short term

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.320 
compaction at least in the short term
okay<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:33.730> there's<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.970> couple<00:02:34.150> different

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
okay well there's a couple different

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330 
okay well there's a couple different
ways<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.830> take<00:02:36.100> care<00:02:36.280> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
ways that you can can take care of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.240 
ways that you can can take care of
compaction<00:02:36.880> now<00:02:37.240> one<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.660> them<00:02:37.930> would<00:02:38.200> be

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
compaction now one of them would be

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
compaction now one of them would be
using<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.340> zone<00:02:39.550> builder<00:02:39.880> that's<00:02:40.060> our

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
using a zone builder that's our

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.090 
using a zone builder that's our
preferred<00:02:40.750> method<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.320> our<00:02:41.350> from<00:02:41.740> what<00:02:41.950> we're

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
preferred method on our from what we're

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.590 
preferred method on our from what we're
talking<00:02:42.460> about<00:02:42.490> with<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.880> zone<00:02:43.090> builder<00:02:43.450> is

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
talking about with the zone builder is

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.540 
talking about with the zone builder is
using<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.020> straight<00:02:44.380> shank<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:45.070> our<00:02:45.280> farm

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
using a straight shank in our farm

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.270 
using a straight shank in our farm
30-inch<00:02:46.150> spacings<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.470> shanks<00:02:47.830> just<00:02:48.100> a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
30-inch spacings and that shanks just a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.100 
30-inch spacings and that shanks just a
couple<00:02:48.520> inches<00:02:48.760> wide<00:02:49.120> at<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.480> bottom<00:02:49.630> at<00:02:49.990> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
couple inches wide at the bottom at the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.800 
couple inches wide at the bottom at the
tip<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.710> not<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.190> big<00:02:51.250> wide<00:02:51.850> shank<00:02:52.660> we

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
tip so it's not this big wide shank we

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.510 
tip so it's not this big wide shank we
aren't<00:02:52.990> trying<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> turn<00:02:53.680> over<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.980> lot<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.280> soil

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
aren't trying to turn over a lot of soil

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.280 
aren't trying to turn over a lot of soil
we're<00:02:54.850> just<00:02:54.970> trying<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.270> slice<00:02:55.720> through<00:02:56.140> that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
we're just trying to slice through that

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.380 
we're just trying to slice through that
compaction<00:02:57.070> layer<00:02:57.100> basically<00:02:57.940> leaving<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
compaction layer basically leaving the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.390 
compaction layer basically leaving the
topsoil<00:02:58.900> for<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.380> most<00:02:59.560> part<00:02:59.800> undisturbed

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
topsoil for the most part undisturbed

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.180 
topsoil for the most part undisturbed
but<00:03:00.700> we're<00:03:00.850> slicing<00:03:01.180> slots<00:03:02.050> down<00:03:02.740> through

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
but we're slicing slots down through

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.070 
but we're slicing slots down through
that<00:03:03.340> compacted<00:03:03.970> layer<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.330> roots<00:03:04.600> will<00:03:04.780> find

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
that compacted layer so roots will find

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.560 
that compacted layer so roots will find
those<00:03:05.320> slots<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.950> also<00:03:06.730> moisture<00:03:07.210> will<00:03:07.360> find

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
those slots and also moisture will find

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.750 
those slots and also moisture will find
those<00:03:07.750> slots<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.260> move<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.620> down<00:03:08.890> getting<00:03:09.610> us

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
those slots and move on down getting us

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.640 
those slots and move on down getting us
down<00:03:10.030> below<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.630> compaction<00:03:11.050> layer<00:03:11.320> or<00:03:11.500> we

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
down below that compaction layer or we

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.890 
down below that compaction layer or we
can<00:03:11.800> access<00:03:11.980> water<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.820> neutrons<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.750> whole

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
can access water and neutrons the whole

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.720 
can access water and neutrons the whole
in<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.080> way<00:03:14.170> with<00:03:14.320> exit<00:03:14.680> or<00:03:14.860> get<00:03:15.040> away<00:03:15.220> get<00:03:15.520> rid

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
typically have to compaction layers on

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.240 
typically have to compaction layers on
most<00:03:19.780> farms<00:03:20.170> across<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.620> entire<00:03:20.920> country

most farms across the entire country
just<00:03:21.610> about<00:03:21.790> every<00:03:22.000> field<00:03:22.270> Darin<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.960> have

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
ever been in on I'm just three other

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.820 
ever been in on I'm just three other
countries<00:03:25.630> as<00:03:25.780> well<00:03:25.960> but<00:03:26.440> we<00:03:26.590> find<00:03:26.770> a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
countries as well but we find a

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.340 
countries as well but we find a
compaction<00:03:27.190> layer<00:03:27.490> at<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.880> plow<00:03:28.540> pan<00:03:28.900> say

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
compaction layer at the plow pan say

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.170 
compaction layer at the plow pan say
eight<00:03:29.710> inches<00:03:30.040> deep<00:03:30.250> or<00:03:30.460> maybe<00:03:30.640> 10<00:03:30.880> inches

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
eight inches deep or maybe 10 inches

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.580 
eight inches deep or maybe 10 inches
deep<00:03:31.210> oh<00:03:31.510> every<00:03:31.750> deep<00:03:31.870> you've<00:03:32.050> done<00:03:32.230> pillage

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
deep oh every deep you've done pillage

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.500 
deep oh every deep you've done pillage
and<00:03:32.710> then<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.100> natural<00:03:33.610> compaction<00:03:34.120> layer<00:03:34.150> a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
and then a natural compaction layer a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.810 
and then a natural compaction layer a
lot<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.930> times<00:03:35.140> down<00:03:35.410> at<00:03:35.590> 16<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.280> 20<00:03:36.580> inches

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
lot of times down at 16 to 20 inches

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.070 
lot of times down at 16 to 20 inches
deep<00:03:37.030> with<00:03:37.240> this<00:03:37.390> zone<00:03:37.570> builder<00:03:37.900> we're

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
deep with this zone builder we're

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.620 
deep with this zone builder we're
running<00:03:38.350> down<00:03:38.500> about<00:03:38.920> 20<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.610> 22<00:03:40.090> inches<00:03:40.300> deep

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
running down about 20 to 22 inches deep

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.510 
running down about 20 to 22 inches deep
so<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.200> not<00:03:41.500> only<00:03:41.530> get<00:03:41.920> below<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.310> first

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
so we can not only get below the first

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.070 
so we can not only get below the first
compaction<00:03:43.060> layer<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.420> also<00:03:43.570> below<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
compaction layer but also below the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.050 
compaction layer but also below the
second<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:44.709> you're<00:03:45.070> right<00:03:45.280> away<00:03:45.520> you'll<00:03:45.880> say

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
second so you're right away you'll say

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.910 
second so you're right away you'll say
okay<00:03:46.420> I'm<00:03:46.510> getting<00:03:47.020> a<00:03:47.170> lot<00:03:47.320> more<00:03:47.350> roots<00:03:47.709> down

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
okay I'm getting a lot more roots down

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.500 
okay I'm getting a lot more roots down
there<00:03:48.130> do<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.490> always<00:03:48.760> have<00:03:48.880> more<00:03:49.240> yield

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
there do I always have more yield

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.850 
there do I always have more yield
because<00:03:49.720> they<00:03:49.930> have<00:03:50.020> more<00:03:50.140> roots<00:03:50.440> down<00:03:50.620> deep

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
because they have more roots down deep

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.530 
because they have more roots down deep
in<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.010> ground<00:03:51.190> well<00:03:51.490> not<00:03:51.640> necessarily<00:03:51.850> no

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
in the ground well not necessarily no

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.410 
in the ground well not necessarily no
more<00:03:53.230> roots<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.709> good<00:03:54.010> if<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.400> ask<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:55.120> hundred

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
more roots is good if you ask a hundred

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.240 
more roots is good if you ask a hundred
farmers<00:03:55.840> well<00:03:56.350> would<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.709> rather<00:03:56.740> have<00:03:57.040> more

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
farmers well would you rather have more

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.980 
farmers well would you rather have more
roots<00:03:57.520> or<00:03:57.700> less<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.240> think<00:03:58.660> you're<00:03:58.780> going<00:03:58.900> to

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
roots or less I think you're going to

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.830 
roots or less I think you're going to
get<00:03:59.050> probably<00:03:59.530> 98<00:04:00.100> or<00:04:00.370> 99<00:04:00.820> responses<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.600> yes

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
get probably 98 or 99 responses of yes

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
get probably 98 or 99 responses of yes
I'll<00:04:02.110> take<00:04:02.350> more<00:04:02.560> roots<00:04:02.830> every<00:04:03.130> time<00:04:03.340> but

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
I'll take more roots every time but

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.160 
I'll take more roots every time but
you've<00:04:03.910> got<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.240> have<00:04:04.330> some<00:04:04.510> nutrition<00:04:05.050> down

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
you've got to have some nutrition down

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.600 
you've got to have some nutrition down
there<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.440> feed<00:04:05.620> them<00:04:05.800> as<00:04:05.950> well<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:06.310> just

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
there to feed them as well so just

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.250 
there to feed them as well so just
because<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:07.000> have<00:04:07.030> bigger<00:04:07.480> roots<00:04:07.840> if<00:04:08.020> your

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
because you have bigger roots if your

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.350 
because you have bigger roots if your
fertility<00:04:08.560> program<00:04:09.100> isn't<00:04:09.340> there<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:09.910> support

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
fertility program isn't there to support

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.120 
fertility program isn't there to support
that<00:04:10.570> better<00:04:10.840> plant<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.500> aren't<00:04:11.680> necessarily

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
that better plant you aren't necessarily

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.470 
that better plant you aren't necessarily
going<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.459> have<00:04:12.610> better<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:12.910> other<00:04:13.030> words<00:04:13.300> in

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
going to have better in other words in

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360 
going to have better in other words in
the<00:04:13.570> short<00:04:13.840> term<00:04:14.080> you're<00:04:14.260> better<00:04:14.470> off<00:04:14.560> if<00:04:15.040> when

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
the short term you're better off if when

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.710 
the short term you're better off if when
your<00:04:15.520> zone<00:04:15.760> building<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.270> can<00:04:16.390> put<00:04:16.570> some

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
your zone building you can put some

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.300 
your zone building you can put some
fertility<00:04:16.989> down<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.770> we've<00:04:17.950> had<00:04:17.980> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
fertility down with it we've had the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.190 
fertility down with it we've had the
very<00:04:18.549> best<00:04:18.670> results<00:04:19.299> by<00:04:19.450> putting<00:04:19.810> liquid

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
very best results by putting liquid

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.040 
very best results by putting liquid
manure<00:04:20.590> down<00:04:20.979> into<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:22.000> slot<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.630> literally

ways to deal with compaction we like the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.950 
ways to deal with compaction we like the
deep<00:04:54.760> zone<00:04:55.000> building<00:04:55.449> with<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.690> straight

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
like right behind us we've got a chisel

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.340 
like right behind us we've got a chisel
plow<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.850> we<00:05:04.000> have<00:05:04.210> used<00:05:04.539> that<00:05:04.720> trying<00:05:05.139> to<00:05:05.169> run

Ripper or whatever you want to use

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.360

you're<00:05:23.350> eventually<00:05:23.530> going<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.039> see<00:05:24.190> that

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
you're eventually going to see that

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.310 
you're eventually going to see that
compaction<00:05:24.760> build<00:05:25.150> up<00:05:25.360> at<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.750> 12<00:05:26.080> inch

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
compaction build up at that 12 inch

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.320 
compaction build up at that 12 inch
level<00:05:26.560> now<00:05:26.860> rather<00:05:27.310> than<00:05:27.460> at<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.910> six<00:05:28.180> or

eight inch level that it once was so by

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.190 
eight inch level that it once was so by

doing that tillage where you're turning

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.810 
doing that tillage where you're turning
everything<00:05:32.440> over<00:05:32.740> you're<00:05:33.220> eventually<00:05:33.430> going

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
everything over you're eventually going

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.460 
everything over you're eventually going
to<00:05:33.910> create<00:05:34.210> compaction<00:05:34.810> again<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:35.200> it's<00:05:35.349> a

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
to create compaction again so it's a

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.500 
to create compaction again so it's a
shorter<00:05:35.919> term<00:05:36.160> fix<00:05:36.520> than<00:05:36.910> using<00:05:37.300> something

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
shorter term fix than using something

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.850 
shorter term fix than using something
like<00:05:37.630> a<00:05:37.780> zone<00:05:38.050> building<00:05:38.380> well<00:05:38.530> once<00:05:38.740> again

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
like a zone building well once again

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.100 
like a zone building well once again
compaction<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.669> major<00:05:39.970> issue<00:05:40.270> on<00:05:40.450> farms<00:05:40.870> all
