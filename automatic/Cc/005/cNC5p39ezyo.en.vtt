now you've seen the fuel in action let's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.310 
now you've seen the fuel in action let's
say<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.270> about<00:02:51.420> who<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:52.020> our

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
say a little bit about who we are our
