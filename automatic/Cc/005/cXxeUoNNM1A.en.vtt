okay so what we have here is the

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay so what we have here is the
crossfader<00:00:03.120> which<00:00:03.480> now<00:00:03.799> isn't<00:00:04.799> mapped<00:00:05.040> this

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
crossfader which now isn't mapped this

didn't<00:00:34.079> map<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> crossfader<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.280> DJ<00:00:35.700> goons

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
didn't map the crossfader but DJ goons

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.510 
didn't map the crossfader but DJ goons
he<00:00:36.270> did<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.870> mapped<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.800> well<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.430> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
he did so I I mapped it as well as you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.369 
he did so I I mapped it as well as you
can<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> screen<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
can see here on the screen you can see

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.600 
can see here on the screen you can see
it<00:00:40.590> move<00:00:40.770> back<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> forth<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:43.399> it<00:00:44.399> works

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it move back and forth and it works

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.080 
it move back and forth and it works
great<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.829> also<00:00:46.829> they<00:00:47.340> scratching<00:00:47.700> was

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
great you know also they scratching was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
great you know also they scratching was
not<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.980> an<00:00:49.980> option<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:51.649> Tim's<00:00:58.399> at<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> greatest

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
not a an option in Tim's at the greatest

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
not a an option in Tim's at the greatest
for<00:01:00.120> scratching<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> know<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
for scratching you know because this is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.529 
for scratching you know because this is
a<00:01:01.379> small<00:01:01.649> wheel<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.129> anyway<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> song

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
a small wheel but anyway when the song

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.550 
a small wheel but anyway when the song
is<00:01:03.660> playing<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.710> push<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:06.560> pitch

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is playing if you push down on the pitch

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.280 
is playing if you push down on the pitch
rotary<00:01:08.369> encoder<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.630> grab<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
rotary encoder you can then grab the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320 
rotary encoder you can then grab the
wheel<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> start<00:01:11.400> scratching<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.150> let

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
wheel and start scratching you can let

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
wheel and start scratching you can let
go<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> encoder<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:13.950> work<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
go of the encoder and then work the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.960 
go of the encoder and then work the
crossfader

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
crossfader

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510 
crossfader
which<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> pretty<00:01:16.140> neat<00:01:16.380> concept<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
which is a pretty neat concept I like a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.950 
which is a pretty neat concept I like a
lot<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> gives<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.689> pitch

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
lot so that gives the you know pitch

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
lot so that gives the you know pitch
rotary<00:01:22.320> encoder<00:01:22.740> three<00:01:23.430> effects<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
rotary encoder three effects because you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
rotary encoder three effects because you
know<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.540> turn<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.560> moves<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> pitch

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
know if you turn it it moves the pitch

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
know if you turn it it moves the pitch
ever<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> slow<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> push

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
ever so slow you know and if you push

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.990 
ever so slow you know and if you push
down<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.829> an<00:01:29.070> attorney<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.460> moves<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> lot

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
down on an attorney that moves it a lot

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.280 
down on an attorney that moves it a lot
faster<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> red<00:01:31.079> line

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
faster as you can see the red line

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.010 
faster as you can see the red line
moving<00:01:32.119> however<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.570> push<00:01:33.780> down<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
moving however if you just push down on

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.420 
moving however if you just push down on
it<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.350> don't<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.650> anything<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> doesn't<00:01:35.250> do

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it and don't do anything it doesn't do

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
it and don't do anything it doesn't do
anything<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.600> push<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
anything if you push down on it and you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
anything if you push down on it and you
grab<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> jog<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> called<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> modifier

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
grab the jog this is called the modifier

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.499 
grab the jog this is called the modifier
this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> map<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.329> push

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this is what we use to map this you push

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.480 
this is what we use to map this you push
down<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:43.890> grab<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> wheel

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
down on this you can then grab the wheel

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
down on this you can then grab the wheel
and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> scratch<00:01:45.509> away<00:01:45.689> while<00:01:46.200> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and you can scratch away while it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.350 
and you can scratch away while it's
playing<00:01:46.740> say<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.880> playing<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
playing say when it's not playing you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
playing say when it's not playing you
wear<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.810> scratch<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.189> guess<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.399> can

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
wear the scratch which I guess you can

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.370 
wear the scratch which I guess you can
probably<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> same<00:01:51.360> effect<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
probably get the same effect as if you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.899 
probably get the same effect as if you
were<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> hit<00:01:52.680> pause<00:01:52.950> scratch<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> little<00:01:53.759> bit

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
were to hit pause scratch a little bit

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
were to hit pause scratch a little bit
then<00:01:54.060> hit<00:01:54.210> play<00:01:54.390> again<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:55.290> probably<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
then hit play again it's probably the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
then hit play again it's probably the
same<00:01:55.920> thing<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.790> holding<00:01:57.119> down<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
same thing as just holding down the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
same thing as just holding down the
rotary<00:01:57.630> encoder<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> wasn't<00:01:59.310> mapped<00:01:59.490> like

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
rotary encoder but it wasn't mapped like

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.850 
rotary encoder but it wasn't mapped like
that<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> changed<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> mapping<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.740> what

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that so I changed the mapping then what

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.560 
that so I changed the mapping then what
we<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.880> effects<00:02:03.240> we

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
we have here is we have the effects we

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.030 
we have here is we have the effects we
have<00:02:03.600> three<00:02:03.960> different<00:02:04.170> knobs<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.740> effects

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
have three different knobs for effects

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240 
have three different knobs for effects
and<00:02:05.310> three<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:06.000> buttons

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and three different buttons

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.280 
and three different buttons
and<00:02:07.340> what<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:07.820> did<00:02:08.090> was<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.509> mapped<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.960> so<00:02:09.140> when

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
and what I did was I mapped it so when

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.950 
and what I did was I mapped it so when
you<00:02:09.380> turned<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:10.369> button<00:02:10.670> all<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
you turned the one button all the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.270 
you turned the one button all the
effects<00:02:12.290> come<00:02:12.500> on<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.800> all<00:02:12.890> three<00:02:13.130> lights

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
effects come on see all three lights

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.100 
effects come on see all three lights
come<00:02:13.520> on<00:02:13.580> there<00:02:13.730> one<00:02:13.850> two<00:02:13.970> three<00:02:14.270> one<00:02:15.080> two

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
come on there one two three one two

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.020 
come on there one two three one two
three<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.890> if<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.250> look<00:02:16.370> at<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.580> screen<00:02:16.850> not

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
three and if you look at the screen not

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.460 
three and if you look at the screen not
only<00:02:17.240> do<00:02:17.330> they<00:02:17.420> come<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.110> they<00:02:18.230> actually

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
only do they come on but they actually

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.760 
only do they come on but they actually
climb<00:02:19.100> up<00:02:19.340> very<00:02:19.610> fast<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.290> by<00:02:21.290> turning<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
climb up very fast just by turning the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.690 
climb up very fast just by turning the
knob<00:02:21.950> they're<00:02:22.880> on<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.390> they're<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.430> up

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
knob they're on and they're up on and up

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.720 
knob they're on and they're up on and up
and<00:02:26.120> then<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.140> second<00:02:27.500> knob<00:02:27.680> does<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> same

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and then the second knob does the same

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.820 
and then the second knob does the same
thing<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.660> has<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.840> whole<00:02:30.080> different<00:02:30.530> grouping

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
thing it has a whole different grouping

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.100 
thing it has a whole different grouping
of<00:02:30.950> effects<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.640> look<00:02:31.850> you'll<00:02:32.780> see<00:02:32.990> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
of effects if you look you'll see the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.260 
of effects if you look you'll see the
ice<00:02:33.260> verb<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.160> boom<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.150> ice

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
ice verb and a boom it's not the ice

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.860

three you know for number three I got my

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.330 
three you know for number three I got my
beat<00:02:52.310> masher<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.760> believe<00:02:53.030> said<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.300> this<00:02:53.390> one

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
beat masher I believe said to this one

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.760 
beat masher I believe said to this one
yes<00:02:55.340> which<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> beat<00:02:55.880> measure<00:02:56.090> comes<00:02:56.450> up<00:02:56.770> on

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
yes which the beat measure comes up on

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.690 
yes which the beat measure comes up on
and<00:02:58.190> up<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.570> up<00:02:59.870> which<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:00.980> pretty<00:03:01.459> cool

itch 3.0 they decided to come out with
DJ<00:03:32.420> intro<00:03:32.660> which<00:03:33.110> is<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.500> half<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:34.010> what<00:03:34.070> it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
DJ intro which is like half of what it

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.110 
DJ intro which is like half of what it
was<00:03:34.730> which<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.110> garbage<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.380> first<00:03:36.620> place

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
was which is garbage in the first place

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.500 
was which is garbage in the first place
for<00:03:38.120> cheap<00:03:38.680> $100<00:03:39.680> controller<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:40.519> those<00:03:41.480> of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
for cheap $100 controller so those of

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.630 
for cheap $100 controller so those of
you<00:03:41.750> who<00:03:41.780> own<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.380> zone<00:03:42.590> DX<00:03:42.920> which<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.310> an

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
you who own the zone DX which is an

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.490 
you who own the zone DX which is an
awesome<00:03:43.910> machine<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.780> highest<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.320> quality

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
awesome machine the highest of quality

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.420 
awesome machine the highest of quality
the<00:03:45.950> best<00:03:46.250> knobs<00:03:47.860> you'd<00:03:48.860> want<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.220> best

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
the best knobs you'd want the best

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.590 
the best knobs you'd want the best
flooring<00:03:49.910> you'd<00:03:50.000> probably<00:03:50.180> want<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.510> use

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
flooring you'd probably want to use

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.520 
flooring you'd probably want to use
tractor<00:03:51.110> with<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.250> works<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:52.640> TP
