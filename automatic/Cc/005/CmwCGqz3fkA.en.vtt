00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
now it's been on there for several

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.920 
now it's been on there for several
months<00:00:49.520> we're<00:00:50.120> actually<00:00:50.329> going<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.660> go<00:00:50.720> right

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
months we're actually going to go right

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.380 
months we're actually going to go right
over<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.489> not<00:00:52.489> only<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:52.790> that<00:00:52.850> just<00:00:53.180> going<00:00:53.270> to

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
over it not only is that just going to

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.990 
over it not only is that just going to
kind<00:00:53.630> of<00:00:53.719> add<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:55.100> whole<00:00:55.280> finish<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.850> it

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
kind of add to the whole finish of it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.910 
kind of add to the whole finish of it
because<00:00:56.360> it's<00:00:56.510> already<00:00:56.660> smooth<00:00:57.079> but<00:00:57.469> when<00:00:57.829> we

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
because it's already smooth but when we

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.690 
because it's already smooth but when we
end<00:00:57.950> up<00:00:58.160> killing<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.550> all<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.059> more<00:00:59.239> difficult

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
end up killing it all the more difficult

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.860 
end up killing it all the more difficult
so<00:01:01.700> we're<00:01:01.850> going<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.000> go<00:01:02.090> right<00:01:02.239> on<00:01:02.270> top<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.660> it

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
so we're going to go right on top of it

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.139 
so we're going to go right on top of it
let<00:01:03.230> me<00:01:03.320> show<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.680> new<00:01:03.770> gun<00:01:03.980> now<00:01:04.159> ok<00:01:04.969> guys

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
let me show you the new gun now ok guys

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.149 
let me show you the new gun now ok guys
the<00:01:05.780> difference<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.289> with<00:01:06.469> this<00:01:06.619> spray<00:01:06.920> gun

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
the difference is with this spray gun

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.160 
the difference is with this spray gun
versus<00:01:07.579> the<00:01:07.729> old<00:01:07.850> spray<00:01:08.119> guns<00:01:08.359> is<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.959> first

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
versus the old spray guns is the first

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.959 
versus the old spray guns is the first
one<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.469> the<00:01:09.859> motor<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:10.520> just<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.789> lot<00:01:10.939> more

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
one is the motor it's just a lot more

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.760 
one is the motor it's just a lot more
powerful<00:01:11.569> it's<00:01:11.810> going<00:01:11.929> to<00:01:11.990> move<00:01:12.079> a<00:01:12.319> lot<00:01:12.590> more

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
powerful it's going to move a lot more

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.129 
powerful it's going to move a lot more
product<00:01:13.219> a<00:01:13.369> lot<00:01:13.850> more<00:01:14.030> efficiently<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.840> gun

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:15.139 
product a lot more efficiently the gun

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.139 
product a lot more efficiently the gun
actually<00:01:15.439> works<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.069> lot<00:01:16.219> better<00:01:16.280> itself<00:01:16.999> as

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
actually works a lot better itself as

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.999 
actually works a lot better itself as
well<00:01:17.359> the<00:01:18.139> problem<00:01:18.469> that<00:01:18.529> we<00:01:18.649> have<00:01:18.770> with<00:01:18.799> the

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
well the problem that we have with the

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.739 
well the problem that we have with the
old<00:01:19.159> spray<00:01:19.429> guns<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.029> it<00:01:20.359> had<00:01:20.569> that

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
old spray guns is that it had that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.690 
old spray guns is that it had that
vertical<00:01:21.170> spray<00:01:21.380> pattern<00:01:21.770> but<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.369> wasn't

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
vertical spray pattern but it wasn't

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.519 
vertical spray pattern but it wasn't
evenly<00:01:23.060> weighted<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.630> was<00:01:23.810> very<00:01:24.049> very<00:01:24.259> heavy

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:24.529 
evenly weighted it was very very heavy

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:26.410 
evenly weighted it was very very heavy
on<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.799> top<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.249> light<00:01:25.429> on<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.670> bottom<00:01:25.850> so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
on the top and light on the bottom so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.489 
on the top and light on the bottom so
that<00:01:26.539> would<00:01:26.630> give<00:01:26.749> a<00:01:26.779> lot<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.049> people<00:01:27.229> that

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
that would give a lot of people that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.649 
that would give a lot of people that
used<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.969> striping<00:01:28.969> when<00:01:29.119> they<00:01:29.240> would<00:01:29.359> paint

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
used it striping when they would paint

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.289 
used it striping when they would paint
or<00:01:29.869> zebra<00:01:30.139> stripes<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.429> with<00:01:31.609> this<00:01:31.819> one<00:01:32.029> it<00:01:32.149> has

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
or zebra stripes so with this one it has

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.149 
or zebra stripes so with this one it has
the<00:01:32.329> vertical<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.139> horizontal<00:01:33.409> spray

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
the vertical and the horizontal spray

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.219 
the vertical and the horizontal spray
patterns<00:01:34.549> but<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.090> really<00:01:35.420> evenly<00:01:35.990> weighted

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
patterns but the really evenly weighted

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.649 
patterns but the really evenly weighted
that<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:36.920> goes<00:01:37.069> straight<00:01:37.279> up<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.999> down<00:01:38.029> it's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
that just goes straight up and down it's

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.359 
that just goes straight up and down it's
a<00:01:38.779> lot<00:01:38.990> easier<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.439> just<00:01:39.590> get<00:01:39.799> clean<00:01:40.130> even

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
a lot easier to just get clean even

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.120 
a lot easier to just get clean even
passes<00:01:41.029> and<00:01:41.179> get<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.659> smooth<00:01:41.990> finish<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.649> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
passes and get that smooth finish so the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.489 
passes and get that smooth finish so the
gun<00:01:43.369> works<00:01:43.789> a<00:01:43.939> lot<00:01:44.029> better<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.990> motor<00:01:45.229> works

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
gun works a lot better the motor works

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.379 
gun works a lot better the motor works
better<00:01:45.770> but<00:01:46.340> actually<00:01:47.060> one<00:01:47.209> of<00:01:47.299> the

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
better but actually one of the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:48.789 
better but actually one of the
complaints<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:47.990> used<00:01:48.139> to<00:01:48.259> have<00:01:48.439> is<00:01:48.649> that
