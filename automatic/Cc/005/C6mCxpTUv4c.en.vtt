sound ways crying what is sound I what
to<00:00:05.190> do

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to do

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.150 
to do
sound<00:00:06.299> whenever<00:00:06.600> speakers<00:00:07.259> move<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.859> creates

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
sound whenever speakers move it creates

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.339 
sound whenever speakers move it creates
pressure<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:09.090> your<00:00:09.240> eardrums<00:00:09.660> pick<00:00:09.960> up<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
pressure that your eardrums pick up and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.410 
pressure that your eardrums pick up and
that<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.160> what<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> known<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:11.759> sound<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
that is what is known as sound the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
that is what is known as sound the
vibrations<00:00:13.049> created<00:00:13.410> by<00:00:13.559> speakers<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.429> your

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
vibrations created by speakers that your

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.129 
vibrations created by speakers that your
here's<00:00:14.849> your<00:00:15.269> ears<00:00:15.480> pick<00:00:15.750> up

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
here's your ears pick up

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.830 
here's your ears pick up
so<00:00:16.830> why<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.359> were<00:00:18.510> hay<00:00:18.630> for

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
so why like so these were hay for

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
so why like so these were hay for
example<00:00:19.260> right<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:20.130> what's<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> purpose<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
example right like what's the purpose of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.609 
example right like what's the purpose of
these<00:00:21.270> holding<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.930> palpable<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
these holding up it is palpable that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.880 
these holding up it is palpable that
hole<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.490> actually<00:00:23.880> called<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.560> vent<00:00:25.560> it's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
hole is actually called a vent it's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.490 
hole is actually called a vent it's
because<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.880> box<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> ported<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> it's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
because this box is ported and it's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.730 
because this box is ported and it's
tuned<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> certain<00:00:29.460> certain<00:00:29.939> frequency<00:00:30.740> now

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
tuned to a certain certain frequency now

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.350 
tuned to a certain certain frequency now
when<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> ported<00:00:32.640> box<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.210> have

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
when you have a ported box you have

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.870 
when you have a ported box you have
added<00:00:33.809> output<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.520> air

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
added output because you have more air

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.440 
added output because you have more air
moving<00:00:36.480> within<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:37.020> vehicle<00:00:37.850> like<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.120> box

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
moving within your vehicle like this box

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.530 
moving within your vehicle like this box
for<00:00:39.750> instance<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.350> tuned<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> 35<00:00:41.370> Hertz<00:00:41.760> which

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
for instance is tuned to 35 Hertz which

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
for instance is tuned to 35 Hertz which
is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.750> good<00:00:43.110> combination<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.309> vehicle<00:00:44.789> as

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
is a good combination for the vehicle as

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
is a good combination for the vehicle as
well<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> speakers<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:48.079> vehicles<00:00:49.079> also

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
well as the speakers now vehicles also

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
well as the speakers now vehicles also
have<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> tuning<00:00:50.489> frequency<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.780> you're

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
have a tuning frequency which if you're

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
have a tuning frequency which if you're
an<00:00:52.350> SPL<00:00:52.770> competitor<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.550> try<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> match<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
an SPL competitor you try to match the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
an SPL competitor you try to match the
tuning<00:00:55.170> frequency<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.070> box<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.059> car

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
tuning frequency of your box to your car

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
tuning frequency of your box to your car
so<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:58.590> vibrate<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> same

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so all of them vibrate at the same

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.310 
so all of them vibrate at the same
frequency<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.690> give<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> higher<00:01:01.649> SPL<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
frequency and give you higher SPL so I

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
frequency and give you higher SPL so I
like<00:01:04.320> how<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.129> decibels<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
like how where decibels going like that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
like how where decibels going like that
like<00:01:06.540> what's<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> most<00:01:07.020> what's<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> most

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
like what's the most what's the most

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
like what's the most what's the most
decibels<00:01:08.460> I've<00:01:08.670> recorded<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.360> car<00:01:09.540> or

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
decibels I've recorded in the car or

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
decibels I've recorded in the car or
something<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.770> ever<00:01:11.130> recorded<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
something at the most ever recorded I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.330 
something at the most ever recorded I
believe<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:13.100> 181<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> Pioneer<00:01:15.509> guys

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
believe is a 181 by the Pioneer guys

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
believe is a 181 by the Pioneer guys
that<00:01:17.340> ball<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.700> sound<00:01:17.970> pressure<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.659> bad

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that ball like sound pressure is not bad

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
that ball like sound pressure is not bad
just<00:01:19.049> by<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:19.380> hard<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.799> hit<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.880> sound

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
just by how hard a hit it's like sound

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
just by how hard a hit it's like sound
pressure<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.900> actually<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> microphone<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
pressure it's actually a microphone that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.550 
pressure it's actually a microphone that
picks<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.520> pressure<00:01:23.880> created<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:24.570> speakers<00:01:25.490> so

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
picks up pressure created by speakers so

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.810 
picks up pressure created by speakers so
how<00:01:28.560> many<00:01:28.619> watch<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.070> run<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:29.759> here

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
how many watch you run in this part here

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.600 
how many watch you run in this part here
in<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.780> car<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.229> running<00:01:31.560> about<00:01:31.740> seventy

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
in this car I'm running about seventy

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
in this car I'm running about seventy
two<00:01:32.790> hundred<00:01:32.909> watts<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.960> only<00:01:34.320> 4,800<00:01:35.159> are

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
two hundred watts but only 4,800 are

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.060 
two hundred watts but only 4,800 are
going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> subs<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> never<00:01:37.560> had<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
going to the subs so I never had a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.830 
going to the subs so I never had a
decibel<00:01:38.430> later<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.509> have

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
decibel later on this thing I have

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.539 
decibel later on this thing I have
actually<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
actually how much was that how was that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
actually how much was that how was that
it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.540> fifty<00:01:42.869> two<00:01:42.899> point<00:01:43.290> four

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it was actually one fifty two point four
