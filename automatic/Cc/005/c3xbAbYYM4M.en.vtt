honestly<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> fact<00:01:14.939> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
honestly I you know the fact that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.890 
honestly I you know the fact that
they're<00:01:15.180> working<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> mac<00:01:15.750> client

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
hopefully we'll see that soon I think

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.840 
hopefully we'll see that soon I think
this<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.820> probably<00:01:17.990> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:20.369> good

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
this is probably going to be a good

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.609 
this is probably going to be a good
solution<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.110> fact<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.409> it's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
solution for you and the fact that it's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.690 
solution for you and the fact that it's
in<00:01:22.890> beta<00:01:23.540> likely<00:01:24.540> means<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
in beta likely means that it is going to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
in beta likely means that it is going to
