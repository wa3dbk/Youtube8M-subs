and then the little

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.820 
and then the little
worse<00:01:05.050> survivor<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:07.300> arrive<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:08.020> top<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.680> that

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
uphill section you have to stab the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.360 
uphill section you have to stab the
brakes<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.140> then<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.350> almost<00:01:11.620> slow<00:01:11.950> down<00:01:12.130> to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
brakes and then you almost slow down to

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.150 
brakes and then you almost slow down to
first<00:01:12.670> gear<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.290> way<00:01:14.440> it's<00:01:14.620> blind<00:01:14.890> when<00:01:15.040> you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
first gear the way it's blind when you

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.650 
first gear the way it's blind when you
when<00:01:15.430> you<00:01:15.460> turn<00:01:15.729> into<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.150> left<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.510> only

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
when you turn into the left the only

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.810 
when you turn into the left the only
thing<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.900> see<00:01:17.110> attributes<00:01:17.650> is<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.310> top<00:01:18.550> of<00:01:18.700> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
thing you see attributes is a top of the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.820 
thing you see attributes is a top of the
trees<00:01:19.060> we've<00:01:19.930> seen<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.080> lot<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.320> action<00:01:20.680> there

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
trees we've seen a lot of action there

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.250 
trees we've seen a lot of action there
people<00:01:21.130> trying<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.460> outbreak<00:01:21.880> each<00:01:22.060> other

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260

looking<00:01:23.260> forward<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.710> big<00:01:23.830> fights<00:01:24.100> there

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
looking forward to the big fights there

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.640 
looking forward to the big fights there
it<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.240> challenging<00:01:25.479> because<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:26.170> can't<00:01:26.410> see

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
it is challenging because you can't see

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.700 
it is challenging because you can't see
but<00:01:26.890> at<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.070> same<00:01:27.280> time<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.670> really<00:01:27.910> slow<00:01:28.210> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
but at the same time it's really slow in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.680 
but at the same time it's really slow in
my<00:01:29.710> opinion<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.250> real<00:01:30.640> challenge<00:01:31.240> after<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
my opinion the real challenge after the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.710 
my opinion the real challenge after the
corkscrew<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.830> next<00:01:33.100> one

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
corkscrew is the next one

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.720 
corkscrew is the next one
unbelievably<00:01:35.620> quick<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.400> were<00:01:36.490> basically

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
unbelievably quick you were basically

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.030 
unbelievably quick you were basically
just<00:01:37.240> hanging<00:01:37.690> on<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:38.650> steering

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
just hanging on to the to the steering

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.660 
just hanging on to the to the steering
trying<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.880> go<00:01:39.970> wide<00:01:40.270> open

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
you go down hill fast left-hander and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.200 
you go down hill fast left-hander and
and<00:01:45.729> big<00:01:46.240> commitment
