00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.029
 m 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.970
 2 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.110
 that is why if not reached if not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.410
 will be 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.240
 eight 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.500
 So 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 May 26, 2005 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 in report 1 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.310
 in the package 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.180
 and here's a new twist 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.040
 was walking 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.080
 pardon 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.710
 answer this question 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.119
 if, however, they fall into this 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.540
 statistics 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.230
 square 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.570
 I ask for the ridiculous coming months 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.620
 The moment I don't want to be right now is 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.060
 mean for such papers dress up march 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.560
 at the site 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.710
 surely on football then another 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.760
 why 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.900
 and who snowed but while the TV show project 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.810
 podium law office transition 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.920
 workers 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.370
 agree very nice 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 in this case 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.810
 both exhibitions turned out 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 after spinning 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.720
 before the start of the new course of growth 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.049
 dollar however attempts 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.280
 Karabalyk 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.650
 its consequences 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.220
 I haven't had any contact with 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.540
 user about how 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.830
 such that you need to work 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 Well, of course 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.950
 and other official wanted and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.370
 blogosphere

 especially worth noting something to buy 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.689
 rub plus lutsenko 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.890
 that's why 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.259
 I understand one way or another from the cameras 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.529
 Mr. N 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.089
 Shimicha live normally on the principle of points 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.119
 its a word of facts but more is just that 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.849
 then from there elections 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.540
 and here is this syndrome 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.460
 filed a look at what would remove all 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.160
 happened
