 3 playstation 4 and xbox the year in media 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.090
 digital 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.460
 And, folks, it's okay that you guys think 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.750
 play here again 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 and this time the guys talk about 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.950
 next lcd GTA5 whom blessings of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.180
 law that was leaked 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.890
 because it's personal even the last 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 maine hotel upgrade has gone out there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 little time information about the next 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860
 it has been leaked much has been 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.660
 speculated about it even spoke 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 who to finish 500 who had power 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 travel to the city that is part of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.930
 the map and also speculated that this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 update vehicles already assaults but 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.980
 this information was false 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 from photomontage and oppression of the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 xbox website that posted with the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 9 lcd information in fact 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 it was just a simple trick that gives 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.489
 to make any browser as per 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.100
 example google chrome that they have a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.689
 function call and inspect element e 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.820
 you can modify the text codes 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.460
 to put the image more clearly than 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.930
 this does not actually change the page and 5 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 humala shown to you 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 so it was super simple of what they did and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.509
 it has already been contested that it was false 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.100
 but finally on the assaults to imagine 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.140
 fake but can not really say that they do not 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 will come out in the next update as 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 I spoke here on the sony play channel 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.939
 the robberies were postponed by rockstar 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.430
 if no expected date of release 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 but coming from the rockstar in the galley is fine 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.970
 predictable then you can not doubt 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 much of this, but now we are going to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.619
 information that, by all indications, is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.720
 Real people actually leaked at the end of the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.369
 xbox live website this line of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.090
 Programming the team after a screen for 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.490
 you 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 it indicates the name of the new incident pec 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 what will independence day be like 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.470
 for those who do not know or just a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 american holiday celebrating the day 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.979
 united states independence 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 when its 13 colonies declared 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.759
 formal separation of the empire of the Grand 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.280
 and they celebrate the most 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.799
 specifically on the 4th of July this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.960
 same week next and after the leak 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.879
 these much information has already been 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.130
 speculated the update method 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.650
 solved clothes 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.460
 weapons some vehicles gestures and much 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.930
 more 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.550
 and for this update it is possible that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.510
 come thematic clothes consultants of the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.610
 U.S 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.440
 red white and blue believe 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.270
 also turn Uncle Sam's top hat 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.460
 is the symbol of the American Army beyond 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.560
 of masks of the berlingo among others 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.630
 American symbols also speculate that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.310
 can come here the military this time 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.470
 personnel based on the parades that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 happens there on the 4th of July according to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.920
 the vehicles that will be 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.300
 added will be 1 and civic is a 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.520
 kind of army fighting jeep 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.210
 American helicopters as well as 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.070
 attack 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.870
 As you can see on the screen this is a 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.120
 propaganda wars touch is a store of 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.590
 weapons of the game and it is linked to the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.540
 life in the day that the social network of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 game and in this advertisement already showed 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.960
 these vehicles but they had no 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.670
 still in the game the only appearance of 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.220
 helicopters was the trailer for the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.690
 movie movie you have in the game appears 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.210
 a cancer that is a helicopter that had 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.280
 in gta san andreas and also in gta 4 if 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.250
 I'm not mistaken, but he does not have it today. 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.260
 35 so far by the bishop reminding 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.670
 that this is just speculation guys 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.860
 about this content there are still no 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.870
 concrete evidence now on the weapons 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.610
 some files also leaked in gta 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.440
 forum user posted a photo of a 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.670
 single-engine airplane I've never seen in the game 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.680
 and I do not know where he got it either 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.240
 this picture but the photo does not seem to me 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.890
 nothing mount people 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.970
 in addition he published the rudi that are 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.100
 those images that appear with 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.020
 Game screen information two models 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.240
 new weapon that is the new launcher of 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.280
 grenades and a new kind of hitler 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.520
 second forum and launches grenades and is 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.000
 based on 1 x 1 and 25 and a rifle on the m 4 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.410
 to 1 both with several types of test and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.120
 customizations is not yet confirmed 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.250
 that these weapons had really 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.050
 in that it updates its independence but the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.060
 sure that they will come out in some 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.320
 update and the guy who leaked the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.600
 information from both the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.000
 programming how many guns the airplane is 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.100
 same source that has already passed other lc like 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.740
 for example lc give support to the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.840
 beatbox tec and the dlc itself the nokia 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.430
 hipster then the guy did not quote several 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.709
 Sometimes he's already taken the mornings. 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.050
 so you can have at least 99% of 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.270
 sure that these things will 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.220
 as it has 1% of doubt because the rockstar 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.990
 It's unpredictable, so you see, right? 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.270
 other than what they think about the clc 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.919
 is the name of independence day 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.239
 for those who do not remember independence day is the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.130
 name of an excellent film about the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.170
 attack the land fleet on land 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.570
 the movie is from 1900 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.790
 96th year of birth and has a 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.700
 escaped cast as for example smits 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.680
 Tweety mann August ban and more 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.780
 only continuing the reasoning thematic 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.880
 of the film is an alien invasion 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.680
 but the agency something that is quite common in 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.540
 game as it has recently begun to 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.370
 appear on the map of gt online some 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.440
 ships in the middle of the city and 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.240
 meteors is something that did not happen with 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.990
 everyone but happened to many 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.730
 people 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.290
 even some theories about it 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.760
 people saying that this was a clue 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.800
 rockstar about the new expulsion of the 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.020
 game or what they were going to show in the 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.340
 e3 and after a while the vacancies 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.630
 they just disappeared 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.580
 I 'm not saying with all the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.080
 sure you have to see but already thought if 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.820
 this was a sign indicating 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.860
 new update because if you are 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.600
 stop to think it's all about 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.890
 rockstar has already done something unusual in the day 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.480
 of the boyfriends she could have done 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.080
 simply a valentine tv 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.030
 day 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.130
 but she did not did a thematic of 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.690
 brand based on Al Capone and also in 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.250
 valentine day slaughter 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.830
 so here is always one step ahead 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.710
 The obvious guys are not there to tip the 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.150
 You would have been really fucking already 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.810
 thought an alien attack on gta 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.180
 online 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.900
 it was a meteor shower was going to be very 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.460
 fuck 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.290
 good information is not 100% 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.910
 confirmed but as I already said 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.070
 the unreliable sources and also the 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.750
 voting always makes them systematic 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.640
 we had the prudent Christmas there 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.560
 filled the snow saints we also had the 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.030
 independent valentine then it would not 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.820
 Something from another world that I only wanted 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.830
 It should also be good personnel this fire of 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.360
 today I'm sorry it takes to launch general 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.370
 begging to make a talking video 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.230
 about it and as you have seen I made a 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.180
 major research for the study was real and 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.340
 It's also the only discount for you 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.080
 So I think it was worth it and if you 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.700
 did you like the video if it caught your 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.230
