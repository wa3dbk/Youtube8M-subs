one<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> saw<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> branch<00:00:19.140> line<00:00:19.470> between

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
one I saw was on a branch line between

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.490 
one I saw was on a branch line between
Chester<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.670> crew<00:00:21.000> back<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> 70s<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
were just sort of trundling along there

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
were just sort of trundling along there
on<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:30.869> short<00:00:31.170> branch<00:00:31.500> line<00:00:31.800> going

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
on this little short branch line going

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.270 
on this little short branch line going
down<00:00:32.160> into<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> big<00:00:32.880> junction<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> crew<00:00:34.280> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
down into the big junction of crew and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.370 
down into the big junction of crew and
as<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.550> come<00:00:35.760> into<00:00:35.969> crew<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.930> there's<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
as you come into crew you know there's a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.910 
as you come into crew you know there's a
big<00:00:38.059> if<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.809> junction<00:00:40.320> station<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
big if it's a junction station so you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
big if it's a junction station so you
stop<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.520> star<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> stopping

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
stop and your star and then you stopping

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.569 
stop and your star and then you stopping
you<00:00:42.930> start<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.370> these

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you start and it was on one of these

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.850 
you start and it was on one of these
stockings<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.270> starting<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.260> when<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.770> were

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
stopped and looking out onto the field

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
stopped and looking out onto the field
to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.289> left<00:00:49.410> hand<00:00:49.770> side<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> was

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
gazing around and I looked at the field

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
gazing around and I looked at the field
off<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> my<00:01:01.230> left<00:01:01.260> where<00:01:01.649> there<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.859> some

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
off to my left where there was some

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.450 
off to my left where there was some
great<00:01:02.280> big<00:01:02.609> cooling<00:01:03.149> chimneys<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
great big cooling chimneys there and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.250 
great big cooling chimneys there and
right<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.970> front<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> cooling<00:01:06.810> chimneys

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
right in front of the cooling chimneys

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.010 
right in front of the cooling chimneys
right<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> ground<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
right down on the ground and this is in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
right down on the ground and this is in
early<00:01:10.530> July<00:01:12.680> sunshine<00:01:13.680> there<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> huge

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
early July sunshine there was this huge

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
early July sunshine there was this huge
orb<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.049> sitting

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
orb and it was just it was just sitting

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.550 
orb and it was just it was just sitting
there<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.610> side<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> side<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:22.229> round

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
there and from side to side right round

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
there and from side to side right round
the<00:01:22.770> circumference<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.360> dome<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the circumference of it the dome of it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.429 
the circumference of it the dome of it
there<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> perfect<00:01:25.799> little<00:01:25.920> rainbow

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
there was a perfect little rainbow

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.100 
there was a perfect little rainbow
really<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.650> must<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.520> been<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.360> sometimes

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
really it must have been I sometimes

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
really it must have been I sometimes
wonder<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.740> many<00:01:31.920> feet<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.700> been

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
wonder how many feet it would have been

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
wonder how many feet it would have been
if<00:01:33.090> I'd<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.299> walked<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.170> suppose<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
if I'd have walked up to it I suppose it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
if I'd have walked up to it I suppose it
would<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.490> been<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.700> four<00:01:36.390> times<00:01:36.659> my

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
would have been like four times my

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.039 
would have been like four times my
height<00:01:37.700> therefore<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.060> being<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> circle<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
height therefore it being a circle it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
height therefore it being a circle it
would<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.320> been<00:01:40.439> four<00:01:40.710> times<00:01:40.950> my<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.549> know

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
would have been four times my you know

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
would have been four times my you know
out<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> other<00:01:42.210> side<00:01:42.329> sort<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.960> things<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
out the other side sort of things so it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.260 
out the other side sort of things so it
was<00:01:44.310> sort<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.689> 30-foot<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.020> guess<00:01:46.759> ish<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
was sort of like 30-foot I guess ish and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.249 
was sort of like 30-foot I guess ish and
it<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.619> humming<00:01:50.270> humming<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.960> he<00:01:52.020> was

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it was just humming humming how he was

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.179
