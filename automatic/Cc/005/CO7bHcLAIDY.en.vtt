00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
component cables as i already said

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.350 
component cables as i already said
another<00:03:28.410> great<00:03:28.740> thing<00:03:28.950> about<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:30.150> rock

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
another great thing about this the rock

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.530 
another great thing about this the rock
show<00:03:30.570> right<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:32.300> fits<00:03:33.300> in

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
show right here you can see it fits in

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.610 
show right here you can see it fits in
my<00:03:33.660> hand<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:35.370> has<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.540> out<00:03:36.780> ports<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.500> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
my hand it has in and out ports as you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.309 
my hand it has in and out ports as you
can<00:03:37.800> see<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.520> component<00:03:39.300> in<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:40.140> is

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
can see here is component in this is

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.130 
can see here is component in this is
where<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.739> would<00:03:40.890> plug<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.640> your<00:03:42.060> xbox<00:03:42.360> 360

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
where you would plug it in your xbox 360

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.100 
where you would plug it in your xbox 360
or<00:03:43.320> ps3<00:03:43.680> into<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.300> audio<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
or ps3 into it this is the audio for the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.900 
or ps3 into it this is the audio for the
handing<00:03:46.530> over<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.190> side<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.730> out

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
handing over on this side is the out

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.660 
handing over on this side is the out
this<00:03:48.600> would<00:03:48.870> go<00:03:49.050> out<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> your<00:03:49.470> TV<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.860> video

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
this would go out to your TV a video

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.390 
this would go out to your TV a video
right<00:03:50.820> here<00:03:50.850> in<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> audio<00:03:51.390> right<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:52.400> USB

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
right here in the audio right here USB

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.490 
right here in the audio right here USB
port<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.440> basically<00:03:56.570> having<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.350> out

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
port so basically having the in and out

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.380 
port so basically having the in and out
port<00:03:58.890> eliminates<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.640> need<00:03:59.820> to<00:04:00.090> have

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
port eliminates the need to have

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.180 
port eliminates the need to have
splitters<00:04:01.050> or<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.350> video<00:04:01.709> distribution

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
splitters or a video distribution

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.090 
splitters or a video distribution
amplifier<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.590> wouldn't<00:04:04.920> need<00:04:05.040> that

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
amplifier so you wouldn't need that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.670 
amplifier so you wouldn't need that
which<00:04:05.550> saves<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:06.060> money<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:07.290> lot<00:04:07.380> less

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
which saves you money and a lot less

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.840 
which saves you money and a lot less
cables<00:04:08.430> flying<00:04:08.880> around<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.420> room<00:04:10.670> put<00:04:11.670> this

right here and over here we have a
component<00:05:42.010> so<00:05:43.010> that's<00:05:43.400> basically<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:44.210> as<00:05:44.450> you

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
component so that's basically it as you

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.390 
component so that's basically it as you
can<00:05:44.750> see<00:05:45.020> we<00:05:45.230> have<00:05:45.260> a<00:05:45.710> Roxio<00:05:46.370> right<00:05:47.090> over<00:05:47.330> here

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
can see we have a Roxio right over here

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.520

cables basically these right here would

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.160 
cables basically these right here would
go<00:05:56.560> cables<00:05:57.560> audio<00:05:57.950> cables<00:05:58.430> would<00:05:58.550> go<00:05:58.790> in<00:05:59.170> here

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
go cables audio cables would go in here

color<00:06:24.200> but<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.740> other<00:06:24.830> two<00:06:25.130> have<00:06:25.340> so

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
color but the other two have so

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.810 
color but the other two have so
obviously<00:06:26.030> this<00:06:26.210> is<00:06:26.390> more<00:06:26.570> than<00:06:26.600> likely<00:06:26.900> green

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
obviously this is more than likely green

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.760 
obviously this is more than likely green
but<00:06:28.820> have<00:06:28.940> been<00:06:29.120> a<00:06:29.620> manufacturing<00:06:30.620> error<00:06:32.770> blue

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
but have been a manufacturing error blue

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:41.740 
but have been a manufacturing error blue
right<00:06:34.070> over<00:06:34.340> here<00:06:37.150> and<00:06:38.320> red<00:06:39.430> so<00:06:40.430> it<00:06:40.730> would<00:06:41.570> be

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
right over here and red so it would be

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.770 
right over here and red so it would be
set<00:06:42.080> these<00:06:42.470> as<00:06:42.890> I<00:06:43.190> always<00:06:43.340> said<00:06:43.700> audio<00:06:44.270> cables

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
set these as I always said audio cables

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.930 
set these as I always said audio cables
branch<00:06:45.200> out<00:06:45.470> TV<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:48.040> right<00:06:49.040> here<00:06:49.070> we<00:06:49.550> have<00:06:49.730> the

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
branch out TV and right here we have the

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.000 
branch out TV and right here we have the
component<00:06:50.300> ones<00:06:50.660> which<00:06:51.020> would<00:06:51.320> branch<00:06:51.710> out<00:06:51.980> to

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
component ones which would branch out to

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.490 
component ones which would branch out to
the<00:06:52.190> TV<00:06:52.370> as<00:06:52.580> well<00:06:52.850> this<00:06:53.600> side<00:06:53.840> as<00:06:54.050> I<00:06:54.170> said

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
the TV as well this side as I said

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.360 
the TV as well this side as I said
before<00:06:54.530> what<00:06:55.220> up<00:06:56.080> branch<00:06:57.080> out<00:06:57.230> the<00:06:57.560> Xbox<00:06:58.130> would

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
before what up branch out the Xbox would

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.450 
before what up branch out the Xbox would
be<00:06:58.550> plugged<00:06:58.850> into<00:06:59.030> this

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
be plugged into this

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.490 
be plugged into this
