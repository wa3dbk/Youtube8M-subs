future or he should be continuously
pumping<00:00:13.200> out<00:00:13.349> Linkin<00:00:13.769> Roach<00:00:15.020> yeah<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
pumping out Linkin Roach yeah so the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.279 
pumping out Linkin Roach yeah so the
larva<00:00:17.310> counts<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.850> good<00:00:18.029> he's<00:00:18.539> got<00:00:18.690> 37

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
larva counts going good he's got 37

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550 
larva counts going good he's got 37
drones<00:00:19.590> opposed<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.820> blue<00:00:21.029> 31<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> only

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
drones opposed to blue 31 so I only

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.689 
drones opposed to blue 31 so I only
could<00:00:22.830> take<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.310> he's<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
could take it that he's got the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.320 
could take it that he's got the
economical<00:00:24.689> advantage<00:00:25.109> which<00:00:25.289> he<00:00:25.410> does<00:00:26.330> so

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
economical advantage which he does so

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
economical advantage which he does so
yeah<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.320> red<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.039> dominating

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
yeah as of right now red is dominating

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.730 
yeah as of right now red is dominating
he's<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.060> map<00:00:30.390> control<00:00:30.869> he's<00:00:31.439> got<00:00:31.470> his

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
he's got map control he's got his

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.620 
he's got map control he's got his
Overlord<00:00:32.250> scouting<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> map<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
Overlord scouting all over the map to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.750 
Overlord scouting all over the map to
make<00:00:33.780> sure<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.559> blue<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.399> trying

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
make sure that blue is not trying

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
might be thinking about attacking which

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.649 
might be thinking about attacking which
would<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.799> bad<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.280> him<00:01:23.659> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
would be all the way bad for him and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
would be all the way bad for him and
he's<00:01:25.020> continued<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> build<00:01:25.710> units<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
he's continued to build units which is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
he's continued to build units which is
good<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:27.299> good<00:01:27.479> good<00:01:27.689> still<00:01:28.259> building

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
good good good good still building

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.120 
good good good good still building
probes<00:01:28.920> fantastic<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
probes fantastic now one thing that I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.600 
probes fantastic now one thing that I
will<00:01:32.340> say<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.790> dude<00:01:33.509> did<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:34.610> he

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
will say that dude did good he

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.569 
will say that dude did good he
transitioned<00:01:36.420> his<00:01:36.689> probes<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.500> his<00:01:38.189> second

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
transitioned his probes into his second

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.179 
transitioned his probes into his second
base<00:01:38.790> he<00:01:39.720> did<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.170> stop<00:01:40.500> building<00:01:40.740> probes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
base he did not stop building probes

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
base he did not stop building probes
basically<00:01:42.000> since<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> beginning<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
basically since the beginning of the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.940 
basically since the beginning of the
game<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.340> means<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> time<00:01:45.840> came<00:01:46.170> he

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
game so that means when the time came he

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.609 
game so that means when the time came he
could<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.939> 15<00:01:48.270> probes<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
could take you know 15 probes and just

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.340 
could take you know 15 probes and just
scoot<00:01:50.130> him<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.399> over<00:01:50.430> there<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> know

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
scoot him right over there you know

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.600 
scoot him right over there you know
which<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> great<00:01:53.270> opposed<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> when<00:01:54.689> red<00:01:55.610> had

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
which is great opposed to when red had

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
which is great opposed to when red had
his<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:57.719> didn't<00:01:57.990> start<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.619> building

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
his he didn't start you know building

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.429 
his he didn't start you know building
drones<00:01:59.369> for<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> while<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:03.439> nothing

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
drones for a while so you know nothing

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.180 
drones for a while so you know nothing
big<00:02:04.649> i<00:02:04.829> mean<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.280> mid-level<00:02:05.729> play<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
big i mean this is mid-level play so you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.479 
big i mean this is mid-level play so you
