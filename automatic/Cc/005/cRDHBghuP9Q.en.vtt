importantly<00:03:03.650> we're<00:03:04.190> looking<00:03:04.550> for<00:03:04.760> black<00:03:04.910> ops

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
importantly we're looking for black ops

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.120 
importantly we're looking for black ops
1<00:03:05.300> snipers<00:03:06.050> like<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.620> regular<00:03:06.920> black

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
1 snipers like just on the regular black

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.479 
1 snipers like just on the regular black
ops<00:03:08.019> we<00:03:09.019> think<00:03:09.290> it's<00:03:09.620> really<00:03:09.920> really<00:03:10.160> hard<00:03:10.370> to

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
ops we think it's really really hard to

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.000 
ops we think it's really really hard to
snipe<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.000> game<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.570> if<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.709> snipe

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.350 
snipe on the game so if you like snipe
on<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.310> game<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:13.850> you're<00:03:14.000> really<00:03:14.209> good

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
on that game and if you're really good

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.080
