00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
sometimes these these colors that we

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.140 
sometimes these these colors that we
shoot<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.679> give<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.370> put<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.940> in

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.700 
its and it's thin as too much
transparency<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.600> cold<00:00:19.109> after<00:00:19.470> coat

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
really what counts the most really wanna

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.180 
really what counts the most really wanna
lay<00:00:58.940> them<00:00:59.090> out<00:00:59.210> nicely<00:00:59.510> wanna<00:01:00.080> take<00:01:00.380> your<00:01:00.560> time

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
lay them out nicely wanna take your time

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.270 
lay them out nicely wanna take your time
especially<00:01:01.850> on<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.970> metallic<00:01:02.480> color<00:01:02.690> like<00:01:02.960> this

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
especially on a metallic color like this

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.130 
especially on a metallic color like this
so<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.370> metallic<00:01:04.699> lays<00:01:05.089> down<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.900> point

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
so the metallic lays down to the point

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.140 
so the metallic lays down to the point
where<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.500> just<00:01:06.710> sparkles<00:01:07.220> right<00:01:07.490> back<00:01:07.729> at<00:01:07.970> you

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
where it just sparkles right back at you

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150 
where it just sparkles right back at you
when<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.479> clear<00:01:08.780> coat<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.140> put<00:01:09.320> on<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.620> in<00:01:10.040> a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
when the clear coat is put on it in a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:26.139 
when the clear coat is put on it in a
sunlight<00:01:22.060> now<00:01:23.060> we'll<00:01:23.330> unmask<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.619> stripe<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
sunlight now we'll unmask the stripe the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.870 
sunlight now we'll unmask the stripe the
white<00:01:26.330> stripe<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:27.380> then<00:01:28.130> we'll<00:01:28.310> kind<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.640> give

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
white stripe and then we'll kind of give

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.810 
white stripe and then we'll kind of give
the<00:01:29.030> edges<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.720> just<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:30.080> light<00:01:30.350> sanding<00:01:31.040> so

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the edges of it just a light sanding so

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.400 
the edges of it just a light sanding so
this<00:01:31.910> way<00:01:32.090> when<00:01:32.300> this<00:01:32.450> whole<00:01:32.690> thing<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:32.990> clear

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
this way when this whole thing is clear

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.040 
this way when this whole thing is clear
coated<00:01:33.649> you<00:01:34.490> basically<00:01:35.210> won't<00:01:35.509> even<00:01:35.840> really

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
coated you basically won't even really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.710 
coated you basically won't even really
feel<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.920> difference<00:01:36.950> between<00:01:37.520> one<00:01:38.300> edge<00:01:38.509> and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
feel the difference between one edge and

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.030 
feel the difference between one edge and
the<00:01:38.840> other<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.080> mean<00:01:39.259> they'll<00:01:39.410> be<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.560> little<00:01:39.860> bit

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.580 
the other I mean they'll be a little bit
there<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.580> should<00:01:41.210> do<00:01:41.330> have<00:01:41.540> one<00:01:42.020> paint<00:01:42.320> on

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590
