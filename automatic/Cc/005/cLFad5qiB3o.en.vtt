now you can see you can see the vram

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.410 
now you can see you can see the vram
here<00:02:54.680> again<00:02:54.860> absolutely<00:02:55.670> cooked<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.270> these

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
here again absolutely cooked in these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.480 
here again absolutely cooked in these
big<00:02:56.660> texture<00:02:57.110> tests<00:02:57.470> that's<00:02:57.620> really<00:02:58.130> fun<00:02:58.340> to

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
big texture tests that's really fun to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:04:23.240 
big texture tests that's really fun to
see

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.030 

and<00:04:23.850> here<00:04:24.060> we<00:04:24.180> go<00:04:24.330> running<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.780> classic<00:04:25.710> bit<00:04:25.920> of

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:57.899 
what I really liked about tests CPU is

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.260 
what I really liked about tests CPU is
that<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.259> have<00:04:58.439> this<00:04:58.589> really<00:04:59.460> big<00:04:59.669> database

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
that you have this really big database

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.179 
that you have this really big database
of<00:05:00.479> CPUs<00:05:01.020> which<00:05:01.229> you<00:05:01.349> can<00:05:01.439> go<00:05:01.589> through<00:05:01.619> and<00:05:02.099> it

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.189 
of CPUs which you can go through and it

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.459 
of CPUs which you can go through and it
shows<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.639> you<00:05:03.330> know<00:05:03.479> where<00:05:03.689> you<00:05:04.199> match<00:05:04.439> up

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:04.469 
shows you you know where you match up

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.889 
shows you you know where you match up
against<00:05:05.159> a<00:05:05.279> bunch<00:05:05.430> more<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:06.270> obviously<00:05:06.629> came

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:06.899 
against a bunch more this obviously came

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.679 
against a bunch more this obviously came
out<00:05:07.110> quite<00:05:07.949> a<00:05:08.009> long<00:05:08.369> time<00:05:08.729> afterwards<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.539> does

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
out quite a long time afterwards it does

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.499 
out quite a long time afterwards it does
have<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.080> lot<00:05:10.319> of<00:05:10.349> more<00:05:10.710> modern<00:05:11.249> processors<00:05:11.969> it

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
have a lot of more modern processors it

00:05:12.509 --> 00:06:03.950 
have a lot of more modern processors it
would<00:05:12.659> probably<00:05:12.839> work<00:05:13.080> on<00:05:13.409> modern<00:05:13.680> pcs

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.230 

who<00:06:04.830> remembers<00:06:05.250> half-life<00:06:05.759> from<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.060> first

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
who remembers half-life from the first

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.469 
who remembers half-life from the first
time<00:06:06.479> around<00:06:06.720> in<00:06:07.190> 1998<00:06:08.190> so<00:06:08.819> I<00:06:08.850> just<00:06:09.120> loaded<00:06:09.300> it

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
time around in 1998 so I just loaded it

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.120 
time around in 1998 so I just loaded it
up<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.930> just<00:06:10.110> messed<00:06:10.410> around<00:06:10.560> for<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:10.979> couple

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
up and just messed around for a couple

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.309 
up and just messed around for a couple
of<00:06:11.340> minutes<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:11.850> know<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.599> capture<00:06:12.960> quality

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
of minutes I know the capture quality

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.589 
of minutes I know the capture quality
isn't<00:06:13.500> fantastic<00:06:13.949> if<00:06:14.490> you<00:06:14.910> want<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.210> see<00:06:15.389> more

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
isn't fantastic if you want to see more
