of<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.720> few<00:01:31.020> chances<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.680> honest

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
of like really few chances to be honest

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
of like really few chances to be honest
here<00:01:32.369> jizzle<00:01:32.759> turns<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> gets<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> shot<00:01:33.750> off<00:01:33.780> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
here jizzle turns and gets a shot off in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
here jizzle turns and gets a shot off in
the<00:01:34.170> end<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> keeper<00:01:35.280> saves<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the end and I think the keeper saves it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120 
the end and I think the keeper saves it
and<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.600> can't<00:01:36.780> capitalize<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.650> move<00:01:37.829> but

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and we can't capitalize on the move but

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
and we can't capitalize on the move but
I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.119> only<00:01:39.210> two<00:01:39.479> chances<00:01:39.990> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I think there are only two chances in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.280 
I think there are only two chances in
the<00:01:40.229> opening<00:01:40.530> 40<00:01:40.979> minutes<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.549> game<00:01:41.640> so

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
the opening 40 minutes of this game so

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.840 
the opening 40 minutes of this game so
it<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:43.409> quite<00:01:43.530> balance<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> mainly<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it was quite balance of mainly a lot of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840 
it was quite balance of mainly a lot of
possession<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.740> 45th<00:01:46.740> minute<00:01:46.829> jizzle<00:01:47.640> works

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
possession and 45th minute jizzle works

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.389 
possession and 45th minute jizzle works
the<00:01:48.000> ball<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:49.470> Davies<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the ball into I think Davies that is and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.660 
the ball into I think Davies that is and
he<00:01:50.820> turns<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.450> gets<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.720> shot<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.670> yeah

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
he turns and gets a shot off and yeah

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.950 
he turns and gets a shot off and yeah
just<00:01:53.939> gives<00:01:54.299> us<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> lead<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.869> game

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
just gives us the lead in this game

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.420 
just gives us the lead in this game
round<00:01:55.439> half<00:01:55.560> times<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.310> good

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
round half times I was a really good

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550 
round half times I was a really good
time<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.759> us<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> score<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:58.020> second<00:01:58.409> half

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
time for us to score but I'm second half

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
time for us to score but I'm second half
we<00:01:58.740> were<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.250> lot<00:01:59.399> weaker<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.240> seems

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we were a lot weaker and then that seems

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.800 
we were a lot weaker and then that seems
to<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> recurring<00:02:01.700> sort<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.790> three<00:02:03.030> theme

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to be a recurring sort of three theme

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.890 
to be a recurring sort of three theme
with<00:02:04.049> them

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
with them

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.810 
with them
simple<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:05.800> there<00:02:05.980> is<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.160> worst<00:02:06.460> shot<00:02:06.670> your

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
simple and there is the worst shot your

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.850 
simple and there is the worst shot your
ever<00:02:07.030> sees<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.540> beautiful<00:02:08.020> pass<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.410> moving<00:02:08.800> he

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
ever sees a beautiful pass to moving he

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.010 
ever sees a beautiful pass to moving he
just<00:02:09.040> fired<00:02:09.250> away<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:10.030> like<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> said<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.600> week

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
just fired away but like I said the week

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.020 
just fired away but like I said the week
second<00:02:11.380> half<00:02:11.500> performances<00:02:12.070> as<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.490> recurring

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
second half performances as a recurring

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.750 
second half performances as a recurring
thing<00:02:13.240> right<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:14.020> Bolin<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:15.520> guess

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
thing right now for Bolin and I guess

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
thing right now for Bolin and I guess
Blackpool<00:02:16.120> kinda<00:02:16.360> came<00:02:16.600> back<00:02:16.750> at<00:02:16.900> us<00:02:17.020> and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
Blackpool kinda came back at us and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.440 
Blackpool kinda came back at us and
really<00:02:17.650> put<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.100> pressure<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.270> we

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
really put the pressure on and then we

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.880 
really put the pressure on and then we
get<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.630> chance<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.020> put<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.320> game<00:02:20.470> beyond<00:02:20.770> all

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
get a chance to put the game beyond all

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.680 
get a chance to put the game beyond all
doubt<00:02:21.040> hear<00:02:21.250> me<00:02:21.430> playing<00:02:21.730> through<00:02:22.000> Gutierrez

doubt hear me playing through Gutierrez

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.510 
doubt hear me playing through Gutierrez
like<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.320> said<00:02:23.380> he's<00:02:23.710> not<00:02:23.890> as<00:02:23.950> fast<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.460> as

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
like I said he's not as fast or as

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160 
like I said he's not as fast or as
strong<00:02:24.850> as<00:02:24.970> Brody<00:02:25.210> us<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.600> he<00:02:25.810> doesn't

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
strong as Brody us and he doesn't

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.990 
strong as Brody us and he doesn't
capitalize<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.890> chance<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> end

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
capitalize on that chance and in the end

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.060 
capitalize on that chance and in the end
we<00:02:28.060> do<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.540> punished<00:02:28.900> by<00:02:29.080> them<00:02:29.200> blackpool

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.850 
target update from a manager as you can
see<00:03:01.330> i<00:03:01.360> was<00:03:01.540> done<00:03:01.750> quite<00:03:01.930> well<00:03:01.959> getting<00:03:02.470> over

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
see i was done quite well getting over

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.800 
see i was done quite well getting over
the<00:03:02.980> effort<00:03:03.250> rate<00:03:03.430> required<00:03:03.760> scoring<00:03:04.600> three

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the effort rate required scoring three

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.360 
the effort rate required scoring three
times<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.110> amount<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.440> calls<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.740> also<00:03:06.100> be<00:03:06.250> in

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
times the amount of calls and also be in

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.440 
times the amount of calls and also be in
the<00:03:06.430> ghost<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.730> shot<00:03:06.880> conversion<00:03:07.330> percentage

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the ghost a shot conversion percentage

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.479 
the ghost a shot conversion percentage
so<00:03:08.290> that's<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.650> really<00:03:08.680> good<00:03:08.980> result<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:09.340> us

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
so that's a really good result for us

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.040 
so that's a really good result for us
but<00:03:09.910> over<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> next<00:03:10.300> four<00:03:10.630> games<00:03:10.660> we're

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
but over the next four games we're

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.900 
but over the next four games we're
setting<00:03:11.350> new<00:03:11.470> targets<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.160> an<00:03:12.370> avid<00:03:12.670> rate<00:03:12.790> of

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
setting new targets of an avid rate of

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.720 
setting new targets of an avid rate of
nine<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:14.110> goal<00:03:14.440> conversion<00:03:15.280> rate<00:03:15.489> of

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
nine and a goal conversion rate of

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.100 
nine and a goal conversion rate of
thirty<00:03:16.030> two<00:03:16.300> percent<00:03:16.330> which<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.720> quite<00:03:16.870> high

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
thirty two percent which is quite high

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.570 
thirty two percent which is quite high
as<00:03:17.290> well<00:03:17.440> as<00:03:17.590> scoring<00:03:17.860> two<00:03:17.980> goals<00:03:18.010> with<00:03:18.430> two

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580

girls<00:03:18.790> i<00:03:18.910> think<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.120> going<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.300> be<00:03:19.330> quite

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
girls i think is going to be quite

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.120 
girls i think is going to be quite
achievable<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.530> rest<00:03:20.739> might<00:03:20.920> prove

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
achievable but the rest might prove

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.920 
achievable but the rest might prove
tough<00:03:21.340> but<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:21.820> added<00:03:22.180> incentive<00:03:22.750> as

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
tough but it's added incentive as

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.810 
tough but it's added incentive as
