mod us so if you have an X in your hand

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.170 
mod us so if you have an X in your hand
and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.960> get<00:01:30.960> away<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.530> bottom<00:01:32.400> part<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and you just get away the bottom part of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.560 
and you just get away the bottom part of
the<00:01:33.329> tree<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:35.009> whole<00:01:35.549> tree<00:01:35.970> will<00:01:36.329> fall<00:01:36.360> down

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the tree the whole tree will fall down

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.700 
the tree the whole tree will fall down
so<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:38.189> only<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:38.909> away<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> blocks

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so it will only take away the blocks

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.819 
so it will only take away the blocks
above<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.000> leave<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.899> lowest<00:01:43.229> part<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
above so if you leave the lowest part it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.490 
above so if you leave the lowest part it
will<00:01:44.070> stay<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.820> should<00:01:45.329> always<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:46.470> sure

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you take away the lowest part and then

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.399 
you take away the lowest part and then
you<00:01:49.710> should<00:01:49.979> get<00:01:50.360> maximum<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.570> end<00:01:51.780> minimum

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.510 
maybe problem i found with this mod is
that<00:02:11.300> for<00:02:11.959> example<00:02:12.080> if<00:02:12.590> i<00:02:12.709> misplaced<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
that for example if i misplaced the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.180 
that for example if i misplaced the
smoke<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.390> block<00:02:14.780> here<00:02:15.110> on<00:02:15.349> my<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:15.920> house

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
smoke this block here on my little house

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.809 
smoke this block here on my little house
which<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.630> made<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.989> like<00:02:18.260> one<00:02:18.709> minute<00:02:18.950> not

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
which I just made in like one minute not

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.320 
which I just made in like one minute not
even<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:20.930> anyways<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.760> gotta<00:02:22.760> remove<00:02:23.150> it

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
even that but anyways I gotta remove it

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.840 
even that but anyways I gotta remove it
by<00:02:23.540> hand<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.260> not<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.770> whole<00:02:25.069> house<00:02:25.430> gets

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
by hand so not the whole house gets

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.770 
by hand so not the whole house gets
destroyed<00:02:26.300> because<00:02:26.540> i<00:02:27.790> think<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:28.940> i<00:02:29.120> take<00:02:29.540> away

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
destroyed because i think if i take away

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.620 
destroyed because i think if i take away
this<00:02:29.959> block<00:02:30.260> yeah<00:02:30.830> as<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.910> could<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.150> it's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
this block yeah as you could see it's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.979 
this block yeah as you could see it's
just<00:02:32.840> basically<00:02:33.650> takes<00:02:34.040> away<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.370> whole

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
just basically takes away the whole

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.770 
just basically takes away the whole
bunch<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.849> need<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.420> look<00:02:38.630> out

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
bunch of what so you need to look out

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.280 
bunch of what so you need to look out
for<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.110> also<00:02:39.800> something<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:41.290> connected

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
for that also something is connected

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.320 
for that also something is connected
with<00:02:42.319> leaves<00:02:42.920> i<00:02:43.220> guess<00:02:43.459> that's<00:02:43.730> how<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.000> mod

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
with leaves i guess that's how the mod

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.410 
with leaves i guess that's how the mod
works<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.590> should<00:02:45.890> also<00:02:46.220> cause<00:02:46.700> minor

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
works so this should also cause minor

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.110 
works so this should also cause minor
problems<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.980> need<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.310> careful<00:02:49.640> while

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
problems so you need to be careful while

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.720 
problems so you need to be careful while
working<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:50.989> houses<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.519> won't

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
working on your houses so this won't

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.449
