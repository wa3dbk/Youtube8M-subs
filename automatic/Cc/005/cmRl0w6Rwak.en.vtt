parts<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:14.000> pre-painting<00:05:15.000> other<00:05:15.780> than<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
parts of pre-painting other than the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.520 
parts of pre-painting other than the
taping<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.800> wiping<00:05:17.790> all<00:05:18.000> your<00:05:18.750> hand<00:05:19.260> and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
taping is wiping all your hand and

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.640 
taping is wiping all your hand and
paintball<00:05:20.220> oils<00:05:20.670> off<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.930> marker<00:05:22.290> because

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
paintball oils off of the marker because

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.510 
paintball oils off of the marker because
paint<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.340> not<00:05:23.520> going<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.880> stick<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.330> oil<00:05:24.570> so

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
paint is not going to stick the oil so

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.370 
paint is not going to stick the oil so
you<00:05:26.520> want<00:05:26.700> to<00:05:26.790> make<00:05:26.820> sure<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.780> all<00:05:27.810> your<00:05:28.080> hand

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
you want to make sure that all your hand

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.140 
you want to make sure that all your hand
oils<00:05:28.800> and

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
oils and

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.500 
oils and
paintball<00:05:32.150> oil<00:05:32.420> and<00:05:32.630> lube<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:34.160> all<00:05:34.520> off<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
paintball oil and lube is all off of the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.760 
paintball oil and lube is all off of the
paint<00:05:35.810> of<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.050> gun<00:05:36.670> because<00:05:38.260> our<00:05:39.260> new<00:05:39.470> paint

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
paint of the gun because our new paint

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.240 
paint of the gun because our new paint
won't<00:05:40.040> stick<00:05:40.190> to<00:05:40.580> it<00:05:40.730> so<00:05:42.070> want<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:43.130> make<00:05:43.220> sure

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
won't stick to it so want to make sure

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.550 
won't stick to it so want to make sure
there's<00:05:43.580> not<00:05:43.730> on<00:05:43.910> there<00:05:44.230> sometimes<00:05:45.230> I

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
there's not on there sometimes I

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.070 
there's not on there sometimes I
actually<00:05:46.040> take<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.490> little<00:05:46.700> bit<00:05:46.910> of<00:05:47.080> scotch

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
actually take a little bit of scotch

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.780 
actually take a little bit of scotch
brite<00:05:48.350> which<00:05:48.860> is<00:05:49.040> kind<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:49.430> sandpaper

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
brite which is kind of like sandpaper

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.900 
brite which is kind of like sandpaper
but<00:05:50.150> not<00:05:50.300> really<00:05:50.480> scotch<00:05:50.990> brite<00:05:51.230> and<00:05:51.730> rough<00:05:52.730> up

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
but not really scotch brite and rough up

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.510 
but not really scotch brite and rough up
the<00:05:53.090> old<00:05:53.210> paint<00:05:53.420> job<00:05:53.690> I<00:05:53.960> don't<00:05:54.950> think<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.280> need

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
the old paint job I don't think I need

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.640 
the old paint job I don't think I need
to<00:05:55.550> because<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.330> anodizing<00:05:56.840> on<00:05:57.140> this<00:05:57.290> one<00:05:57.470> is

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
to because the anodizing on this one is

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.690 
to because the anodizing on this one is
very<00:05:57.830> porous<00:05:58.370> so<00:05:59.060> it'll<00:05:59.390> give<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.570> good<00:05:59.810> footing

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
very porous so it'll give a good footing

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.210 
very porous so it'll give a good footing
then<00:06:01.700> he<00:06:01.790> paint<00:06:02.090> I'm<00:06:02.270> sure<00:06:02.540> that's<00:06:03.260> not<00:06:03.440> and

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
then he paint I'm sure that's not and

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.030 
then he paint I'm sure that's not and
from<00:06:04.640> here<00:06:04.700> on<00:06:05.060> you<00:06:05.720> don't<00:06:06.230> really<00:06:06.620> want<00:06:06.920> to

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
from here on you don't really want to

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.310 
from here on you don't really want to
touch<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:08.120> glove<00:06:08.420> with<00:06:08.660> your<00:06:08.840> bare<00:06:08.990> hands

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
touch the glove with your bare hands

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.870 
touch the glove with your bare hands
because<00:06:10.310> your<00:06:10.580> hands<00:06:10.790> are<00:06:10.970> oily<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:12.700> the<00:06:13.700> gun

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
because your hands are oily and the gun

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.710 
because your hands are oily and the gun
is<00:06:14.060> not<00:06:14.240> so

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.950 

a<00:06:22.840> little<00:06:23.500> something<00:06:23.680> like<00:06:23.890> that<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:27.960> I'll

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
a little something like that and I'll

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.200 
a little something like that and I'll
lay<00:06:29.170> out<00:06:29.200> the<00:06:29.470> paper<00:06:29.710> here<00:06:30.070> so<00:06:30.760> I<00:06:30.820> can<00:06:30.910> spray

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
lay out the paper here so I can spray

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.300 
lay out the paper here so I can spray
the<00:06:31.360> gun<00:06:31.890> but<00:06:32.890> before<00:06:33.070> I<00:06:33.280> do<00:06:33.400> that<00:06:35.160> I'm<00:06:36.160> going

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
the gun but before I do that I'm going

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.700 
the gun but before I do that I'm going
to<00:06:36.400> show<00:06:36.520> you<00:06:36.610> what<00:06:36.760> this<00:06:36.880> is<00:06:36.940> for<00:06:37.240> alright<00:06:38.140> so

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
to show you what this is for alright so

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.870 
to show you what this is for alright so
I've<00:06:39.640> cut<00:06:39.850> myself<00:06:40.030> out<00:06:40.450> piece<00:06:40.840> of<00:06:41.110> cardboard

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
I've cut myself out piece of cardboard

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.670 
I've cut myself out piece of cardboard
I'm<00:06:42.880> eating<00:06:43.240> Froot<00:06:43.510> Loops<00:06:43.540> box<00:06:43.990> you<00:06:44.350> can<00:06:44.500> use

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
I'm eating Froot Loops box you can use

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.700 
I'm eating Froot Loops box you can use
whatever<00:06:44.830> you<00:06:45.070> want<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:46.780> make<00:06:46.930> more<00:06:47.200> permanent

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
whatever you want to make more permanent

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.830 
whatever you want to make more permanent
stencil<00:06:48.160> sometimes<00:06:48.640> i<00:06:48.760> use<00:06:48.840> overhead

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
stencil sometimes i use overhead

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.000 
stencil sometimes i use overhead
projector<00:06:50.410> plastic<00:06:51.280> sheets<00:06:52.770> because<00:06:53.770> then

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
projector plastic sheets because then

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.390 
projector plastic sheets because then
it's<00:06:54.130> more<00:06:54.250> permanent<00:06:54.700> but<00:06:55.890> for<00:06:56.890> a<00:06:56.920> temporary

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
it's more permanent but for a temporary

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.020 
it's more permanent but for a temporary
job<00:06:57.720> this<00:06:58.720> will<00:06:58.930> be<00:06:59.020> fine<00:06:59.520> basically<00:07:00.520> this<00:07:00.970> is

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
job this will be fine basically this is

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.620 
job this will be fine basically this is
in<00:07:01.270> VR<00:07:01.630> stencil<00:07:02.290> and<00:07:02.790> the<00:07:03.790> stencil<00:07:04.270> is<00:07:04.360> very

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
in VR stencil and the stencil is very

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:12.720 
in VR stencil and the stencil is very
simple<00:07:05.040> so<00:07:06.210> try<00:07:07.210> not<00:07:07.240> to<00:07:07.510> lose<00:07:07.660> me<00:07:07.930> here<00:07:11.730> so

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
simple so try not to lose me here so

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.870 
simple so try not to lose me here so
basically<00:07:13.240> that's<00:07:13.720> what<00:07:13.900> we're<00:07:14.140> cutting<00:07:14.410> out

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
basically that's what we're cutting out

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.150 
basically that's what we're cutting out
take<00:07:15.880> your<00:07:16.000> exacto<00:07:16.540> blade<00:07:16.570> and<00:07:17.160> they're

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
take your exacto blade and they're

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.520 
take your exacto blade and they're
basically<00:07:19.000> giant<00:07:19.540> esas<00:07:19.960> with<00:07:20.950> tapered<00:07:21.370> ends

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
basically giant esas with tapered ends

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.290 
basically giant esas with tapered ends
this<00:07:23.530> is<00:07:23.770> not<00:07:23.950> that<00:07:24.190> important<00:07:24.790> believe<00:07:25.120> me

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
this is not that important believe me

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.020 
this is not that important believe me
it'll<00:07:25.450> look<00:07:25.660> good<00:07:25.900> even<00:07:26.200> if<00:07:26.500> you<00:07:26.850> don't<00:07:27.850> do

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
it'll look good even if you don't do

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.909 
it'll look good even if you don't do
this<00:07:28.210> very<00:07:28.270> well<00:07:29.970> so<00:07:31.410> that<00:07:32.410> was<00:07:32.560> pretty<00:07:32.710> much

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
this very well so that was pretty much

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.580 
this very well so that was pretty much
the<00:07:32.980> pattern<00:07:33.430> you<00:07:33.520> want<00:07:33.640> to<00:07:33.760> follow<00:07:34.530> try<00:07:35.530> to

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 
the pattern you want to follow try to

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.990 
the pattern you want to follow try to
recreate<00:07:36.040> that<00:07:37.590> cut<00:07:38.590> the<00:07:39.130> intersections<00:07:39.820> out

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
recreate that cut the intersections out

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.290 
recreate that cut the intersections out
and<00:07:40.240> you'll<00:07:40.930> have<00:07:41.050> your<00:07:41.110> stencil<00:07:41.820> all<00:07:42.820> right<00:07:43.090> I

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.300 
and you'll have your stencil all right I

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.590 
and you'll have your stencil all right I
have<00:07:44.250> cut<00:07:45.250> it<00:07:45.280> out<00:07:45.490> as<00:07:46.450> you<00:07:46.570> can<00:07:46.780> see<00:07:48.300> you<00:07:49.300> don't

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:49.600 
have cut it out as you can see you don't

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.420 
have cut it out as you can see you don't
have<00:07:49.780> to<00:07:49.900> be<00:07:50.020> perfect<00:07:50.229> as<00:07:50.650> you<00:07:50.830> can<00:07:50.979> see<00:07:51.190> it

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.430 
have to be perfect as you can see it
