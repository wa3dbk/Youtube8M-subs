I<00:00:43.600> put<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:43.929> brick<00:00:44.170> block<00:00:44.679> there<00:00:44.979> when<00:00:45.370> you're

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:45.549 
I put that brick block there when you're

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:50.039 
I put that brick block there when you're
on<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.140> those<00:00:48.179> moving<00:00:49.179> pads<00:00:49.390> you<00:00:49.659> can't<00:00:49.899> get

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
on the those moving pads you can't get

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.639 
on the those moving pads you can't get
past<00:00:50.289> you<00:00:50.949> can't<00:00:51.189> go<00:00:51.339> to<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.519> right<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:53.500> a

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
past you can't go to the right it's a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.920 
past you can't go to the right it's a
glitch<00:00:53.859> in<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.100> game<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.549> I<00:00:54.699> found<00:00:55.000> out

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.479 

all<00:00:59.930> right<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:00.170> like<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.130> know<00:01:01.310> it's<00:01:01.430> a

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
all right I like it you know it's a

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:10.870 
all right I like it you know it's a
small<00:01:01.790> map<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:03.400> think<00:01:04.400> it's<00:01:04.550> pretty<00:01:04.670> cool

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.670 

get<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.060> help

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.660 

either

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:39.679 

pretty<00:01:27.670> basic<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.079> fact<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.829> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:02:06.210 

yep

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.470 

there's<00:02:07.220> not<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> lot<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.790> say<00:02:12.130> it's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there's not a lot to say it's

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:36.350 
there's not a lot to say it's
just<00:02:14.080> below<00:02:14.349> oh<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:17.530> was<00:02:17.680> lucky

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:46.750 

guess<00:02:37.360> we'll<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.570> fight

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.369 

yeah<00:02:47.760> there's<00:02:47.970> no<00:02:48.120> particular<00:02:48.510> reason<00:02:49.019> why<00:02:49.349> i

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
yeah there's no particular reason why i

00:02:49.379 --> 00:03:03.080 
yeah there's no particular reason why i
chose<00:02:49.940> chose<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.120> music<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:53.280> i<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:54.959> did

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:25.000 

Oh

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.630 

same<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.400> music<00:03:26.730> but<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.180> techno<00:03:27.690> and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
same kind of music but it's techno and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.009 
same kind of music but it's techno and
my<00:03:29.640> choice<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:29.909> Tetris<00:03:33.110> for<00:03:34.110> obvious<00:03:34.500> reasons

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
my choice is Tetris for obvious reasons

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.899 
my choice is Tetris for obvious reasons
and<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.129> this<00:03:38.250> level<00:03:38.579> because<00:03:38.730> it's

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
and I like this level because it's

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.369 
and I like this level because it's
really<00:03:39.480> big

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.780 

and<00:03:44.379> it<00:03:44.530> has<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:45.040> lot<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.790> different<00:03:47.790> places

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
and it has a lot of different places

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.550 
and it has a lot of different places
where<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.719> can<00:03:49.870> fight

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.050 

no<00:03:53.069> like<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.760> lot<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.440> things<00:03:55.440> though<00:03:56.060> hopefully

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
no like a lot of things though hopefully

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:08.080 
no like a lot of things though hopefully
it's<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.840> basic<00:03:58.500> room<00:03:58.770> let's<00:03:59.760> just<00:04:00.150> go

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.250 

I<00:04:09.129> i<00:04:10.129> use<00:04:10.430> this<00:04:10.670> music<00:04:11.150> because<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.959> seemed

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
I i use this music because it seemed

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.490 
I i use this music because it seemed
hard<00:04:12.760> video<00:04:13.760> games<00:04:14.030> than<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.690> actual<00:04:14.840> tetris

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
hard video games than the actual tetris

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:42.350 
hard video games than the actual tetris
music<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:20.680> that's<00:04:21.680> really<00:04:22.130> is<00:04:22.960> why

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.409 

it's<00:04:43.360> hard<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.229> explain<00:04:44.530> but<00:04:44.949> this<00:04:45.820> kind<00:04:46.300> of

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
it's hard to explain but this kind of

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:56.580 
it's hard to explain but this kind of
the<00:04:46.539> layout<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.320> lower<00:04:54.840> but<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.380> just

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
the layout of the lower but it's just

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.480 
the layout of the lower but it's just
walks<00:04:57.400> in<00:04:57.729> shape<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.509> Tetris<00:04:59.320> cause<00:05:01.080> i<00:05:02.340> mean<00:05:03.340> if

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
walks in shape of Tetris cause i mean if

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.730 
walks in shape of Tetris cause i mean if
you've<00:05:03.639> ever<00:05:03.820> played<00:05:04.120> pinterest<00:05:04.740> nowhere

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
you've ever played pinterest nowhere

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:16.580 
you've ever played pinterest nowhere
else<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.830> they're<00:05:08.830> kind<00:05:08.949> of<00:05:09.100> evenly<00:05:09.400> spread

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:26.499 

this<00:05:17.590> is<00:05:17.800> really<00:05:17.979> effective

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.950 

again<00:05:27.509> not<00:05:27.900> much<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.290> say<00:05:28.500> but<00:05:29.750> I'll<00:05:30.750> just

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
again not much to say but I'll just

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.500 
again not much to say but I'll just
fight<00:05:31.169> for<00:05:31.500> now

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:49.350 

you

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.540 

music<00:05:50.360> doesn't<00:05:50.539> really<00:05:50.779> fit<00:05:51.169> but<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.979> mean<00:05:52.339> it

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
music doesn't really fit but I mean it

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:08.380 
music doesn't really fit but I mean it
was<00:05:54.729> it<00:05:55.729> was<00:05:55.909> like<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:57.080> best<00:05:57.289> one

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:20.830 

oh<00:06:15.940> I<00:06:16.940> think<00:06:18.550> hmm<00:06:19.550> i<00:06:19.730> think<00:06:19.850> we<00:06:20.120> will<00:06:20.150> died<00:06:20.510> but

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
oh I think hmm i think we will died but

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.640 
oh I think hmm i think we will died but
well<00:06:21.830> that's<00:06:22.280> really<00:06:23.060> it<00:06:23.300> that's<00:06:24.170> all<00:06:24.410> i<00:06:24.440> have

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
well that's really it that's all i have

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.120 
well that's really it that's all i have
to<00:06:24.740> say<00:06:25.750> yes<00:06:26.750> i'll<00:06:27.670> see<00:06:28.670> you<00:06:28.760> next<00:06:28.820> time
