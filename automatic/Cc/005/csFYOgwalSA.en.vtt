00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.260 

so<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.680> thought<00:00:01.920> it<00:00:02.070> would<00:00:02.129> be<00:00:02.280> helpful<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.970> show

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
so I thought it would be helpful to show

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.420 
so I thought it would be helpful to show
a<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.570> bit<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.840> shading<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.279> do

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
a little bit of shading that I do

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
closed toe shoes like a more closed up

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
don't really need a lot of shading but

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.359 
don't really need a lot of shading but
on<00:00:17.970> sandals<00:00:18.810> especially<00:00:19.500> strappy<00:00:19.920> sandals

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
on sandals especially strappy sandals

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.410 
on sandals especially strappy sandals
you're<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> need<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.240> bit<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you're going to need a little bit of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.939 
you're going to need a little bit of
shading<00:00:21.689> okay<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.160> said<00:00:23.220> before<00:00:24.920> what<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
shading okay so as I said before what I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.019 
shading okay so as I said before what I
do<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.789> take<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:29.220> o2<00:00:29.640> pen

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
do is I take a little bit of my o2 pen

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.479 
do is I take a little bit of my o2 pen
and<00:00:30.710> when<00:00:31.710> two<00:00:31.980> straps<00:00:32.430> cross<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:34.500> put<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and when two straps cross I put just a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.990 
and when two straps cross I put just a
little<00:00:35.520> bit<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.540> extra<00:00:37.100> ink<00:00:38.100> right<00:00:38.670> there

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
little bit of extra ink right there

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.280 
little bit of extra ink right there
where<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.360> cross<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.530> bottom<00:00:40.860> strap<00:00:41.219> so

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
where they cross on the bottom strap so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
where they cross on the bottom strap so
it<00:00:43.290> gives<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> dimension<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it gives a little bit of dimension to it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.830 
it gives a little bit of dimension to it
like<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.660> saying<00:00:45.719> before<00:00:47.510> I'm<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> do

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
i also do it at the buckle just a little
bit<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> strep<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> buckle<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

bit on the strep before the buckle and
after<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> buckle<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:07.619> actually<00:01:08.040> even<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
after the buckle and actually even a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
after the buckle and actually even a
little<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:12.950> where

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
little bit here and a little here where

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
little bit here and a little here where
the<00:01:14.159> straps<00:01:14.659> overlap<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> already<00:01:19.590> tell

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the straps overlap you can already tell

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.940 
the straps overlap you can already tell
it's<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> popping<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> bit<00:01:21.540> more

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
it's just kind of popping out a bit more

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's just kind of popping out a bit more
I<00:01:22.950> also<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.570> time<00:01:24.979> where<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I also like to if I have time where the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.210 
I also like to if I have time where the
straps<00:01:26.490> meet<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.180> insole<00:01:27.659> board<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.259> put<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
straps meet the insole board I put a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.120 
straps meet the insole board I put a
little<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.820> under<00:01:30.479> each<00:01:30.720> strap<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.979> on

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
little bit under each strap so not on

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
little bit under each strap so not on
the<00:01:32.280> strap<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> insole<00:01:33.270> board<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.810> put

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the strap put on the insole board I put

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
the strap put on the insole board I put
a<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:36.450> show<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.840> these<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.140> two

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a little bit to show that these are two

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.070 
a little bit to show that these are two
separate<00:01:37.650> pieces<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.640> overlapping

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080 

it's<00:01:44.650> not<00:01:44.860> necessary<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:45.880> just

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
it's not necessary but it's just

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.910 
it's not necessary but it's just
something<00:01:46.540> extra<00:01:46.990> that'll<00:01:47.320> make<00:01:47.530> them<00:01:47.680> pop

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
something extra that'll make them pop

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.110 
something extra that'll make them pop
out<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.090> that's<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.450> for<00:01:52.510> this<00:01:52.750> one<00:01:53.940> now<00:01:54.940> I'm

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
out so that's it for this one now I'm

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.060 
out so that's it for this one now I'm
going<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:56.760> we<00:01:57.760> already<00:01:57.910> did<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.890> we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
going to we already did this one so we

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.740 
going to we already did this one so we
again<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:01.210> would<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.540> under<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.230> strap<00:02:02.920> here

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
again we would do under the strap here

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.320 
again we would do under the strap here
we<00:02:04.750> would<00:02:04.930> do<00:02:05.140> all<00:02:05.410> of<00:02:05.440> these<00:02:05.800> pieces<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:07.240> are

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
we would do all of these pieces that are

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.560 
we would do all of these pieces that are
on<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> inside<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.320> shoe<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:09.570> actually

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
on the inside of the shoe and actually

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.860 
on the inside of the shoe and actually
you<00:02:10.690> would<00:02:10.840> add<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.020> little<00:02:11.320> bit<00:02:11.530> more<00:02:12.870> where

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
you would add a little bit more where

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.100 
you would add a little bit more where
the<00:02:13.990> straps<00:02:14.290> meet<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.710> insole<00:02:15.100> again<00:02:16.110> here

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
the straps meet the insole again here

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
the straps meet the insole again here
and<00:02:17.350> here<00:02:17.710> i<00:02:20.940> think<00:02:21.940> that's<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.300> also<00:02:23.940> what<00:02:24.940> i

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and here i think that's it also what i

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.150 
and here i think that's it also what i
do<00:02:25.090> just<00:02:25.570> for<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.840> little<00:02:26.050> bit<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.440> dimension<00:02:26.620> is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
do just for a little bit of dimension is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.060 
do just for a little bit of dimension is
that<00:02:27.970> when<00:02:28.390> there's<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.200> heel<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.890> you're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
that when there's a heel and you're

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.800 
that when there's a heel and you're
drawing<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:30.580> 3d<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.300> rest<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.660> them<00:02:31.780> I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
drawing it in 3d the rest of them I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.040 
drawing it in 3d the rest of them I

okay I'm copywriting this because it's a
pretty<00:03:31.540> cool<00:03:31.780> idea<00:03:31.959> as<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.980> was<00:03:33.130> inking<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.090> in

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
pretty cool idea as I was inking this in

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300 
pretty cool idea as I was inking this in
I<00:03:34.540> thought<00:03:34.780> wouldn't<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.290> be<00:03:35.500> cool<00:03:35.739> if<00:03:35.800> this

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
I thought wouldn't that be cool if this

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.449 
I thought wouldn't that be cool if this
wasn't<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:37.000> complete<00:03:37.989> wedge<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.130> just<00:03:39.340> a

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
wasn't a complete wedge if it was just a

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.199 
wasn't a complete wedge if it was just a
heel<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.120> then<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.590> Rope<00:03:41.830> kind<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:42.910> kind

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
heel and then the Rope kind of just kind

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.449 
heel and then the Rope kind of just kind
of<00:03:43.330> went<00:03:43.540> over<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.930> heel<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.320> give<00:03:44.500> an<00:03:44.739> idea<00:03:44.860> of

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
of went over the heel to give an idea of

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.160 
of went over the heel to give an idea of
an<00:03:45.580> espadrille<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.330> it's<00:03:46.450> really<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> heel

be

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.310 
be
because<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:57.790> intricate<00:03:58.180> as<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.870> that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
because it's so intricate as it is that

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.740 
because it's so intricate as it is that
if<00:03:59.620> you<00:04:00.100> went<00:04:00.310> in<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.580> would<00:04:00.700> just<00:04:00.820> be<00:04:01.030> way<00:04:01.690> too

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
just gets it a bit more dimension than

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.800 
just gets it a bit more dimension than
it<00:04:40.990> would<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.140> had<00:04:41.350> before<00:04:45.450> just<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.600> little
