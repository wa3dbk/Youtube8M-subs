base model and with a softer ride and
less<00:04:14.100> braking<00:04:14.519> it's<00:04:14.700> fine<00:04:15.120> for<00:04:15.329> cruising<00:04:15.690> but

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
less braking it's fine for cruising but

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.170 
less braking it's fine for cruising but
