00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.270
 who have mobilized such a revolution 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.070
 inside me that I had to get it out of 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.530
 some way and this is the way in 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.030
 that I can express all that passion 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.850
 What I have inside Peru is 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.300
 incredible I travel a lot the interior 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.259

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.259
 I know where to start 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.299
 if we are going to surprise you with your collection 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.219

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 day in life and for the clothes they wore 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.350
