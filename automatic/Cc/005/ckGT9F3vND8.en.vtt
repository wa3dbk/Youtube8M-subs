00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
hours which is really fast and so we

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
hours which is really fast and so we
basically<00:01:48.540> had<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.290> leveler<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.979> each<00:01:50.100> class

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

pretty<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.509> didn't<00:01:51.840> matter<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.710> zone<00:01:52.950> they

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.219 
started in but came up with a chart
right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:59.479> overall<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:01.170> pretty

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
right here and overall it's pretty

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.679 
right here and overall it's pretty
interesting<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.130> gore's<00:02:02.689> alliance

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
