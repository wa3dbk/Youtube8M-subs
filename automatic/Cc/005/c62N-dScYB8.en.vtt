00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:03.380
 to somalia pike 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.850
 and I'm addicted 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.599
 in another impasse 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.599
 54 days 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.549
 I also want to talk 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.699
 give my testimony 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.239
 It was my father who brought me here. 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.409
 He said he would stay 30 days. 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.339
 I was deceived 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.609
 hospitalization is good 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 five months 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.990
 I 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.790
 I started smoking marijuana at age 12 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.340
 hence the alcohol 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.730
 cocaine 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.130
 and at 22 years of birth 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.400
 It was when I signed my sentence. 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.670
 in Tokyo 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.080
 three months and six days 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.350
 it's mine 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.800
 7th hospitalization 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 the others were in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 evangelical communities 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.080
 these places I could not even stop to think about life. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 It was just working with a dead person. 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.690
 now I have time to think about it 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.540
 I already read several books. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.620
 I miss my dogs 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.920
 out there she owns a truck 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 he worked as instruments for this 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.160
 joÃ£o person learning more 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
 here is what I miss most about my dogs 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 in that part 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.970
 I'll miss my horse later. 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 the lancenet 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.800
 of friends 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
 in my father's hand 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.910
 that's why when I left here 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.320
 I hope to get back very well from my dogs. 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 the my work button 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 sorry 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.340
 industry wants more 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.340
 the expectation of leaving and did not exist 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.059
 here it is easier to feel like drugging 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.779
 I think it's because he 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.139
 the boy lives 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 it's near a kart mouth 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.599
 so when I leave 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.599
 I hope you get on well with everything I have out there. 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.979
 I thought the bottom of the pit 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.369
 and I do not want it because 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.579
 so I will continue with the follow-up of a psychologist 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 my family structured to help 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.939
 we want here 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.969
 since 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.969
 let's go 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:55.589
 in 2010
