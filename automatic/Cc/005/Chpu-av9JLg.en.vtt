suppose<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.799> could<00:03:10.980> build<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.459> red<00:03:11.730> ray<00:03:12.000> what

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
suppose you could build a red ray what

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.120 
suppose you could build a red ray what
is<00:03:12.660> red<00:03:13.019> way<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.410> can<00:03:13.560> counteract<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
is red way you can counteract the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.590 
is red way you can counteract the
