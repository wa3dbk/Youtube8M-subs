and learn a little bit more about how we
can<00:00:53.160> become<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.670> safer<00:00:54.239> pilot<00:00:54.809> while<00:00:55.379> flying

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
can become a safer pilot while flying

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.510 
can become a safer pilot while flying
better<00:00:56.750> crosswind<00:00:57.750> landings

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:58.499 
to a great crosswind landing know where

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:03.319 
to a great crosswind landing know where
your<00:03:58.650> wind<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.340> coming<00:03:59.760> from<00:04:00.590> use<00:04:01.590> less<00:04:02.459> flaps

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
your wind is coming from use less flaps

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.190 
your wind is coming from use less flaps
thus<00:04:04.260> giving<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.950> more<00:04:05.840> airspeed<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.989> have

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
thus giving you more airspeed to have

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.539 
thus giving you more airspeed to have
greater<00:04:07.650> command<00:04:08.340> over<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:09.000> aircraft<00:04:09.299> and

greater command over that aircraft and
work<00:04:11.549> on<00:04:11.760> your<00:04:11.879> transition<00:04:12.719> from<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.499> crab

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
work on your transition from that crab

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.430 
work on your transition from that crab
to<00:04:14.609> that<00:04:14.790> side<00:04:15.180> slip<00:04:15.629> going<00:04:15.900> from<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.139> crab
