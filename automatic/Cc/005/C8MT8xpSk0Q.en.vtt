the window configuration that we went

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.929 
the window configuration that we went
with<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.310> by<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.460> way<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.820> are

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
with here and by the way there are

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.359 
with here and by the way there are
several<00:02:06.180> configurations<00:02:07.110> available<00:02:08.099> as<00:02:08.220> well

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
several configurations available as well

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 
several configurations available as well
as<00:02:08.550> different<00:02:08.879> window<00:02:09.179> sizes<00:02:09.800> we've<00:02:10.800> got<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
as different window sizes we've got a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.700 
as different window sizes we've got a
stationary<00:02:11.670> Center<00:02:12.209> pane<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.690> glass<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
stationary Center pane of glass here

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.980 
stationary Center pane of glass here
and<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> outside<00:02:14.100> panes<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.300> glass<00:02:15.360> actually

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and the outside panes of glass actually

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.070 
and the outside panes of glass actually
slide<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:18.060> idea<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.810> concept

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
slide in so this idea or this concept

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.520 
slide in so this idea or this concept
could<00:02:19.890> be<00:02:19.950> an<00:02:20.340> order<00:02:21.060> window<00:02:21.420> here<00:02:21.840> pickup

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
could be an order window here pickup

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.950 
could be an order window here pickup
window<00:02:22.710> there<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:24.000> glass<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.570> screens<00:02:24.840> on

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
window there the glass and screens on

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.020 
window there the glass and screens on
this<00:02:25.080> particular<00:02:25.380> model<00:02:25.770> are<00:02:26.220> incorporated

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
this particular model are incorporated

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
this particular model are incorporated
together<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.900> open<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> glass<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
together so you open up the glass and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.690 
together so you open up the glass and
here<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.490> have<00:02:29.640> screens<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.810> outside<00:02:31.700> so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
here you have screens on the outside so

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.280 
here you have screens on the outside so
if<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.910> party<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> serving<00:02:33.900> side<00:02:34.140> of

the extension cord if 15a motor base
plug<00:02:51.270> gears<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.810> what<00:02:51.900> powers<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
plug gears actually what powers the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.660 
plug gears actually what powers the
trailers<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:52.830> give<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.190> electrical

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
trailers we give you this electrical

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.270 
trailers we give you this electrical
cord<00:02:53.910> plug<00:02:54.660> into<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.050> side<00:02:55.260> twist<00:02:55.650> lock<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.130> in

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
cord plug into the side twist lock it in

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
cord plug into the side twist lock it in
and<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:57.000> powers<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.300> rest<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.750> trailer

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and it powers the rest of the trailer

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.320 
and it powers the rest of the trailer
now<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> reason<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.160> put<00:02:59.400> all<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.090> these

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
now the reason that we put all of these

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.820 
now the reason that we put all of these
items<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.020> side<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> trailer<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.710> you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
items on this side of the trailer so you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.190 
items on this side of the trailer so you
don't<00:03:02.100> want<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.150> line<00:03:03.720> full<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.080> people

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
don't want to have a line full of people

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200 
don't want to have a line full of people
giving<00:03:04.830> money<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.340> giving<00:03:05.700> orders<00:03:06.030> and

giving money and giving orders and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.690 
giving money and giving orders and
whatnot<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.900> also<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.650> electrical<00:03:08.250> cords

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
whatnot and also have electrical cords

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.180 
whatnot and also have electrical cords
and<00:03:08.880> water<00:03:09.060> tanks<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.570> fill<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.200> empty<00:03:10.680> and
