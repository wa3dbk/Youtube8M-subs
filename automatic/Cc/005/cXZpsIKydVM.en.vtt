00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
this layer again which was this layer

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.009 
this layer again which was this layer
actually<00:03:04.419> why<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:05.049> not<00:03:05.290> using<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:06.099> layer

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
actually why I'm not using this layer

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.059 
actually why I'm not using this layer
because<00:03:08.019> if<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.410> use<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:10.169> it<00:03:11.169> will<00:03:11.440> not<00:03:11.650> give<00:03:11.919> me

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
because if I use it it will not give me

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.920 
because if I use it it will not give me
the<00:03:12.099> option<00:03:12.579> of<00:03:12.849> bulb<00:03:13.150> here<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> can't

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
the option of bulb here so I can't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.059 
the option of bulb here so I can't
adjust<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.230> better<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:18.010> put<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.489> light<00:03:20.069> that

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
adjust it better to put this light that

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.300 
adjust it better to put this light that
fan<00:03:21.340> using<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.239> one<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.630> again<00:03:26.019> we<00:03:26.290> use<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
fan using this one so again we use the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:38.840 
fan using this one so again we use the
same<00:03:27.549> process<00:03:30.090> now<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.150> upper<00:03:31.630> part
