00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
think you know it's coming back to me a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.179 
think you know it's coming back to me a
little<00:02:02.180> bit<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:02.659> it's<00:02:03.110> trying<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.530> do<00:02:03.829> my<00:02:03.950> best

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
little bit so it's trying to do my best

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.240 
little bit so it's trying to do my best
i<00:02:04.310> guess<00:02:04.490> not<00:02:05.210> an<00:02:05.390> easy<00:02:05.509> game<00:02:05.840> no<00:02:06.740> it's<00:02:06.890> not<00:02:06.950> you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
i guess not an easy game no it's not you

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.590 
i guess not an easy game no it's not you
know<00:02:07.280> especially<00:02:07.460> now<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.329> guys<00:02:08.570> are

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
know especially now and the guys are

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.810 
know especially now and the guys are
sometimes<00:02:09.289> making<00:02:09.679> bad<00:02:10.009> decisions<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.700> know

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
sometimes making bad decisions you know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.789 
sometimes making bad decisions you know
it's<00:02:11.000> not<00:02:11.090> real<00:02:11.299> money<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:11.810> i<00:02:12.049> think<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:12.650> it's

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
it's not real money so i think if it's

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.170 
it's not real money so i think if it's
real<00:02:12.980> money<00:02:13.220> will<00:02:13.400> be<00:02:13.489> totally<00:02:13.760> different<00:02:13.820> i

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
real money will be totally different i

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.020 
real money will be totally different i
was<00:02:14.540> playing<00:02:14.840> for<00:02:15.019> long<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:16.030> started

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
was playing for long and then started

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.060 
was playing for long and then started
losing<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.630> then<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.959> know<00:02:18.079> you<00:02:18.709> gotta<00:02:18.890> know

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
losing and then you know you gotta know

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.830 
losing and then you know you gotta know
when<00:02:19.280> when<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.820> hold<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.359> went<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.660> leave

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
when when to hold on and went to leave

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.690 
when when to hold on and went to leave
so<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.440> know<00:02:21.650> bottom<00:02:21.890> line<00:02:21.980> was<00:02:22.280> i<00:02:22.459> had<00:02:22.609> to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
so you know bottom line was i had to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.030 
so you know bottom line was i had to
leave<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.910> table

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.800 

so<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.969> year<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.180> wanted<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.480> keep<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.689> little

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so this year I wanted to keep a little

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.670 
so this year I wanted to keep a little
more<00:02:32.110> conservative<00:02:32.439> and<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:34.540> when<00:02:35.439> I<00:02:35.469> have

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
more conservative and but when I have

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.110 
more conservative and but when I have
the<00:02:35.799> tux<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.219> kind<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.549> got<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.700> edge<00:02:36.879> for<00:02:37.090> a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the tux on I kind of got the edge for a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.390 
the tux on I kind of got the edge for a
little<00:02:37.239> wrinkle<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:37.810> Hugo<00:02:38.769> Boss<00:02:39.010> hooked<00:02:39.280> it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
little wrinkle and Hugo Boss hooked it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.130 
little wrinkle and Hugo Boss hooked it
up<00:02:39.459> with<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> little<00:02:40.030> pocket<00:02:40.450> square<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.079> then

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
think they had a lot a nice little touch

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.179 
think they had a lot a nice little touch
ya<00:02:46.989> blue<00:02:47.260> velvet<00:02:47.680> or<00:02:47.799> something<00:02:48.069> like<00:02:48.129> that

ya blue velvet or something like that

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.460 
ya blue velvet or something like that
right<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:49.450> only<00:02:49.569> didn't<00:02:49.780> really<00:02:49.959> match<00:02:50.200> his

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
right it only didn't really match his

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.960 
right it only didn't really match his
outfit<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.400> don't<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.730> what<00:02:51.849> he's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
outfit so I don't know what he's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.250

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
conversation going on I boilers going to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.450 
conversation going on I boilers going to
take<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> lot<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.690> heat<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.020> those<00:03:03.170> shoes<00:03:03.470> souls

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
take a lot of heat for those shoes souls

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.160 
take a lot of heat for those shoes souls
he's<00:03:04.670> never<00:03:04.850> really<00:03:05.030> had<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> great<00:03:05.450> style<00:03:05.870> so

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
he's never really had a great style so

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.450 
he's never really had a great style so
that's<00:03:06.350> going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.530> probably<00:03:06.770> be<00:03:07.100> brushed

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
that's going to probably be brushed

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.040 
that's going to probably be brushed
under<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.730> rug<00:03:07.820> thankies<00:03:08.600> pants<00:03:08.960> are

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
under the rug thankies pants are

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.420 
under the rug thankies pants are
probably<00:03:09.320> too<00:03:09.470> tight<00:03:09.710> haven't<00:03:10.070> seen<00:03:10.220> him<00:03:10.340> yet

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
probably too tight haven't seen him yet

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.610 
probably too tight haven't seen him yet
though<00:03:10.700> there's<00:03:11.090> been<00:03:11.180> some<00:03:11.570> crazy<00:03:11.750> outfits

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
though there's been some crazy outfits

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.340 
though there's been some crazy outfits
but<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.310> year<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:13.970> most<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.080> black<00:03:15.320> I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
but this year it was most of the black I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.620 
but this year it was most of the black I
think<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.160> maybe<00:03:16.610> less<00:03:16.880> lot<00:03:17.150> more<00:03:17.420> business

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
think so maybe less lot more business

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.980 
think so maybe less lot more business
today<00:03:20.560> now<00:03:21.560> it's<00:03:22.250> time<00:03:22.580> for<00:03:22.940> our<00:03:22.970> live<00:03:23.330> auction
