so<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.470> our<00:00:13.590> past<00:00:13.830> segments<00:00:14.280> we've<00:00:14.430> looked<00:00:14.700> at

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
so in our past segments we've looked at

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820 
so in our past segments we've looked at
the<00:00:15.000> eight<00:00:15.150> basic<00:00:15.480> chords<00:00:16.110> that<00:00:16.380> will<00:00:16.620> get<00:00:16.740> us

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the eight basic chords that will get us

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
the eight basic chords that will get us
playing<00:00:17.070> songs<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> fastest<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.360> they're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
playing songs the fastest is they're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.530 
playing songs the fastest is they're
used<00:00:19.380> very<00:00:19.680> commonly<00:00:19.950> in<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.790> kinds<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> music

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
used very commonly in all kinds of music

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.910 
used very commonly in all kinds of music
we're<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> look<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> couple

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
we're going to look at a couple

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.010 
we're going to look at a couple
variations<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.820> you'll<00:00:23.970> also<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
variations that you'll also see and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.769 
variations that you'll also see and
these<00:00:25.950> are<00:00:26.070> used<00:00:26.220> quite<00:00:26.400> frequently<00:00:26.779> we've

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
these are used quite frequently we've

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.650 
these are used quite frequently we've
looked<00:00:28.110> at<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> G<00:00:28.590> major<00:00:28.860> chord<00:00:29.270> this<00:00:30.270> is<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
looked at the G major chord this is a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
looked at the G major chord this is a
fingering<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.740> looked<00:00:31.950> at<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
fingering that we had looked at for it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.660 
fingering that we had looked at for it
a<00:00:33.110> very<00:00:34.110> common<00:00:34.410> progression<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.490> from

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
a very common progression is to go from

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.900 
a very common progression is to go from
G<00:00:36.000> major<00:00:36.240> to<00:00:36.990> C<00:00:37.230> major<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:38.190> D<00:00:38.400> major<00:00:38.670> that's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
G major to C major to D major that's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
G major to C major to D major that's
used<00:00:39.150> in<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.510> kinds<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.990> songs<00:00:40.200> as<00:00:40.560> I<00:00:40.590> play<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
used in all kinds of songs as I play it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
used in all kinds of songs as I play it
you'll<00:00:41.100> notice<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> sounds<00:00:41.850> very

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
you'll notice that it sounds very

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:53.509 
you'll notice that it sounds very
familiar

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.770 

but<00:00:54.519> there's<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.760> very<00:00:55.030> common<00:00:55.570> movement

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
but there's a very common movement

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.360 
but there's a very common movement
that's<00:00:56.140> used<00:00:56.379> in<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.739> that's<00:00:57.039> actually

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
that's used in that that's actually

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.639 
that's used in that that's actually
easier<00:00:57.820> than<00:00:57.879> going<00:00:58.149> from<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.510> G<00:00:58.780> major<00:00:59.019> to

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
easier than going from this G major to

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.509 
easier than going from this G major to
this<00:00:59.829> C<00:01:00.070> major

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
this C major

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.720 
this C major
it's<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.120> chord<00:01:01.390> called<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.719> C<00:01:01.989> ad<00:01:02.289> nine<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.129> to

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
it's a chord called a C ad nine and to

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.120 
it's a chord called a C ad nine and to
do<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.059> all<00:01:04.360> we<00:01:04.390> do<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:04.869> take<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.199> G<00:01:05.890> major

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
do that all we do is take the G major

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.310 
do that all we do is take the G major
and<00:01:06.430> then<00:01:07.000> take<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.330> first<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.900> second

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
and then take the first and second

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.289 
and then take the first and second
fingers<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.890> move<00:01:09.159> them<00:01:09.369> one<00:01:09.549> string<00:01:09.940> towards

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
fingers and move them one string towards

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.090 
fingers and move them one string towards
the<00:01:10.450> floor<00:01:10.720> keeping<00:01:11.110> them<00:01:11.229> on<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.470> same<00:01:11.710> frets

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
the floor keeping them on the same frets

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.219 
the floor keeping them on the same frets
so<00:01:12.369> instead<00:01:13.119> of<00:01:13.240> being<00:01:13.390> on<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.479> fifth<00:01:13.840> string

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
so instead of being on the fifth string

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.719 
so instead of being on the fifth string
with<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.680> first<00:01:14.710> finger<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> sixth

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
with the first finger and the sixth

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.550 
with the first finger and the sixth
string<00:01:15.880> with<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.149> second<00:01:16.479> finger<00:01:16.630> will<00:01:17.380> now

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
string with the second finger will now

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.490 
string with the second finger will now
be<00:01:17.770> on<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.640> fourth<00:01:19.360> string<00:01:19.509> second<00:01:20.140> fret<00:01:20.229> with

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
be on the fourth string second fret with

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.100 
be on the fourth string second fret with
the<00:01:20.619> first<00:01:20.860> finger<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.810> fifth<00:01:22.810> string

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the first finger and the fifth string

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.870 
the first finger and the fifth string
third<00:01:23.530> fret<00:01:23.740> with<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.070> second<00:01:24.430> finger<00:01:24.549> you

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
third fret with the second finger you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.820 
third fret with the second finger you
can<00:01:25.000> just<00:01:25.179> pick<00:01:25.390> those<00:01:25.600> up<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.990> move<00:01:26.590> them

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
can just pick those up and move them

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.580 
can just pick those up and move them
together<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:28.210> we'll<00:01:28.869> be<00:01:28.990> strumming<00:01:29.200> five

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
together and we'll be strumming five

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.149 
together and we'll be strumming five
strings<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.360> creates<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:32.050> C<00:01:32.500> ad<00:01:32.800> nine

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
strings and that creates a C ad nine

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.560 
strings and that creates a C ad nine
chord

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.300 

from<00:01:40.570> there<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.170> go<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.289> addy<00:01:41.679> we<00:01:41.979> can<00:01:42.130> just

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
from there to go to addy we can just

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.980 
from there to go to addy we can just
leave<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.609> third<00:01:42.880> finger<00:01:43.270> where<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.689> on

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
leave the third finger where it is on

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.660 
leave the third finger where it is on
the<00:01:44.109> third<00:01:44.409> fret<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.799> second<00:01:45.189> string<00:01:45.219> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
the third fret of the second string and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.760 
the third fret of the second string and
bring<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.570> first<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.109> second<00:01:47.469> fingers

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
bring the first and second fingers

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.149 
bring the first and second fingers
around<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.369> D<00:01:48.549> major<00:01:48.759> fingering<00:01:50.159> another

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
around to that D major fingering another

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.709 
around to that D major fingering another
variation<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.880> D<00:01:52.060> chord<00:01:52.359> that's<00:01:52.450> used

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
variation of the D chord that's used

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.480 
variation of the D chord that's used
however<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.409> just<00:01:53.829> leave<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.219> fourth

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
however is to just leave the fourth

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.880 
however is to just leave the fourth
finger<00:01:54.850> where<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.299> on<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.689> first<00:01:56.530> string

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
finger where it is on the first string

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.850 
finger where it is on the first string
as<00:01:57.069> we<00:01:57.189> go<00:01:57.310> from<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.640> C<00:01:57.909> at<00:01:58.209> 9<00:01:58.600> or<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.990> G<00:01:59.259> major<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
as we go from a C at 9 or a G major to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:10.199 
as we go from a C at 9 or a G major to
that<00:02:00.009> D

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.959 

and<00:02:10.479> then<00:02:11.319> it's<00:02:11.739> very<00:02:12.010> simple<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.609> just<00:02:12.670> go<00:02:12.939> to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
and then it's very simple to just go to

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.940 
and then it's very simple to just go to
the<00:02:13.150> D<00:02:13.329> major<00:02:13.540> by<00:02:13.989> removing<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.560> fourth

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the D major by removing that fourth

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:29.000 
the D major by removing that fourth
finger<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:17.319> then<00:02:17.439> we'll<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.620> this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
