00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and Nikki strong coups but anyway I've

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.040 
and Nikki strong coups but anyway I've
done<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:35.970> before<00:02:36.360> when<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.569> use<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> hand

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
so it's hard to say so like I have to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.530 
so it's hard to say so like I have to
readjust<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.720> where<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.959> cut<00:02:43.260> my<00:02:43.440> plugs<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.540> cut

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.560 
readjust to where I cut my plugs and cut
this<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.700> signal<00:02:48.060> disappeared

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
this one here and the signal disappeared

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.270 
this one here and the signal disappeared
to<00:02:48.720> scan<00:02:48.959> again<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.410> detector<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:49.980> here

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
to scan again with the detector in here

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.150

cleaned<00:03:20.099> up<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.400> later<00:03:21.170> nice<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.410> yard

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
cleaned up a bit later nice little yard

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.040 
cleaned up a bit later nice little yard
here<00:03:23.010> not<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> ton<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.970> signals<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:24.629> definitely

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
here not a ton of signals but definitely

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.080 
here not a ton of signals but definitely
some<00:03:25.170> coins<00:03:25.379> in<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.769> well<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.879> a<00:03:26.910> new

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
some coins in here well this is a new

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.660 
some coins in here well this is a new
one<00:03:27.120> for<00:03:27.330> me<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.750> got<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> solid<00:03:28.590> 1241<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
one for me you got a solid 1241 on the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.100 
one for me you got a solid 1241 on the
surface<00:03:30.090> figured<00:03:30.360> I'd<00:03:30.480> check<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.780> out<00:03:30.870> what<00:03:31.019> it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
surface figured I'd check it out what it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.839 
surface figured I'd check it out what it
is<00:03:31.260> because<00:03:31.500> sometimes<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> old<00:03:32.610> bigger

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
is because sometimes the old bigger

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.640 
is because sometimes the old bigger
tokens<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.510> sound<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:33.900> they're<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.140> top<00:03:34.349> if

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
tokens can sound like they're on top if

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.039 
tokens can sound like they're on top if
the<00:03:34.799> real<00:03:35.010> solid<00:03:35.400> targets<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.510> that's<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
the real solid targets and that's the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:48.000 
the real solid targets and that's the
first<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.500> me<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> duck<00:03:39.420> head<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> rope

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.839 

that's<00:03:48.610> really<00:03:48.849> weird<00:03:49.290> clean<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.319> up<00:03:50.470> later

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
that's really weird clean that up later

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.309 
that's really weird clean that up later
all<00:03:51.849> right<00:03:52.060> I'm<00:03:52.180> almost<00:03:52.420> finished<00:03:52.689> up<00:03:53.049> did

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
all right I'm almost finished up did

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.619 
all right I'm almost finished up did
several<00:03:53.590> patterns<00:03:53.950> over<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.579> yard<00:03:54.790> trying<00:03:55.569> to

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
several patterns over the yard trying to

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.199 
several patterns over the yard trying to
mop<00:03:55.810> up<00:03:55.840> anything<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.530> missed<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.849> signal

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
mop up anything I missed and the signal

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.580 
mop up anything I missed and the signal
sounds<00:03:58.480> better<00:03:58.629> now<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.019> i'm<00:03:59.110> down<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.290> it

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
sounds better now that i'm down to it

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.899 
sounds better now that i'm down to it
I'll<00:04:02.590> do<00:04:02.709> this<00:04:02.829> one<00:04:02.890> live<00:04:03.189> in<00:04:03.370> case<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.879> a

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
I'll do this one live in case this is a

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.390 
I'll do this one live in case this is a
silver<00:04:04.209> coin<00:04:04.590> started<00:04:05.590> out<00:04:05.680> as<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.829> penny<00:04:06.129> tone

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
silver coin started out as a penny tone

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:20.039 
silver coin started out as a penny tone

most of the houses in that Street were
built<00:05:51.219> in<00:05:51.279> the<00:05:51.399> 30s<00:05:51.789> so<00:05:52.779> probably<00:05:53.439> around<00:05:53.620> in

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
built in the 30s so probably around in

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.829 
built in the 30s so probably around in
there<00:05:54.099> but<00:05:54.699> not<00:05:55.029> a<00:05:55.089> lot<00:05:55.149> of<00:05:55.270> trash<00:05:55.569> in<00:05:55.719> the<00:05:55.810> yard

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
there but not a lot of trash in the yard

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.559 
there but not a lot of trash in the yard
so<00:05:56.139> it<00:05:56.199> was<00:05:56.319> pretty<00:05:56.439> easy<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:57.089> hunt<00:05:58.089> you<00:05:58.389> can

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
so it was pretty easy to hunt you can

00:05:58.569 --> 00:05:59.820 
so it was pretty easy to hunt you can
saw<00:05:58.719> that<00:05:58.870> they'd<00:05:59.080> had<00:05:59.349> done<00:05:59.500> some<00:05:59.710> work

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:01.149 
putting in some pipes so I figured it

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:02.670 
putting in some pipes so I figured it
