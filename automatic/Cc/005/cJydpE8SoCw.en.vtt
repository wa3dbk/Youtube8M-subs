00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.460
 hello my name is vitaly if you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.660
 Remember those who watched our videos that in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 tablet review 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.010
 exo kill beer 701 I did not like 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.990
 showed work on it toys and said 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.510
 what is this all show in one of the following 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.630
 videos but finally that moment came 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.219
 all the more turned up the opportunity I 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.030
 Found out that in the play market 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.610
 asphalt 8 became free earlier for him 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 asked for some money and now it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.770
 you can download for free 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.690
 the only thing that weighs a lot of course 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.390
 as well as all the toys that is there and a half 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.289
 gigabyte of course swinging by wifi 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.239
 well let's start the solo race 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:06.330
 nevada further we will not paint anything 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.180
 we start the race 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.159
 the toy is pretty nicely done that is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.580
 with high quality graphics but also see 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.860
 how to digest this tablet will remind 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.530
 iron tablet here we have 4 nuclear 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.100
 the processor is at 1 gigahertz and runs on 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 frequency 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.720
 Next we have gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.720
 and dual-core video under the system 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.799
 control is made with oblique 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.700
 tablets so excuse me some 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.420
 gruffness simultaneously manage and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.180
 follow the race 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.820
 tells something and watch yet how 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:55.440
 this is all taken a little awkward in 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.369
 basically the wind is pretty decent 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.479
 pretty smoothly everything moves 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.140
 the only thing that in my opinion 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.149
 there are such slowdowns 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.970
 mogod image moves under the spirit 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.970
 jerking you turn on the acceleration 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.340
 well i think you see what to play 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.219
 In general, it is quite possible to have everything 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.379
 it works that is no complaints except 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.689
 like the fact that I already said that it seems like 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.700
 noticeable at some moments some 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.219
 twitching image but than this 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.109
 connected you will need to check this toy 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:41.680
 but some in the next tablet 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:45.060
 may be more powerful iron on this 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.060
 i'm out of this game 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.049
 leave the race we will leave 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.830
 and the next toy you have it too 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.950
 seen in one of my reviews on 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.070
 the wheel main tablet here 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.050
 three-dimensional 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:21.730
 poison said jump in principle graphics too 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.340
 very high quality and in this game and 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.190
 so it will also be interesting to see how 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.320
 does the tablet handle it though honestly 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.370
 speaking at this screen resolution 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.420
 which is here 1024 by 768 I think that 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.920
 2 nuclear graphics system 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.520
 GPU would 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.840
 or processor core i would say that 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.390
 for sure he will cope very 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.270
 Well I do not think that it is difficult and 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.110
 a whole gigabyte of RAM that is all 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.230
 Wonderful plus still fresh 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.860
 android 4 2 2 system in this processor 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.380
 android 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.020
 but you see toys so big 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.270
 they sink the roofs this pretty 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.270
 long digest as you can see it all 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.709
 spinning spinning loads well in 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.780
 As a result, I think everything will be fine. 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.600
 all the more and look at the layout 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.690
 single player game 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.130
 mean one passed me here went 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.930
 second level chapter 2 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.750
 very beautiful screen saver very beautiful 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 video saver it is a pity that this is all 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.800
 you have to waste because not 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.570
 I want to spend on it all this time already 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:46.380
 I have earned extra 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:51.260
 weapon is a place where you can save 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:05:02.320
 so for a gun just there shooting me 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:05:02.320
 I shoot a prisoner 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.190
 may ready yet 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.780
 all drank a hole to aim 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:40.970
 forces have water the brother must now destroy 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:46.040
 change the bow of the earth fire or all 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:57.570
 Of these honestly, I left the wipe 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:06:00.500
 carried away went beyond the edges of the screen so he still 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.500
 somewhere left 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.010
 what is it like it moves from pay 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.660
 attention limping this main character 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:20.650
 but basically the toy is interesting so 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.650
 we have to do this here to us 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:34.940
 covered with crystal beat while crystal 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.630
 don't match the light here we go on 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.630
 throne 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:49.340
 here it coincided 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:51.410
 go ahead free the captive but also 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.570
 so here it works the players i think 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.540
 that you are convinced that everything works very 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.280
 even wonderful on this tablet and on 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.850
 this is probably my today's video review 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:06.460
 finished here what i achieved in this game 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:08.900
