00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
already know the Lowell reefa this is

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.610 
already know the Lowell reefa this is
the<00:00:45.730> way<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.000> reefa<00:00:46.300> has<00:00:46.450> always<00:00:46.750> come<00:00:46.990> but

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
the way the reefa has always come but

here's a side view transparent model of
the<00:01:24.799> reefa<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.189> show<00:01:25.490> three<00:01:26.330> daylight

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
the reefa to show three daylight

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.359 
the reefa to show three daylight
fluorescent<00:01:26.929> lamps<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.799> action<00:01:28.280> these<00:01:28.939> use

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
fluorescent lamps in action these use

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.340 
fluorescent lamps in action these use
5500<00:01:31.369> k<00:01:31.640> daylight<00:01:32.299> fluorescent<00:01:32.479> lamps<00:01:33.170> they

5500 k daylight fluorescent lamps they

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.899 
5500 k daylight fluorescent lamps they
are<00:01:33.500> high<00:01:33.740> frequency<00:01:34.310> lamps<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:34.759> they're

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
are high frequency lamps so they're

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.630 
are high frequency lamps so they're
flicker<00:01:35.210> free<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:35.780> they<00:01:36.649> also<00:01:36.890> have<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.399> very
