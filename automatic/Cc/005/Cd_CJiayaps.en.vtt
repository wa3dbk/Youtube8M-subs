00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
starts and ends these notes all those

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.860 
starts and ends these notes all those
different<00:01:30.490> things<00:01:30.520> giving<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.210> real<00:01:31.390> 80s

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
different things giving that real 80s

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.650 
different things giving that real 80s
sax<00:01:32.200> sound<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.880> important<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.330> try<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.570> do

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
sax sound it's important to try and do

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.700 
sax sound it's important to try and do
them<00:01:34.780> when<00:01:34.930> you're<00:01:35.050> playing<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.380> yourself

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
them when you're playing it yourself

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.400 
them when you're playing it yourself
so<00:01:36.610> let's<00:01:36.760> look<00:01:36.850> at<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.030> notes<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:38.229> quite

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
so let's look at the notes it's quite

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.500 
so let's look at the notes it's quite
repetitive<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.430> very<00:01:39.610> first<00:01:39.910> bit<00:01:40.119> starts

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
repetitive but the very first bit starts

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.920 
repetitive but the very first bit starts
like<00:01:40.660> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.810 

so<00:01:46.930> those<00:01:47.140> notes<00:01:47.410> starts<00:01:47.890> way<00:01:48.040> down<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.280> low<00:01:48.550> E

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
so those notes starts way down a low E

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.760 
so those notes starts way down a low E
remember<00:01:49.780> got<00:01:49.930> F<00:01:50.110> sharps<00:01:50.470> all<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.680> way

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
remember got F sharps all the way

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.600 
remember got F sharps all the way
through<00:01:50.979> here<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.460> e<00:01:51.610> F<00:01:52.540> sharp
