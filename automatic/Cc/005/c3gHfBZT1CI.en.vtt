00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.660 
other do the same thing teachers are not
competitive<00:01:57.260> by<00:01:57.680> nature<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.100> don't<00:01:58.280> think<00:01:58.520> they

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
competitive by nature I don't think they

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.370 
competitive by nature I don't think they
want<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.030> share<00:01:59.360> they<00:01:59.720> want<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.200> cooperate

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
want to share they want to cooperate

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.440 
want to share they want to cooperate
because<00:02:00.950> we're<00:02:01.370> all<00:02:01.520> have<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.940> same<00:02:02.120> goal

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
because we're all have the same goal

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.300 
because we're all have the same goal
we're<00:02:03.080> not<00:02:03.229> pitted<00:02:03.590> against<00:02:03.920> each<00:02:04.040> other

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
we're not pitted against each other

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.000 
we're not pitted against each other
there's<00:02:04.610> not<00:02:04.790> just<00:02:04.820> one<00:02:05.590> school<00:02:06.590> district

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
there's not just one school district

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.320 
there's not just one school district
that's<00:02:07.159> succeeding<00:02:07.670> hopefully<00:02:08.000> they<00:02:08.149> all

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
that's succeeding hopefully they all

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.419 
that's succeeding hopefully they all
will<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.049> we're<00:02:09.890> building<00:02:10.220> up<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
will and so we're building up the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.699 
will and so we're building up the
infrastructure<00:02:10.540> for<00:02:11.540> teachers<00:02:12.319> kind<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.560> have

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
infrastructure for teachers kind of have

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.110 
infrastructure for teachers kind of have
a<00:02:12.740> little<00:02:12.980> bit<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.250> common<00:02:13.670> language<00:02:14.090> common

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
a little bit of common language common

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.820 
a little bit of common language common
experience<00:02:15.110> if<00:02:15.260> they've<00:02:15.380> gone<00:02:15.530> through<00:02:15.590> our

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
experience if they've gone through our

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.920 
experience if they've gone through our
program<00:02:16.190> together<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.760> they<00:02:17.480> can

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
program together and they can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.959 
program together and they can
just<00:02:18.170> continue<00:02:19.099> their<00:02:19.310> learning<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.849> an

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
just continue their learning on an

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.970 
just continue their learning on an
individual<00:02:20.480> basis<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.109> use<00:02:21.260> each<00:02:21.439> other<00:02:21.680> as<00:02:21.769> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
individual basis and use each other as a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.060 
individual basis and use each other as a
resource<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.609> do<00:02:22.849> that
