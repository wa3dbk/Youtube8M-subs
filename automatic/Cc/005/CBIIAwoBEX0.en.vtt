standards were sent pretty high with the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.860 
standards were sent pretty high with the
last<00:00:50.680> couple<00:00:50.920> times<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.550> had<00:00:51.760> we<00:00:52.510> knew<00:00:52.660> we<00:00:52.780> had

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
last couple times I had we knew we had

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.620 
last couple times I had we knew we had
to<00:00:52.900> exceed<00:00:53.410> that<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.640> set<00:00:55.300> out<00:00:55.450> some

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
to exceed that so we set out some

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.110 
to exceed that so we set out some
parameters<00:00:56.170> of<00:00:56.350> what<00:00:56.380> I<00:00:56.530> wanted<00:00:56.980> but<00:00:57.370> it<00:00:57.910> was

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
parameters of what I wanted but it was

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.730 
parameters of what I wanted but it was
good<00:00:58.660> though<00:00:58.690> because<00:00:58.930> they<00:00:59.290> would<00:00:59.440> be<00:00:59.590> very

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
good though because they would be very

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.120 
good though because they would be very
specific<00:01:00.360> now<00:01:01.360> because<00:01:01.810> I<00:01:02.140> knew<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.650> worked<00:01:02.890> so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
specific now because I knew it worked so

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.570 
specific now because I knew it worked so

that's given us a peek of the potential
there<00:05:05.719> I<00:05:06.719> was<00:05:06.840> able<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.199> do<00:05:07.319> that<00:05:07.439> twice<00:05:07.830> more

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
there I was able to do that twice more

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.100 
there I was able to do that twice more
in<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.520> race

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
in the race

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.640 
in the race
so<00:05:09.710> I'm<00:05:09.890> actually<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.310> lot<00:05:10.430> further<00:05:10.730> along

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
so I'm actually a lot further along

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.020 
so I'm actually a lot further along
where<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:12.680> thought<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:13.010> would<00:05:13.280> be<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.520> year

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
where I thought I would be the year

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.140 
where I thought I would be the year
racing<00:05:14.300> WRC<00:05:15.290> I<00:05:15.770> didn't<00:05:16.220> expect<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.580> be<00:05:16.850> able<00:05:16.940> to

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
racing WRC I didn't expect to be able to

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.660 
racing WRC I didn't expect to be able to
do<00:05:17.240> that<00:05:17.390> so<00:05:17.630> much<00:05:17.810> more<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.380> years<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:18.950> you

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
do that so much more to the years so you

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.220 
do that so much more to the years so you
know<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:19.940> event<00:05:20.210> was<00:05:20.300> kind<00:05:20.540> of<00:05:20.600> crap<00:05:20.840> for<00:05:21.080> me

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
know the event was kind of crap for me

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.350 
know the event was kind of crap for me
because<00:05:21.620> what<00:05:22.610> happened<00:05:22.940> on<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.060> stage

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
because what happened on the stage

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.720 
because what happened on the stage
blocks<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:24.410> result<00:05:24.770> wasn't<00:05:24.950> very<00:05:25.220> good<00:05:25.310> but

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
blocks the result wasn't very good but

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.080 
blocks the result wasn't very good but
he<00:05:26.660> never<00:05:26.870> identified<00:05:27.200> but<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:27.860> did<00:05:28.040> Alicia

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
he never identified but I did Alicia
