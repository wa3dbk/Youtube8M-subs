00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
was a you can teleport on your snapshots

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.689 
was a you can teleport on your snapshots
and<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.620> snapshot<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.520> can

teleporting<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.780> well<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.440> teleporting<00:00:59.010> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
teleporting as well as teleporting so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.590

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like and tell them 90 degrees so with

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.750 
like and tell them 90 degrees so with
the<00:01:04.229> teleport<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.830> whoop<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.489> turn

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the teleport it like whoop the turn

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.429 
the teleport it like whoop the turn
light<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:05.970> user<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> which<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> really

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
light into user that and which is really

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
light into user that and which is really
cool<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
cool and so they got that and you can

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
cool and so they got that and you can
also<00:01:10.170> add<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.189> well<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> fill

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
also add if well there is a fill

also add if well there is a fill
commands<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.200> still<00:01:14.150> something<00:01:15.150> but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
commands you like do still something but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
commands you like do still something but
you<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> add<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.810> coordinates<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you have to add like coordinates so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.539 
you have to add like coordinates so
don't<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> can

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
don't we know how to do that but you can

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.630 
don't we know how to do that but you can
do<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.040> also<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
do that and and there it's also the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.609 
do that and and there it's also the
clone<00:01:20.880> effect<00:01:21.180> which<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.360> pretty<00:01:21.780> damn<00:01:22.259> cool

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
clone effect which is pretty damn cool

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
clone effect which is pretty damn cool
and<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.270> made<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.869> house

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and so I have made like a little house

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.760 
and so I have made like a little house
here<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.490> nice<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.229> I'm<00:01:28.229> probably

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
here it's pretty nice and I'm probably

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.649 
here it's pretty nice and I'm probably
tortured<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.729> pretty<00:01:29.820> dark<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
tortured in it so it's pretty dark so

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210 
tortured in it so it's pretty dark so
the<00:01:31.110> first<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.619> we're<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the first thing we're going to do it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.440 
the first thing we're going to do it
we're<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> type<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.880> clone<00:01:33.240> like

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we're just going to type in clone like

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.780 
we're just going to type in clone like
that<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.829> says<00:01:34.979> x1<00:01:35.430> y1

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that and as you can see it says x1 y1

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.859 
that and as you can see it says x1 y1
that<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.950> x1<00:01:38.310> y1<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.390> bottom<00:01:39.810> one

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that one now the x1 y1 is the bottom one

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
that one now the x1 y1 is the bottom one
here<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> bottom<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.210> first

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
here is the bottom bit here and first

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
here is the bottom bit here and first
off<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.259> let<00:01:46.920> me<00:01:46.950> get<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
off when I do the first let me get this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.200 
off when I do the first let me get this
and<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:48.770> I<00:01:49.770> took<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.549> coordinates<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:50.970> here

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and I I took the coordinates from here

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.889 
and I I took the coordinates from here
and<00:01:51.590> copied<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.100> floor<00:01:53.570> well<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.750> think

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and copied like this floor well I think

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.499 
and copied like this floor well I think
this<00:01:55.320> floor<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.770> copied<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:57.180> messed

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
this floor here I copied and it messed

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.020 
this floor here I copied and it messed
out<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> floor<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.030> make

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
out the floor so now you want to make

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
out the floor so now you want to make
sure<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.079> below<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
sure you are like one below it so you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.389 
sure you are like one below it so you
are<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.399> copying<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.880> floor<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.399> yes

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
are like copying the floor there and yes

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
are like copying the floor there and yes
so<00:02:05.549> that's<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.780> x1<00:02:07.140> y1<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> dead

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so that's that one the x1 y1 and dead

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.130 
so that's that one the x1 y1 and dead
one

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
one

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.040 
one
the<00:02:09.590> X<00:02:09.770> 2<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.729> y<00:02:10.880> 2<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.480> dead<00:02:11.630> 2<00:02:11.840> is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the X 2 and the y 2 and the dead 2 is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.480 
the X 2 and the y 2 and the dead 2 is
the<00:02:12.320> one<00:02:12.470> up<00:02:12.620> here<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.040> make<00:02:13.130> sure<00:02:13.340> you're

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the one up here to make sure you're

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.460 
the one up here to make sure you're
standing<00:02:13.670> away<00:02:14.510> from<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.990> building<00:02:15.290> there

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
standing away from the building there

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.660 
standing away from the building there
and<00:02:15.680> away<00:02:15.890> from<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.130> bill<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.340> there<00:02:16.490> and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and away from the bill in there and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.620 
and away from the bill in there and
above<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> building<00:02:17.780> like<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:20.240> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
above the building like that and so the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.880 
above the building like that and so the
first<00:02:20.810> thing<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.110> want<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.290> do<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.650> actually

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
first thing you want to do is actually

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.680 
first thing you want to do is actually
write<00:02:22.250> down<00:02:22.310> what<00:02:22.910> these<00:02:23.120> coordinates<00:02:23.570> are

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
write down what these coordinates are

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.450 
write down what these coordinates are
because<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.140> won't<00:02:24.290> know<00:02:25.100> what<00:02:25.310> they

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
because you won't know what they

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.370 
because you won't know what they
actually<00:02:25.610> are<00:02:25.790> when<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.300> typing<00:02:26.540> so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
actually are when you are typing so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.040 
actually are when you are typing so
we're<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.950> first<00:02:27.980> X<00:02:28.520> ones<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.360> they're<00:02:29.510> y1

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
we're the first X ones and they're y1

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.810 
we're the first X ones and they're y1
and<00:02:30.290> you'll<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.130> one<00:02:31.280> me<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.460> a<00:02:31.520> minute<00:02:31.730> so

and you'll get one me in a minute so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.250 
and you'll get one me in a minute so
let's<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.150> type<00:02:32.300> in<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.660> one<00:02:32.810> first<00:02:32.990> it's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
let's just type in this one first it's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.440 
let's just type in this one first it's
56<00:02:33.650> 70<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:35.260> 176<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:37.130> oh<00:02:37.400> no<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.060> don't<00:02:38.240> me<00:02:38.330> do

that I did a slash there we go so that
is<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.810> y<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.130> they're<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.520> 1<00:02:44.240> or<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> X<00:02:44.720> 1y

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
is the y so they're my 1 or the X 1y

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.570 
is the y so they're my 1 or the X 1y
those<00:02:46.160> X<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.850> Y<00:02:47.000> 2<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.540> zetsu<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.580> so

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
those X to the Y 2 and zetsu and so

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.090 
those X to the Y 2 and zetsu and so
we've<00:02:49.850> got<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.450> now<00:02:50.510> we<00:02:50.720> want<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.380> find

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
so lets you type in slash clone like

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.070 
so lets you type in slash clone like
this<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.380> says<00:03:18.500> x1<00:03:19.010> y1<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.180> said<00:03:20.750> once<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
this and it says x1 y1 and said once so

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.610 
this and it says x1 y1 and said once so
let's<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.350> slash<00:03:21.560> clone<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:23.269> X<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.720> 42<00:03:24.410> as

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
let's do slash clone and the X is 42 as

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.350 
let's do slash clone and the X is 42 as
you<00:03:24.739> can<00:03:24.860> see<00:03:25.070> in<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.549> top<00:03:25.760> left<00:03:26.170> 63<00:03:27.170> +<00:03:28.040> 1<00:03:28.549> 6<00:03:29.090> 8

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
you can see in the top left 63 + 1 6 8

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.810 
you can see in the top left 63 + 1 6 8
now<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.900> want<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.170> get<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.500> X<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.190> Y<00:03:31.340> 2<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
now you want to get the X to the Y 2 and

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.360 
now you want to get the X to the Y 2 and
the<00:03:32.540> Zed<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.170> did<00:03:33.709> type<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.040> before<00:03:34.340> that

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
coordinates where I want to clone it

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.860 
coordinates where I want to clone it
that<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.430> X<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.000> y<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.510> Zetas<00:03:47.750> I

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
that is the X and the y on the Zetas I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.440 
that is the X and the y on the Zetas I
just<00:03:48.080> happened<00:03:48.320> before<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.830> said<00:03:49.010> before

mean where you need to kind of like
remember<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.390> coordinates<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.530> it's

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
remember the coordinates and so it's

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.840 
remember the coordinates and so it's
best<00:03:57.830> just<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.070> type<00:03:58.250> them<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.489> chat<00:03:58.549> and
