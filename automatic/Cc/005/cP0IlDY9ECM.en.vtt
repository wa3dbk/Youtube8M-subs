00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.450
 Hello and welcome, I am going to do 4 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.630
 and today I bring you the continuation of 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.020
 match that climbed yesterday from fifa more 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.340
 specifically the cifa 13 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.290
 the sub apart because I found 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 several details 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 without much importance but good are 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.670
 details that I wanted to comment and that's why 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.870
 I upload the video 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.129
 part of the party 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.120
 and well I'm going to start the first thing 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.650
 I want to say that this year the penalties 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.650
 they are more real 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.140
 for a number of reasons that good 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.079
 I will start 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.800
 to count now and the first of the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.180
 reasons is that the players failing 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.950
 the penalty 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.960
 they get angry with themselves 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 and they can even hit a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 punch to the ground 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.860
 in this game it will look like when 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.860
 pique falla hits a punch to the ground 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.689
 and just like when you mark it, they arrive 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.689
 they can get to celebrate with rage with 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.689
 euphoria 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.440
 so this is a hoot 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.600
 the second interesting point to find 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.590
 is that the goalkeepers when they fit a 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.039
 goal on penalties 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.579
 you can get to be thoughtful in 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.579
 the ground as if they were real players 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.429
 frank with themselves and also when 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.429
 they stop too they celebrate it 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.019
 we can also see as point 3 also 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.069
 we can see small for girls of 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.069
 some of the players 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.629
 and even the fans whistled at their 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.459
 own hobby when failing a pine forest 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.769
 whistle before his own hobby when failing 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.769
 a penalty and even 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.079
 they will even put pressure whistling 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.079
 opposing team or visitor 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.730
 penalties will also be frequent 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.100
 what panenka 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:57.360
 and we lock them up as you want to call them 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.190
 and well this was the details I wanted 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.480
 bring 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.480
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.830
 nothing great but they are good 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.780

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.780
