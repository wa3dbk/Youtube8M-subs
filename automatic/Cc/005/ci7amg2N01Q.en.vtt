things<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.609> my<00:03:42.090> hair<00:03:42.329> wasn't<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.900> big<00:03:43.079> fan<00:03:43.109> of

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
things that my hair wasn't a big fan of

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.379 
things that my hair wasn't a big fan of
then<00:03:43.650> my<00:03:43.829> hair<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.280> more<00:03:44.489> responsive<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.120> now

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
then my hair is more responsive to now

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.569 
then my hair is more responsive to now
so<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.989> wanted<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.620> check<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.130> out<00:03:47.280> and

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
so I wanted to just check it out and

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.420 
so I wanted to just check it out and
that<00:03:48.389> might<00:03:48.510> explain<00:03:48.810> why<00:03:48.900> because<00:03:49.709> even<00:03:50.310> in

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
that might explain why because even in

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.979 
that might explain why because even in
small<00:03:50.579> amounts<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.299> guess<00:03:51.450> my<00:03:51.630> hair<00:03:51.810> does<00:03:51.959> not

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
small amounts I guess my hair does not

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.839 
small amounts I guess my hair does not
like<00:03:52.380> orange<00:03:52.829> extract<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.700> might

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
like orange extract so that might

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.520 
like orange extract so that might
explain<00:03:54.150> why<00:03:54.239> don't<00:03:54.569> like<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:55.290> weird

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
explain why don't like this so weird

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
explain why don't like this so weird
because<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:56.549> was<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.849> insane<00:03:57.239> for<00:03:57.480> me<00:03:57.540> not<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
because it was like insane for me not to
