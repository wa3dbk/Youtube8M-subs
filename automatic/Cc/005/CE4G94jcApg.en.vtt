00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.550 
drill one up here because right here is
where<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:21.980> notch<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.810> flange<00:02:24.140> fits

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
where the notch is so this flange fits

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.250 
where the notch is so this flange fits
up<00:02:24.739> in<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.190> straddles<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:26.599> straddles

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
up in there it straddles it straddles

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.180 
up in there it straddles it straddles
that<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:29.209> would<00:02:30.019> say<00:02:30.260> probably<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.069> were

but the hitch fits beautifully up in
there<00:03:16.880> it's<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.329> nice<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.930> contoured<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.880> it

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
there it's it's nice and contoured so it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.530 
there it's it's nice and contoured so it
follows<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.600> flow<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.200> van<00:03:22.060> fits<00:03:23.060> right<00:03:23.269> up<00:03:23.420> in

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
follows the flow of van fits right up in

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.920 
follows the flow of van fits right up in
here<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.930> even<00:03:25.090> put<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.180> spoiler<00:03:26.480> back<00:03:26.720> in

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
here and I even put the spoiler back in

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.970 
here and I even put the spoiler back in
there<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.139> have<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.380> take<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:29.920> put<00:03:30.920> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
there you have to take this put the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.590 
there you have to take this put the
spoiler<00:03:31.250> back<00:03:31.459> up<00:03:31.639> in<00:03:31.790> there<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.269> notched

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
spoiler back up in there and I notched

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.620 
spoiler back up in there and I notched
it<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:34.310> really<00:03:34.880> ended<00:03:35.090> up<00:03:35.209> with<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.389> nice

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
it out and I really ended up with a nice

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.250 
it out and I really ended up with a nice
clean<00:03:37.780> install<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:40.730> far<00:03:41.000> looks<00:03:41.870> like<00:03:41.959> it's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
clean install and so far looks like it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:52.979 
clean install and so far looks like it's
gonna<00:03:42.410> work<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:43.340> fine<00:03:43.549> for<00:03:43.609> us<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.150> now<00:03:44.180> I

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.420 

carry<00:03:53.989> my<00:03:54.139> bicycles<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.829> back<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.370> I'm

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
carry my bicycles on the back and I'm

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.550 
carry my bicycles on the back and I'm
good<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:55.670> go<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.750> will<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.139> to<00:04:00.290> drill

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
good to go so you will have to drill

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.979 
good to go so you will have to drill
let's<00:04:00.920> see<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.069> think<00:04:01.239> these<00:04:02.239> top<00:04:02.510> two<00:04:02.720> holes

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
let's see I think these top two holes

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.420 
let's see I think these top two holes
they're<00:04:03.290> already<00:04:03.620> drilled<00:04:03.859> this<00:04:04.069> hole<00:04:04.130> was

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
they're already drilled this hole was

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.890 
they're already drilled this hole was
drilled<00:04:04.579> as<00:04:04.849> well<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.970> is<00:04:08.120> one<00:04:08.299> factory<00:04:08.690> ones

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
drilled as well this is one factory ones

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.720 
drilled as well this is one factory ones
I<00:04:09.200> had<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.530> come<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:09.799> just<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:10.160> little<00:04:10.190> bit<00:04:10.430> this

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
I had to come up just a little bit this

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.759 
I had to come up just a little bit this
was<00:04:10.940> right<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.450> right<00:04:11.720> on<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.230> bottom<00:04:12.650> of

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
was right on the right on the bottom of

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.309 
was right on the right on the bottom of
the<00:04:12.829> frame<00:04:13.069> so<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.819> came<00:04:14.329> up<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.750> little<00:04:14.900> bit<00:04:15.079> here

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
the frame so I came up a little bit here

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.949 
the frame so I came up a little bit here
on<00:04:15.349> these<00:04:15.620> I<00:04:15.889> drill<00:04:16.250> drill<00:04:17.120> pilots<00:04:17.599> and<00:04:17.840> then

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
on these I drill drill pilots and then

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.860 
on these I drill drill pilots and then
go<00:04:18.140> back<00:04:18.380> in<00:04:18.620> with<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.859> 3/8<00:04:19.280> drill<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.909> had<00:04:20.599> to<00:04:20.720> get

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
go back in with a 3/8 drill I had to get

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.090 
go back in with a 3/8 drill I had to get
a

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
a

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.920 
a
a<00:04:22.430> little<00:04:23.120> bit<00:04:23.240> longer<00:04:23.480> than<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> standard

a little bit longer than a standard
drill<00:04:24.620> bit<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.640> took<00:04:25.760> reach<00:04:26.030> all<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.330> way

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
drill bit so I took reach all the way

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.470 
drill bit so I took reach all the way
through<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:27.380> frame<00:04:27.910> but<00:04:28.910> not<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.180> big<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.420> a
