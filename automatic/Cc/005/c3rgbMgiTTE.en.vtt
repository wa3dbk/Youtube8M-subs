 man knows about closures since 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.680
 several decades 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.710
 carlos cacho vale transformed his passion 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.949
 by mechanics in their way of life and 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.050
 to serve in a community that of federal 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.859
 in the north of between rivers 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.539
 my story about this addiction to 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.720
 the irons and we can tell you at last 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.759
 was born almost that was that I told them it was 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.190
 very young or I finished school 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.600
 primary a father asked me what was going 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.720
 to do and I told him that my sister yes 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.579
 could to a school with the technique 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.010
 industrial is like that because in all 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.199
 eras you want to study a son 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.579
 very expensive and more to me that I had to 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.469
 sending another side did not have cold concord 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.320
 that I was lucky to receive a measured 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.000
 The expert mechanic turner certified 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.790
 which is granted in this opportunity 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.170
 when I received him he told me he offered 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.269
 to put a turnery workshop and with the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.870
 help from him and the will to work 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.310
 slept and some who participated in 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.280
 power to draw up like some credit 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.040
 banking something that with a tradition with 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 that original contribution plus a strong 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 vocation chunk worth built brick 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.340
 on brick the premises and manufactured with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.260
 his own hands many of the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.470
 tools with which the workshop 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.440
 started to work here they have come together 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.229
 two things in true one in the whim 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.420
 mine to be able to progress and get to something 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.080
 have because at that time it was very 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.180
 difficult to buy a machine 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.830
 and there are many that I did in that 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.020
 moment like a press some 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.330
 hand-held machines that were the ones 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.520
 they had the first principles with the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.250
 help from some bank loans and 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.310
 also expanding lately that I 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.260
 I call I do not know if it is well taken in the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.490
 Soya growth we've had 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.580
 is to these buttonholes I decided not to this 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.360
 gave me the opportunity to expand and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.220
 they took me to take more knowledge 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.010
 all that is part of engine and 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.720
 part of agricultural to be able to answer 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.269
 to the work that began to come in 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 restoration of engines that is what 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.750
 he arrived at this moment of having a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.230
 quite complete equipment and very 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.730
 modern 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.950
 the federal workshop has specialized 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.709
 together with the technification acquired in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.239
 Services are geared towards care 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.069
 of tractor and thresher engines 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.870
 our main is the repair 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.360
 rectification of engines that we say 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.860
 but if they are badly taken, I say with 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.310
 all the respect is of my point of 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.620
 view is restoring engines of all 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.079
 what is the engine part of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.120
 internal combustion so much that they use 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.120
 fuel in steel as naphtha as 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.310
 give us we repair here to part 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.650
 we were increasing by die to the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.540
 need what is and that because in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.609
 nor would there be anyone who makes diesel 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.400
 I'm lucky to have the only one 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:13.400
 studied for repair of pumps 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.129
 directors another who does the whole part 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.440
 hydraulic or that to attend 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.340
 needs of the field we are quite 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.050
 complete 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.959
 in the tools part and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.849
 knowledge and fixed engines that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.920
 they use many in the rice fields as 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.420
 Headquarters for irrigation the face of the area 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.420
 they have to do it with wells 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.720
 deep 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.040
 engines that are oxidizing between the 200 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.230
 250 hp us up to 300 horses is the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.280
 tool that we have we are in 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.700
 conditions of being able to restore 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.880
 the mechanic chub is worth a hobby 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.120
 that unlike many people do not 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.020
 allows you to get away from the workshop to restore 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.380
 old cars that I have everything all 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.390
 person has a hobby or a place of one 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.130
 way to get distracted or at least spend 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.920
 the weekend in the free hours a 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.920
 little distended today is plugged 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.740
 maybe what I'm going to say is what 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.200
 same because I like so much to repair 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.630
 an engine or how is restoring a car 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.519
 old this is the way I give me a 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.170
 time when from my problems the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.230
 workshop when I get to work in 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.540
 she 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.580
 it's pretty ridiculous I do not know to another 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.990
 person likes fishing likes to go 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.150
 to do another kind of soccer 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.920
 although I do not rule out any of 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.290
 these sports but my sport is 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.320
 restore my auto risk and I had the 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.000
 luck continues to restore several 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.780
 units which served me 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.060
 even in my years of work 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.550
 received as a savings to go 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.410
 selling what you buy is some 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.910
 tool or changing unit 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.910
 included for our mobility 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.450
 property is detailed soy effect 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.780
 follows and as to the majority he third-party 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.300
 think that the benefits are many and 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.080
 that allow the rural sector to improve 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 and overturn those fruits but I speak for the 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.220
 federal zone now others for not 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.350
 I know a lot but from the area since 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:24.990
 we have had the insertion of 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.990
 to have the soy effect that is called 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.450
 has given the possibility of having a lot 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.190
 work or that more engines are broken 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.210
 because you know puts more into operation 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.640
 agricultural engines and even the part 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.590
 the part of agricultural implement also 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.150
 given the turnery some jobs 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.100
 We also perform as for the customer 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.870
 do not have to go to other cities 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.409
 distant 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.679
 to complement your work 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:56.629
 work is very much the center 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:56.629
 specialized covers a broad
