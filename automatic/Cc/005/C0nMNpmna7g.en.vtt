now I'm ready to add water to the tank

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.799 
now I'm ready to add water to the tank
so<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.730> video<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.090> gonna<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.420> about

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
so this video is gonna be about

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.279 
so this video is gonna be about
ro/di<00:00:13.619> systems<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.430> how<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:14.789> them<00:00:15.289> this

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
ro/di systems and how to use them this

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.820 
ro/di systems and how to use them this
particular<00:00:16.860> model<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.750> Spector<00:00:18.750> pure<00:00:19.140> max

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
particular model is the Spector pure max

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.580 
particular model is the Spector pure max
cap<00:00:20.130> 90<00:00:20.550> gallon<00:00:20.820> per<00:00:20.970> day<00:00:21.290> so<00:00:22.290> that's<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
cap 90 gallon per day so that's the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
cap 90 gallon per day so that's the
installation<00:00:23.430> step<00:00:23.700> so<00:00:23.820> I'm<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.030> to<00:00:24.060> follow

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
installation step so I'm going to follow

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.940 
installation step so I'm going to follow
but<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.870> sure<00:00:25.200> they're<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.470> pretty<00:00:25.620> similar

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
but I'm sure they're all pretty similar

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.620 
but I'm sure they're all pretty similar
so<00:00:26.190> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.370> probably<00:00:26.580> learn<00:00:26.760> something<00:00:27.210> even

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
so you can probably learn something even

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.160 
so you can probably learn something even
if<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.870> don't<00:00:28.020> have<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.320> model<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
if you don't have this model so the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.540 
if you don't have this model so the
first<00:00:31.380> thing<00:00:31.530> we're<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.099> rinse

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
first thing we're going to do is rinse

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.050 
first thing we're going to do is rinse
up<00:00:32.820> over<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> whole<00:00:33.719> system<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> first

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
up over the whole system and the first

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.040 
up over the whole system and the first
step<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.720> remove<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.290> max<00:00:38.130> cap<00:00:38.840> filter<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
step is to remove the max cap filter and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.180 
step is to remove the max cap filter and
the<00:00:41.010> silica<00:00:41.910> Buster<00:00:42.300> filter<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> then

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the silica Buster filter and then

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.850 
the silica Buster filter and then
reinstall<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.060> empty<00:00:45.540> cartridges<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.770> I'm

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
reinstall the empty cartridges and I'm

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.620 
reinstall the empty cartridges and I'm
gonna<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.550> by<00:00:47.640> using<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
gonna do that just by using this that

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.299 
gonna do that just by using this that
came<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.320> it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
there turn it on and let it run for two

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.190 
there turn it on and let it run for two
to<00:02:32.069> five<00:02:32.250> minutes<00:02:32.390> then<00:02:33.390> turn<00:02:33.569> on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.750> tes

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to five minutes then turn on the tes

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.300 
to five minutes then turn on the tes
meters<00:02:42.739> alright<00:02:43.739> now<00:02:43.860> you're<00:02:43.980> supposed<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
meters alright now you're supposed to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.720 
meters alright now you're supposed to
let<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.580> run<00:02:44.850> until<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.160> out<00:02:47.160> meter<00:02:47.989> says<00:02:49.730> zero

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
let it run until the out meter says zero

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.080 
let it run until the out meter says zero
and<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.450> mines<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.190> three<00:02:53.190> right<00:02:53.400> now<00:02:55.940> okay<00:02:56.940> my

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and it mines it three right now okay my

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.430 
and it mines it three right now okay my
tds<00:02:57.480> meter<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.650> reading<00:02:59.040> zero<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.000> i'm<00:03:03.120> gonna

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
tds meter is reading zero so i'm gonna

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.990 
tds meter is reading zero so i'm gonna
take<00:03:04.440> off<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> last<00:03:04.890> canister<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.640> put<00:03:05.850> the

take off the last canister and put the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.990 
take off the last canister and put the
silica<00:03:06.510> Buster<00:03:06.930> filter<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.040> okay<00:03:08.670> put<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
silica Buster filter in okay put the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.009 
silica Buster filter in okay put the
silica<00:03:09.420> Buster<00:03:09.840> filter<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.709> I'm<00:03:11.430> gonna<00:03:11.579> turn

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
silica Buster filter in I'm gonna turn

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:20.330 
silica Buster filter in I'm gonna turn
water<00:03:13.019> back<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:18.709> I'm<00:03:19.709> gonna<00:03:19.799> set<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> right

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
water back on I'm gonna set the right

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.330 
water back on I'm gonna set the right
side<00:03:20.930> TDS<00:03:21.930> meter<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.410> out<00:03:22.560> now<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:25.040> wait<00:03:26.040> until

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
side TDS meter to out now and wait until

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.800 
side TDS meter to out now and wait until
it<00:03:26.459> reads<00:03:26.840> zeros<00:03:29.060> all<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.180> I've<00:03:30.299> got<00:03:30.359> zeros

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
it reads zeros all right I've got zeros

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.880 
it reads zeros all right I've got zeros
now<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.670> right<00:03:32.900> TDS<00:03:33.900> meter<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.500> now<00:03:34.680> we're

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
now on the right TDS meter so now we're

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.220 
now on the right TDS meter so now we're
gonna<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.670> we're<00:03:36.299> gonna<00:03:36.450> test<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
gonna go and we're gonna test the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.910 
gonna go and we're gonna test the
concentration<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> water<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:40.709> first

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
concentration of the water the first

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.319 
concentration of the water the first
thing<00:03:41.100> we<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.459> check<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.970> concentration

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
thing we do to check the concentration

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.930 
thing we do to check the concentration
is<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.410> let<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> system<00:03:43.829> run<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.790> five

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
is to let the system run for five

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.530 
is to let the system run for five
minutes<00:03:45.680> all<00:03:46.680> right<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.980> then<00:03:47.269> take<00:03:48.269> some

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
minutes all right and then take some

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.180 
minutes all right and then take some
sort<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.290> container<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.890> let<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> water

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
sort of container and you let the water

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.340 
sort of container and you let the water
from<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:54.269> wastewater<00:03:54.630> line<00:03:55.019> which<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.319> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
from the the wastewater line which is a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.819 
from the the wastewater line which is a
yellow<00:03:55.850> running<00:03:56.850> here<00:03:57.000> for<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> minute<00:03:57.829> save

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
yellow running here for a minute save

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.170 
yellow running here for a minute save
the<00:03:58.980> water<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.340> find<00:03:59.549> out<00:03:59.669> how<00:03:59.790> much<00:03:59.910> there<00:04:00.150> is

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the water and find out how much there is

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.360 
the water and find out how much there is
and<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:01.350> do<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> exact<00:04:01.799> same<00:04:01.949> thing<00:04:02.160> for<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
and you do the exact same thing for the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.309 
and you do the exact same thing for the
blue<00:04:02.549> and

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
blue and

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.349 
blue and
then<00:04:05.530> there's<00:04:05.709> like<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.859> an<00:04:06.730> equation<00:04:06.969> but

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
then there's like a an equation but

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.599 
then there's like a an equation but
we'll<00:04:07.510> get<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:09.090> alright<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.340> what<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.370> do

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
we'll get to that alright so what you do

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.989 
we'll get to that alright so what you do
to<00:04:12.730> get<00:04:12.849> your<00:04:13.650> waste<00:04:14.650> water<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:15.219> product<00:04:15.819> water

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:15.999 
to get your waste water to product water

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:20.189 
to get your waste water to product water
ratio<00:04:16.769> did<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:17.859> first<00:04:18.130> take<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.690> amounts<00:04:20.079> of

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
ratio did you first take the amounts of

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.310 
ratio did you first take the amounts of
your<00:04:20.380> waste<00:04:21.370> water<00:04:21.720> amounts<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.840> your<00:04:22.930> product

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
your waste water amounts of your product

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.529 
your waste water amounts of your product
water<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.800> had<00:04:24.639> them<00:04:24.759> in<00:04:24.820> cups<00:04:25.060> cuz<00:04:25.330> that's<00:04:25.479> the

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
water I had them in cups cuz that's the

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.219 
water I had them in cups cuz that's the
only<00:04:25.750> kind<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:25.990> measuring<00:04:26.410> thing<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.460> had<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:29.169> I

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
only kind of measuring thing I had so I

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.820 
only kind of measuring thing I had so I
had<00:04:29.349> a<00:04:29.410> half<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.710> cup<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.039> product<00:04:31.030> water<00:04:31.240> and

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
had a half a cup of product water and

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.800 
had a half a cup of product water and
one<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.009> three-eighths<00:04:33.340> cup<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.820> waste<00:04:34.539> water

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
one and three-eighths cup of waste water

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.870 
one and three-eighths cup of waste water
so<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.500> converted<00:04:35.830> those<00:04:36.099> two<00:04:36.220> decimals<00:04:36.669> which

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
so I converted those two decimals which

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.900 
so I converted those two decimals which
became<00:04:37.710> one<00:04:38.710> point<00:04:38.919> three<00:04:39.070> seven<00:04:39.310> five<00:04:39.580> and

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
became one point three seven five and

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.650 
became one point three seven five and
point<00:04:40.180> five<00:04:40.590> then<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.680> brought<00:04:41.889> them<00:04:42.009> down<00:04:42.160> I

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
point five then I brought them down I

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.339 
point five then I brought them down I
don't<00:04:43.660> know<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:43.810> you're<00:04:43.900> familiar<00:04:44.080> with

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
don't know if you're familiar with

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.200 
don't know if you're familiar with
conversion<00:04:44.949> factors<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.789> can<00:04:45.910> just<00:04:46.030> do<00:04:46.180> a

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
conversion factors but you can just do a

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.390 
conversion factors but you can just do a
simple<00:04:46.570> conversion<00:04:46.900> factor<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.800> make<00:04:48.220> it

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
simple conversion factor to make it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.589 
simple conversion factor to make it
milliliters<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:50.560> put<00:04:50.770> your<00:04:51.419> given<00:04:52.419> which

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
milliliters so you put your given which

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.560 
milliliters so you put your given which
is<00:04:52.750> one<00:04:52.870> point<00:04:53.050> three<00:04:53.320> seven<00:04:53.530> cups<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.300> under

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
is one point three seven cups and under

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.110 
is one point three seven cups and under
here<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:55.870> put<00:04:56.020> one<00:04:56.259> cup<00:04:56.530> equals<00:04:57.130> two<00:04:57.880> point

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
here you put one cup equals two point

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.770 
here you put one cup equals two point
I'm<00:04:58.930> sorry<00:04:59.199> to<00:04:59.470> 236<00:05:00.370> milliliters<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.090> one

equals<00:05:04.330> 320<00:05:05.259> 4.5<00:05:06.190> milliliters<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.360> then<00:05:08.020> you

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
equals 320 4.5 milliliters and then you

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.560 
equals 320 4.5 milliliters and then you
do<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.320> same<00:05:08.560> for<00:05:10.560> your<00:05:11.560> product<00:05:12.039> water

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
do the same for your product water

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.180 
do the same for your product water
alright<00:05:13.570> then<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.840> bring<00:05:13.990> them<00:05:14.080> down<00:05:14.259> you

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
alright then you bring them down you

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.439 
alright then you bring them down you
divide<00:05:15.490> your<00:05:15.780> waste<00:05:16.780> water<00:05:16.930> by<00:05:17.650> your<00:05:17.800> product

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
divide your waste water by your product

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.890 
divide your waste water by your product
and<00:05:19.449> you<00:05:19.659> get<00:05:19.780> two<00:05:20.440> point<00:05:20.680> seven<00:05:21.039> five<00:05:21.220> and

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
and you get two point seven five and

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.600 
and you get two point seven five and
then<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:22.990> bring<00:05:23.139> that<00:05:23.289> down<00:05:23.530> so<00:05:24.190> two<00:05:24.250> point

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
then you bring that down so two point

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.110 
then you bring that down so two point
seven<00:05:24.909> five<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:26.229> one<00:05:26.440> is<00:05:26.710> my<00:05:27.340> ratio<00:05:27.880> for

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
seven five to one is my ratio for

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.260 
seven five to one is my ratio for
wastewater<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.380> product<00:05:29.740> water<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.270> of

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
wastewater to product water and of

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.210 
wastewater to product water and of
course<00:05:31.479> that's<00:05:32.289> not<00:05:32.530> good<00:05:32.740> because<00:05:33.070> it's

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
course that's not good because it's

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.820 
course that's not good because it's
supposed<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.460> be<00:05:33.610> between<00:05:34.240> three<00:05:34.750> three<00:05:35.710> two

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
supposed to be between three three two

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.860 
supposed to be between three three two
one<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.159> six<00:05:36.430> two<00:05:36.550> one<00:05:36.699> so<00:05:37.570> now<00:05:37.659> I'm<00:05:37.780> gonna

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
one and six two one so now I'm gonna

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.749 
one and six two one so now I'm gonna
have<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.050> take<00:05:38.259> out<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:39.419> flow<00:05:40.419> regulator<00:05:41.050> and

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
have to take out the flow regulator and

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.580 
have to take out the flow regulator and
cut<00:05:42.759> it<00:05:42.880> down<00:05:43.000> so<00:05:43.300> I'll<00:05:44.050> show<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:44.320> how<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.409> do

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
cut it down so I'll show you how to do

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.149 
cut it down so I'll show you how to do
that<00:05:44.710> next

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
that next

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.850 
that next
alright<00:05:45.909> so<00:05:46.000> what<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.150> got<00:05:46.300> here<00:05:46.509> is<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.860> little

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
alright so what I got here is the little

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.390 
alright so what I got here is the little
fitting<00:05:48.219> that<00:05:48.699> was<00:05:48.789> on<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.830> membrane<00:05:50.830> on<00:05:51.130> top

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
fitting that was on the membrane on top

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.700 
fitting that was on the membrane on top
of<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:52.199> already<00:05:53.199> I<00:05:53.250> system<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:55.710> wastewater

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
of the already I system and wastewater

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.469 
of the already I system and wastewater
line<00:05:57.130> here<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:57.759> you<00:05:57.820> can<00:05:57.969> see<00:05:58.150> there's<00:05:58.330> like<00:05:58.419> a

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
line here and you can see there's like a

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.490 
line here and you can see there's like a
little<00:05:58.690> black<00:05:59.020> that's<00:05:59.949> the<00:06:00.099> flow<00:06:00.550> resistor

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
little black that's the flow resistor

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.800 
little black that's the flow resistor
restrictor<00:06:02.500> sorry<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.610> I'm<00:06:03.729> gonna<00:06:03.849> pull<00:06:04.690> it

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
restrictor sorry and I'm gonna pull it

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.649 
restrictor sorry and I'm gonna pull it
out<00:06:04.960> now<00:06:05.280> alright<00:06:06.280> so<00:06:06.460> that's<00:06:06.639> the<00:06:06.729> flow

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
out now alright so that's the flow

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.339 
out now alright so that's the flow
restrictor<00:06:08.969> and<00:06:09.969> I'm<00:06:10.150> gonna<00:06:10.270> cut<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:10.960> down<00:06:11.139> now

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
restrictor and I'm gonna cut it down now

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.350 
restrictor and I'm gonna cut it down now
that's<00:06:12.039> all<00:06:12.190> gonna<00:06:12.340> depend<00:06:12.699> on<00:06:12.909> what<00:06:13.120> your

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
that's all gonna depend on what your

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.689 
that's all gonna depend on what your
ratio<00:06:14.320> was<00:06:14.590> and<00:06:14.860> there's<00:06:15.010> a<00:06:15.070> chart<00:06:15.430> in<00:06:15.580> the

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
ratio was and there's a chart in the

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.590 
ratio was and there's a chart in the
manual<00:06:16.210> you<00:06:16.419> can<00:06:17.139> figure<00:06:17.320> it<00:06:17.500> out

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
manual you can figure it out

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.230 
manual you can figure it out
okay<00:06:19.600> so<00:06:19.660> I<00:06:19.870> put<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:21.400> flow<00:06:21.610> restrictor<00:06:22.060> back

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
okay so I put the flow restrictor back

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.590 
okay so I put the flow restrictor back
in<00:06:22.420> the<00:06:22.570> waste<00:06:23.200> water<00:06:23.320> line<00:06:23.740> and<00:06:24.600> reinstalled

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
in the waste water line and reinstalled

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.810 
in the waste water line and reinstalled
it<00:06:25.750> on<00:06:25.840> the<00:06:25.930> system<00:06:26.140> here<00:06:26.350> and<00:06:26.820> recalculated

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
it on the system here and recalculated

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.150 
it on the system here and recalculated
the<00:06:28.090> ratio<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.110> now<00:06:29.350> I'm<00:06:29.470> good<00:06:29.680> I'm<00:06:29.890> within

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
the ratio and now I'm good I'm within

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.110 
the ratio and now I'm good I'm within
the<00:06:30.310> three<00:06:31.240> to<00:06:31.360> one<00:06:31.540> and<00:06:31.750> six<00:06:32.710> to<00:06:32.830> one<00:06:33.000> so<00:06:34.000> now

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
the three to one and six to one so now

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.870 
the three to one and six to one so now
I'm<00:06:34.240> gonna<00:06:34.890> try<00:06:35.890> to<00:06:35.950> run<00:06:36.190> this<00:06:36.310> line<00:06:36.580> all<00:06:36.790> the

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
I'm gonna try to run this line all the

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.210 
I'm gonna try to run this line all the
way<00:06:36.910> to<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.180> tank<00:06:37.830> so<00:06:38.830> I'm<00:06:38.920> gonna<00:06:39.010> have<00:06:39.160> to

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
way to the tank so I'm gonna have to

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.180 
way to the tank so I'm gonna have to
carry<00:06:39.730> buckets<00:06:39.970> of<00:06:40.240> water<00:06:40.330> all<00:06:40.570> day<00:06:40.980> okay<00:06:41.980> so<00:06:42.040> I

where<00:07:37.000> you<00:07:37.090> want<00:07:37.300> it<00:07:37.360> because<00:07:37.480> it's<00:07:37.660> gonna<00:07:37.750> be

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
where you want it because it's gonna be

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.910 
where you want it because it's gonna be
really<00:07:37.960> heavy<00:07:38.350> if<00:07:38.650> you<00:07:38.770> try<00:07:38.920> to<00:07:38.980> move<00:07:39.160> it<00:07:39.280> and

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:40.920 
really heavy if you try to move it and

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.010 
really heavy if you try to move it and
make<00:07:41.920> sure<00:07:41.950> it's<00:07:42.220> level<00:07:42.660> that's<00:07:43.660> just<00:07:43.930> my

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.020 
make sure it's level that's just my

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.530 
make sure it's level that's just my
iPhone<00:07:44.500> up<00:07:44.710> there<00:07:44.950> I<00:07:45.330> don't<00:07:46.330> know<00:07:46.480> how

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:46.540 
iPhone up there I don't know how

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.000 
iPhone up there I don't know how
accurate<00:07:47.080> they<00:07:47.200> are<00:07:47.230> but<00:07:47.440> that's<00:07:47.500> all<00:07:47.710> I<00:07:47.740> had

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010 
accurate they are but that's all I had

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.920 
accurate they are but that's all I had
so<00:07:48.310> it<00:07:48.910> looks<00:07:49.090> pretty<00:07:49.300> close<00:07:49.540> and<00:07:51.630> that's<00:07:52.630> it

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
so it looks pretty close and that's it

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.770 
so it looks pretty close and that's it
