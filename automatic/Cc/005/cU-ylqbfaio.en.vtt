like<00:06:40.589> I've<00:06:40.770> said<00:06:40.949> this<00:06:41.099> forever<00:06:41.460> I've<00:06:41.789> always

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
like I've said this forever I've always

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.450 
like I've said this forever I've always
wanted<00:06:42.659> to<00:06:43.020> be<00:06:43.229> a<00:06:43.259> part<00:06:43.469> of<00:06:43.589> something<00:06:43.830> big<00:06:44.249> of

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
wanted to be a part of something big of

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.709 
wanted to be a part of something big of
a<00:06:44.719> revolution<00:06:45.719> and<00:06:46.819> the<00:06:47.819> educational<00:06:48.569> system

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719 
a revolution and the educational system

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.350 
a revolution and the educational system
right<00:06:49.080> now<00:06:49.110> means<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.889> revolution<00:06:50.520> and<00:06:50.729> I<00:06:51.089> think

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
right now means a revolution and I think

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.839 
right now means a revolution and I think
this<00:06:51.509> is<00:06:51.719> one<00:06:52.020> small<00:06:52.379> if<00:06:52.680> it's<00:06:53.159> just<00:06:53.430> even<00:06:53.610> a

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
this is one small if it's just even a

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.820 
this is one small if it's just even a
dent<00:06:54.089> I<00:06:54.389> think<00:06:54.930> that<00:06:55.110> we're<00:06:55.319> headed<00:06:55.620> in<00:06:55.710> the

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
dent I think that we're headed in the

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.439 
dent I think that we're headed in the
direction<00:06:55.860> of<00:06:56.490> really<00:06:56.849> changing<00:06:57.300> and

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
direction of really changing and

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.559 
direction of really changing and
improving<00:06:57.539> the<00:06:57.960> educational<00:06:58.710> system<00:06:58.889> and

00:06:59.559 --> 00:06:59.569 
improving the educational system and

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.179 
improving the educational system and
obviously<00:07:00.569> that<00:07:00.689> means<00:07:00.900> that<00:07:01.289> it's<00:07:01.499> a<00:07:01.680> huge

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.189 
obviously that means that it's a huge

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.149 
obviously that means that it's a huge
job<00:07:02.389> so<00:07:03.389> Kip<00:07:04.050> is<00:07:04.259> for<00:07:04.499> you<00:07:04.650> if<00:07:04.889> you<00:07:05.129> are
