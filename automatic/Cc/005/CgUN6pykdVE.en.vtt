so three lovers in this one and let's
look<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> base<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.559> try<00:00:41.040> notice<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
look at this base and try notice the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.220 
look at this base and try notice the
advantage<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:44.780> by<00:00:45.780> attacking

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
advantage that you can get by attacking

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.490 
advantage that you can get by attacking
it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.479 
it
so<00:00:47.360> while<00:00:48.360> attacking<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.800> first<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.399> all

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so while attacking it so first of all

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
so while attacking it so first of all
notice<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.059> those<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.840> defenses<00:00:52.410> are

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
notice that those two your defenses are

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.250 
notice that those two your defenses are
pretty<00:00:53.550> close<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> edge<00:00:54.600> edges<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> only

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
pretty close to the edge edges and only

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
pretty close to the edge edges and only
cannons

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
cannons

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.049 
cannons
are<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> way<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
are on the way to them so one of the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
are on the way to them so one of the
balloons<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.510> sent<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> cannons<00:01:01.260> they're

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
balloons are sent to the cannons they're

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.910 
balloons are sent to the cannons they're
gonna<00:01:01.620> probably<00:01:02.399> split<00:01:03.559> into<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.799> air

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
gonna probably split into the air

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.750 
gonna probably split into the air
defense<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.180> waste<00:01:06.390> our<00:01:06.600> taking<00:01:07.110> them

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
defense and the waste our taking them

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
defense and the waste our taking them
both<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.180> their<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> right

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
both on their way and with the right

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.050 
both on their way and with the right
reach<00:01:11.460> both<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.390> gonna<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:13.110> easy<00:01:14.060> one

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
reach both it's gonna be pretty easy one

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
reach both it's gonna be pretty easy one
thing<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.780> most<00:01:16.350> important<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
thing and most important thing that you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.390 
thing and most important thing that you
should<00:01:17.640> notice<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.409> this<00:01:19.409> Inferno<00:01:20.100> tower

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
should notice is that this Inferno tower

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.810 
should notice is that this Inferno tower
is<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.180> multi<00:01:21.930> target<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> multi<00:01:23.250> target<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
is on multi target and multi target is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
is on multi target and multi target is
the<00:01:24.180> worst<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.570> get<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.350> doing

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the worst you can get when you're doing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
the worst you can get when you're doing
a<00:01:28.890> balloon<00:01:29.189> attack<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.420> gonna<00:01:30.600> take

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
a balloon attack because it's gonna take

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.450 
a balloon attack because it's gonna take
down<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.710> balloons<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.430> luckily<00:01:33.420> one

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
down all of your balloons so luckily one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.870 
down all of your balloons so luckily one
is<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.790> single<00:01:36.270> target<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> left<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.880> if

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is on single target the left one and if

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.240 
is on single target the left one and if
they<00:01:39.119> were<00:01:39.450> switched<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.710> left<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.070> was

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
they were switched and the left one was

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
they were switched and the left one was
multi<00:01:41.700> target<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:42.960> much

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
multi target it would be much much

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
multi target it would be much much
harder<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.159> base<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:45.240> Easter<00:01:45.689> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
harder to get this base for Easter so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
harder to get this base for Easter so
the<00:01:46.110> fact<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.649> multi<00:01:47.100> target<00:01:47.899> Inferno

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the fact that this multi target Inferno

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
the fact that this multi target Inferno
is<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.250> Queen<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.610> over

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
is on the right and the Queen is over

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.030 
is on the right and the Queen is over
there<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.750> air<00:01:51.899> defense<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.500> over<00:01:52.829> there

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
there and the air defense is over there

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.810 
there and the air defense is over there
makes<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.810> choice<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.070> third<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
makes the choice of the third of the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.080 
makes the choice of the third of the
attack<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:58.020> easy<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> gonna<00:01:59.790> start

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
attack very easy so is it gonna start

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
attack very easy so is it gonna start
with<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> golem<00:02:01.310> phew<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.890> some<00:02:04.890> wall

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
with a golem phew is and some wall

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.029 
with a golem phew is and some wall
breakers<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.320> through<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> wall<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
breakers to get through the wall and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.520 
breakers to get through the wall and
into<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.849> section<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.539> let's<00:02:09.569> delete<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.319> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
into that section so let's delete all of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.520 
into that section so let's delete all of
that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.000 
that
so<00:02:11.860> basically<00:02:12.460> his<00:02:13.360> heroes<00:02:13.960> under<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.680> golem

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
so basically his heroes under the golem

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.530 
so basically his heroes under the golem
shield<00:02:15.250> are<00:02:15.490> gonna<00:02:15.760> take<00:02:16.120> down<00:02:17.070> all<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.340> those

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
shield are gonna take down all of those

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.960 
shield are gonna take down all of those
defenses<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.810> make<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:22.270> way<00:02:22.450> for<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> Queen

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970

defenses and make the way for the Queen
very<00:02:24.970> very<00:02:25.270> clear<00:02:25.690> into<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.230> internet<00:02:26.680> hours

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
very very clear into the internet hours

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.250 
very very clear into the internet hours
so<00:02:27.220> she<00:02:27.940> doesn't<00:02:28.120> even<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.840> get<00:02:29.020> through

so she doesn't even have to get through
the<00:02:29.380> wall<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:30.430> gonna<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.820> enough<00:02:31.060> if<00:02:31.390> the

and the other air defense which was left

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.500 
and the other air defense which was left
so<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.590> guess<00:03:44.590> no<00:03:45.280> need<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.640> talk<00:03:45.850> too<00:03:46.030> much<00:03:46.239> on

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
so I guess no need to talk too much on

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.410 
so I guess no need to talk too much on
this<00:03:46.720> one<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.549> we<00:03:48.549> better<00:03:48.790> see<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.209> attack
