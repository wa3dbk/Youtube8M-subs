recording I should try but I never have

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.390 
recording I should try but I never have
so<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.630> try<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.310> one<00:01:35.310> time<00:01:35.580> soon

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
so I will try that one time soon

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.090 
so I will try that one time soon
do<00:01:37.940> I<00:01:37.970> have<00:01:38.120> no<00:01:38.300> idea<00:01:38.390> how<00:01:38.570> Allah<00:01:38.660> can<00:01:38.810> work

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
do I have no idea how Allah can work

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.310 
do I have no idea how Allah can work
Yorick<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.220> gravedigger<00:01:40.880> he<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.810> champion

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
Yorick the gravedigger he is a champion

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.580 
Yorick the gravedigger he is a champion
that<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:42.890> can<00:01:43.070> select<00:01:43.480> he<00:01:44.480> is<00:01:44.660> a<00:01:44.930> well<00:01:45.440> has

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
that you can select he is a well has

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.590 
that you can select he is a well has
attributes<00:01:46.010> say<00:01:46.430> pusher<00:01:46.850> fighter<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.300> melee

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
attributes say pusher fighter in melee

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.780 
attributes say pusher fighter in melee
so<00:01:47.660> he<00:01:47.990> does<00:01:48.140> all<00:01:48.980> right<00:01:49.190> but<00:01:49.370> if<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.550> look<00:01:49.700> at

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
so he does all right but if you look at

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.670 
so he does all right but if you look at
his<00:01:49.910> stats<00:01:50.300> he<00:01:50.570> doesn't<00:01:50.810> look<00:01:50.900> like<00:01:51.050> he's<00:01:51.170> he's

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
reach it smells average and the

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.640 
reach it smells average and the
difficulty<00:01:57.350> use<00:01:57.650> them<00:01:57.800> is<00:01:57.920> easy<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:58.850> mean
