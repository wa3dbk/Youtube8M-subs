00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.370
 how 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.370
 ah 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 very good everyone here today as always 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
 with more peace fill 4 and this is the time in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.369
 which I'm basically reliving 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
 series today I bring you another episode of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.400
 personalized class for those who are 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 new say we were not in the channel 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.170
 I have not posted a video like 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 this one grabbed anything from life 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 real and tried to replicate it in what it is 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 butterfield let's say it's mostly done 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.960
 what are armies or forces 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 police around the world but with 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.949
 the theme that desert inn came out in the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.989
 game and from basically I knew that I was going to 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.119
 out I knew that sooner or later I was going to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 end up being a video like this one in 

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:46.049
 this case I am using the rifle 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.119
 96 sniper and as a weapon 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.920
 secondary I have to be the obviously 

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.659
 which as you can see now on the screen 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.119
 Try painting to make it look more 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.729
 less like that of counter strike 1.6 not 

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:59.220
 it was completely the same or identical let's say 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.500
 but you can give an idea in the case 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.540
 of 96 as you can see now also you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.820
 I put a camouflage something like green the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.640
 look for 8 and the straight bolt and nothing else 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.020
 but how are you going to see the course of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840
 this video in which a bit I'm 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.580
 attacking in flavor 311 a game of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.490
 rolls high and in another little I'm 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.590
 defending but the truth is that in addition 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 of this I do not have any kind of 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.520
 accessory let's say your equipment but 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.190
 I also achieve a lot of help to my 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.570
 team since in 96 allows me inside 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.030
 of which somehow aggressive 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.500
 and in that of serving as a secondary weapon 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.780
 being one of the best but the best 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 of the game allows me to do the same 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.240
 also not only keep me in the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.710
 let's say the battle front but I 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 allows me to move around the map with 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.580
 a little more security because that yes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.080
 I know I have a chance to face 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.750
 one on one against most 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.759
 assault rifles carbines and so on 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.729
 etcetera because as I say I have the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.380
 serve as a secondary weapon now the one of 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.610
 96 has a small problem there 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.100
 it's just a sniper rifle 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 which comes with the lcd chain to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.789
 rising that is if you do not have the dlc of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.320
 chain already raising or do not have premium no 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.360
 they will be able to unlock it but 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.149
 have a more important problem yet 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.130
 which is that he loses in almost all 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.660
 statistics against the magnum goal the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.960
 which comes with the lcd one 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.910
 of Genueve of s with two outs because 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.130
 they lose almost all the statistics in 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 which loses better said good the only 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.480
 that basically earn is in the charger 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.190
 that has 11 bullets let's say 10 plus one 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.750
 in the bedroom while the goal 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.760
 magnum has five plus one in the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.830
 bedroom in the rest is losing 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.350
 shoots in a slower way 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.750
 bullets travel less distance travel from 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.520
 a slower way also does not have 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.770
 more bullet fall but I think that 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240
 he's practically losing in almost 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.610
 all statistics let's say also 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.470
 slower recharge in 96 I do not have them 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.090
 right now on the screen I'm not 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.510
 reading but I remember what those were 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.550
 when I check it out so although this is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.500
 something thematic and many statistics 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.510
 they do not matter it's more like to good for 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.830
 remember to do a bit of memory for 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.020
 those who are probably afraid 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.470
 they played a lot with this configuration 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.840
 let's say go out buy what would be the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.600
 double pp against 1.6 strike and which 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.940
 is 96 in real life and one serving 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920
 as a secondary weapon , a lot of nostalgia 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.000
 let's say but in more than phil the truth is 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.590
 that does not stop working and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.480
 I would recommend that whenever you can 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.550
 use the magnum goal 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.690
 is that that amount of bullets in a 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.090
 receive the sniper do not have 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.409
 too much importance since the great 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.480
 most of the time we will not be 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.090
 using all the bullets before being able to 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.129
 get a fraction of time let's say 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.019
 a break to be able 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.690
 basically reload our rifle 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.760
 sniper and while this class 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.680
 let's say this configuration is not for 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
 nothing bad and if I could get some 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.769
 good games I guess the great 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.840
 Most of you also do not have 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.610
 no skill in what is bad feel 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 4 with sniper rifles 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.450
 I have very few deaths the truth is that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.829
 I had kept away from them 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.750
 especially for what was the subject of the 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.120
 narco at the beginning during the first 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.440
 months of the game and after all I do not 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.640
 had finished convincing what they were 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.530
 the mechanics with the reflex 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.239
 sniper still do not finish me 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.129
 convince me I think they need a 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.629
 little bit of help a little bit of balance 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.910
 here already to do a little more damage 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.400
 to what is medium and short distances 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.019
 but as I already tell you if I could get out 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.090
 good games I calculate that you 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.680
 they can also but after all they do not 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.750
 I can finish recommending you this 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 class to use it let's say day by day 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.580
 or as a class as too useful 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.870
 as I mentioned earlier the n96 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.030
 loses in almost all is 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.910
 against the magnum which I recommend 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.470
 much more than the 96 l and on top of that 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.300
 I almost do not have any accessories in my 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.919
 weapons and I do not have any equipment not 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.380
 I can take my team with what they are 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.449
 spokes lighthouses or spawn because in English and 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.250
 I do not have anything to recognize the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.139
 battlefield let's say to estoquear 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.530
 or mark enemies as what would be a 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.669
 looks or maps or why those balls 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.370
 that are thrown that I do not remember how 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.190
 they call motion bag this or if the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.000
 sensor balls whatever but 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.289
 basically not a bad class is not 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.760
 bad equipment bad 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.680
 configuration but I can not 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.090
 finish recommending as I say 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.760
 I would make those changes that I mentioned 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.990
 but as always I hope that they 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.370
 have liked the video do not forget about 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.139
 leave me a recommendation that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.430
 I would like to see for next week 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.430
 see you next ciao
