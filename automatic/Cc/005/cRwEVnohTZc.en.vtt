00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 welcome you are watching a video review from 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.579
 sotmarket 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.189
 I present to your attention a casio watch 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:20.009
 sport series model pr g 240 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.839
 These watches are delivered as you see in 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:28.740
 such a rather large cardboard boxes 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:32.520
 inside which can be found in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 The first instructions are just like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.350
 kissing an encyclopedia of paper on her is clearly not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.770
 regretted well and also of course you can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770
 to find 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:52.370
 Now we cut and see what 's the same 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.370
 here you can find it so interesting 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.250
 the box is quite complicated and immediately 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.410
 open up and as you can notice in 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 this box is another one 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.580
 box 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.880
 it is wooden you will not believe 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.210
 at first I could not even understand how she 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 opens but on the side where there is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.640
 picture 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.479
 she moves away like this 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:28.930
 the cover is removed and here it all lies 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.930
 the handiwork themselves are the clock 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 here they open the bag get the clock and 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.880
 take a closer look at them 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:54.429
 need to remove naturally all unnecessary 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:02:01.509
 exactly the serial number tag do 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:05.920
 it's pretty simple and after that we 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.039
 look at the clock the watches have quite 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.410
 large size sporty design 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.060
 brutal there is a huge amount 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 various details 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.599
 looks of course cool despite 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.150
 dimensions weight is quite small and 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.630
 As for quality, everything is done very 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.610
 well screwed on screws of course 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.980
 because it is a shockproof watch on everything 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.750
 There is a wide variety of housing 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.799
 markup 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.370
 which provides a different 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.950
 user information here is in 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 this watch has a compass that turns on 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.480
 pushing a button 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.040
 works very well shows 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.480
 direction and number of degrees 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.540
 which you vole on as well 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.310
 there is a separate button here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.390
 inclusive barometer which is present 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 in this watch 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:12.360
 as well as a separate altimeter button all 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.110
 works just fine very useful 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.560
 for trekking 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:24.510
 on the bottom there is a button that includes 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.390
 backlight and adjust button 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.000
 which is needed in order to customize 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.330
 some data is also a button 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.520
 switch clock modes here 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:44.610

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:48.480
 as well as a stopwatch timer mode and 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:53.730
 the alarm clock and the top left is 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.739

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.470

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.080
 Rubber even more accurate to say everything very 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.600
 made comfortable 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.790
 on the back there is such a here 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.730
 matt lining that helps the skin 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.900
 breathe so to speak that is with her all 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.170
 it is much more comfortable that I am 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.950

 looks awesome besides everything 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.130
 other things worth mentioning of course 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.050
 that they are able to charge from the solar 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.980
 energy 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.990
 Well, to summarize, we can say that it is
