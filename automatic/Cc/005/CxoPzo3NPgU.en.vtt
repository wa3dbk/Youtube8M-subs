00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the time the water evaporates you may

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910 
the time the water evaporates you may
have<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> add<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.920> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
have to add a little bit more if you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
have to add a little bit more if you
know<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> waters<00:01:09.000> gone<00:01:09.150> before
