00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.909 

this<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.670> flexible<00:00:06.150> desk<00:00:06.390> lamp<00:00:06.919> basically

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
this is the flexible desk lamp basically

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.790 
this is the flexible desk lamp basically
it's<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.429> combination<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.179> materials<00:00:10.050> what

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
it's a combination of materials what

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.490 
it's a combination of materials what
I've<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.130> inside<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:12.059> timber<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.139> actually<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
I've got inside the timber is actually a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.220 
I've got inside the timber is actually a
sheet<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.160> aluminium<00:00:14.630> which<00:00:15.630> gives<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
sheet of aluminium which gives the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.640 
sheet of aluminium which gives the
timber<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.920> shape<00:00:17.310> holding<00:00:18.050> properties<00:00:19.050> so

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
timber some shape holding properties so

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.290 
timber some shape holding properties so
you're<00:00:19.800> able<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> then<00:00:20.340> bend<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> lamp<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you're able to then bend the lamp and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.900 
you're able to then bend the lamp and
twist<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.170> into<00:00:22.439> whatever<00:00:22.890> configuration<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
twist it into whatever configuration you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.259 
twist it into whatever configuration you
want<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:25.199> point<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> light<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.269> wherever

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
want and point the light in wherever

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.779 
want and point the light in wherever
direction<00:00:27.900> what<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> wanted<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.519> try

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
direction what I wanted to do was try

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.870 
direction what I wanted to do was try
and<00:00:29.910> push<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> boundaries<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.340> material

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and push the boundaries of the material

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.090 
and push the boundaries of the material
and<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.300> expect<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.260> normally<00:00:35.010> we

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and what we expect of it so normally we

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.560 
and what we expect of it so normally we
think<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.430> timber<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.030> rigid<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
think of timber is a very rigid and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.619 
think of timber is a very rigid and
static<00:00:37.280> material<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.910> wanted<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.300> create

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
static material and I wanted to create

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.740 
static material and I wanted to create
something<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.379> flexible<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
something that was very flexible and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.709 
something that was very flexible and
probably<00:00:42.750> bucked<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> trend<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.129> bit

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
probably bucked the trend a little bit

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.299 
probably bucked the trend a little bit
and<00:00:45.719> hence<00:00:45.960> why<00:00:46.170> I've<00:00:46.350> sort<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.590> played<00:00:47.100> around

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and hence why I've sort of played around

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.590 
and hence why I've sort of played around
with<00:00:47.430> laminations<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.239> different

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
with laminations with different

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
with laminations with different
different<00:00:49.530> materials<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> give<00:00:50.219> different

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
different materials to give different

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
different materials to give different
properties<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> idea<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> lamp<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
properties the idea with the lamp is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
properties the idea with the lamp is
that<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> electrics<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.100> integrated

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that all the electrics are integrated

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
that all the electrics are integrated
inside<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.050> we've<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.530> LEDs<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> top<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
inside so we've got LEDs at the top and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
inside so we've got LEDs at the top and
there's<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.899> wires<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> way

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there's all wires going all the way

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
there's all wires going all the way
through<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.370> lamp<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.020> wrapping<00:01:01.020> back

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
through the lamp and wrapping back

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650 
through the lamp and wrapping back
around<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.910> what<00:01:02.910> I've<00:01:03.030> done<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.239> instead<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
around and what I've done is instead of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
around and what I've done is instead of
having<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.019> normal<00:01:04.280> on/off<00:01:05.280> switch<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.090> using

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
having a normal on/off switch it's using

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
having a normal on/off switch it's using
the<00:01:06.750> flexible<00:01:07.200> nature<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.010> timber<00:01:08.369> as

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the flexible nature of the timber as

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
the flexible nature of the timber as
well<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.380> battery<00:01:10.380> pack<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:11.130> powers

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
well it has a battery pack which powers

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.210 
well it has a battery pack which powers
the<00:01:11.670> lamp<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:13.049> battery<00:01:13.409> pack<00:01:13.619> sits<00:01:14.040> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the lamp and the battery pack sits in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
the lamp and the battery pack sits in
beside<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.909> between<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:15.869> contact<00:01:16.350> points

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
beside in between the two contact points

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.550 
beside in between the two contact points
and<00:01:16.860> when<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> does<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.060> end<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> then

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and when it does that's end on and then

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.179 
and when it does that's end on and then
to<00:01:19.680> turn<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.159> simply<00:01:20.759> push<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.189> front

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
to turn it off you simply push the front

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
to turn it off you simply push the front
part<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> lamp<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.509> against<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> wooden

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
part of the lamp up against the wooden

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.789 
part of the lamp up against the wooden
stand

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
stand

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
stand
and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> breaks<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> electrical

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and then that breaks the electrical

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.620 
and then that breaks the electrical
contact<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.920> lamp<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> made<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> European

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
contact the lamp is made from a European

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.340 
contact the lamp is made from a European
beech<00:01:31.229> veneer<00:01:32.210> normally<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.509> European<00:01:34.200> beech

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
beech veneer normally the European beech

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
beech veneer normally the European beech
veneer<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.909> commercially<00:01:35.909> available<00:01:36.140> come<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
veneer is commercially available come in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
veneer is commercially available come in
a<00:01:37.350> 0.6<00:01:38.130> milk<00:01:38.430> thickness<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.570> order<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> make

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
a 0.6 milk thickness in order to make

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.249 
a 0.6 milk thickness in order to make
the<00:01:40.290> lamp<00:01:40.500> flexible<00:01:41.360> what<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the lamp flexible what I have to do is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
the lamp flexible what I have to do is
shave<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.290> essentially<00:01:46.290> use

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
shave them down so I essentially use

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.350 
shave them down so I essentially use
spokeshave<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.220> mount<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.939> onto<00:01:51.210> my

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
spokeshave and I then mount this onto my

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.350 
spokeshave and I then mount this onto my
workbench<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.890> proceed<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> take

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
workbench and I will proceed to take

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.219 
workbench and I will proceed to take
minuscule<00:01:55.350> layers<00:01:55.829> off<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.030> veneer<00:01:57.570> until<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
minuscule layers off the veneer until I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.550 
minuscule layers off the veneer until I
get<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> 0.4<00:01:59.759> mil<00:02:00.000> thickness<00:02:00.390> which<00:02:01.290> then

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
get to a 0.4 mil thickness which then

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.340 
get to a 0.4 mil thickness which then
allows<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.520> timber<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.570> quite<00:02:03.840> supple<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
allows the timber to be quite supple and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.709 
allows the timber to be quite supple and
flexible<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> hand<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.540> obviously

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
flexible in the hand and then obviously

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.890 
flexible in the hand and then obviously
pair<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.469> we

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
pair that we
