00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.449
 so but let's try to do as we were 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.970
 picture 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.250
 well, for example 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.859
 how on 5 on 5 you can do this 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.219
 will work at hometown 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.309
 is free 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.429
 that is the victim 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.980
 is done by the algorithm that he said 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 we want everything that we do on one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230
 side on increasingly sides 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 it's actually fours 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 For Russia 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.319
 Sergei 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.370
 four 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.120
 we did it 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.360
 one square 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.290
 prima want to make eyes yes 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290
 we can immediately partition got famous france 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.260
 2 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
 Sergei 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 always do the same operation 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.670
 but that's what happened 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.670
 on all sides the same 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.720
 But maybe 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.350
 or is it upside down 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.930
 so she was 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 that is, above it, but these three turned out 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.440
 all right us 2 3 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.930
 on this too 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.540
 minaev but here currencies are inspired 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.700
 wishes may 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.610
 first crank first 1 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.900
 whatever 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.190
 and here on this top kicked yes it was possible 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.470
 initially flip it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.610
 0 as you like 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580
 now how to defend and back 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.310
 put 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.160
 first he white promoting yes 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.310
 second article 2 layers 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.670
 then brown to collect 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.950
 single lane 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 coming back brown 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.280
 do not return 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.660
 at the same site did 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.040
 first return from Mozdok 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 he is a sphere 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.830
 everything is back for now try again 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.139
 whatever 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.849
 but at least sat asymmetrical though 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.749
 the former one of their family demanded something 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:13.539
 Denmark 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.349
 It turns out in different countries wrote 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.829
 unbalanced percent 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.219
 then he is difficult 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.360
 we play but one can be done too 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.649
 not allowed 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:22.749
 will do 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.159
 let's say third parties continue to be in this 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.289
 kind 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.269
 then a trainer is made some kind of smile 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.239
 nose and eyes yes 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.029
 but here we are 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 on a surface 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:43.289
 with her 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.679
 with 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.279
 now i want a deal will give a pen here and 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
 there was luck here 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.859
 all this 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.549
 after trial 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.459
 our country should get 100 soms 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.989
 Now you need to change homes in 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.349
 principle central 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.509
 smoking but what's the difference 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.509
 let's two of their month 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.029
 I didnâ€™t take it but eyes too 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.129
 extreme 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.729
 or maybe there too 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.729
 franz 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.669
 but it looks like xiv 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.669
 we don't know, it's something like yes 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.059
 but further 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.049
 think for yourself you can you think these 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.309
 different figures 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.669
 Sergey accounts are the same 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
 or something else 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.789
 and make the answer to this see lateral 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:05.949
 village and get 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.509
 if you figures asymmetrical 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.409
 what then it turns out more difficult 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.459
 need to pre-deployed 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.949
 the side 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.120
 in other countries, for example, 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.689
 condemned these letters 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.819
 then she slaves pillows turn 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:20.900
 this side is right 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.219
 in order to 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.219
 all letters were symmetrical 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.330
 that night 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.240
 now you have something to think about with this 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.449
 dice and send as if the answer saw 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.469
 answers 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.469
 we'll see what you have 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.279
 but on this general, that was all 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.830
 in Rostov 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.449
 in detroit city 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.699
 not looking for human inventors two 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.639
 any 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.759
 for impudence to the commander of the emergency 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.389
 to pronounce but I tried 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.249
 but thank you for choosing 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.059
 how much time for this thing 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.240
 but trust me i spent more 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.620
 that's where the next cubes are so far
