00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.160 
to tighten it up here and you do that
until<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> gets<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.790> snug<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.450> around<00:01:57.899> on

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
until it gets kind of snug up around on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.230 
until it gets kind of snug up around on
both<00:01:58.590> sides<00:01:59.719> it's<00:02:00.719> also<00:02:00.990> woven<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:02.219> such<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> way

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
both sides it's also woven in such a way

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
both sides it's also woven in such a way
so<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.409> form-fitting

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
so it's a little bit more form-fitting

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.469 
so it's a little bit more form-fitting
to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> body<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.970> 13<00:02:08.970> below<00:02:09.209> wind

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
