 in 1 with 1 video and this time we're going to 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.950
 do something simple that is going to be water 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.720
 for the iron what will it consist of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.490
 this water is good because it's going to be water 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.529
 perfumed with the scent that we 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 We want what it is going to consist 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.900
 need demineralized water is worth or 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.930
 We are going to need Paul and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.699
 20 sorbate that is going to be a sun use 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.859
 you're worth it's what's going to make the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.660
 water and oil dissolve and a 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.579
 aromatic essence or a counter type 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.079
 we can take the counter type of our 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 favorite colony we can catch a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.070
 aromatic essence that we like we can 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.829
 catch an essential oil that we like 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 the smell we want is worth 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 paul and sorbato 20 what he's going to do is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 dissolve or mix that percentage that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 let's use water with the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 percentage of oil and well it's going 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.979
 to be that a water for the iron 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.570
 perfect and with the aroma that most 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.719
 like not the ones that sell out there that are 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.399
 floral or that are marine worth so 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.300
 nothing left you with the video and I hope that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.910
 I like you 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.910
 we will need 2 grams of essence 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.900
 aromatic or contratype 12 grams of paul 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.950
 and sorbate 20 and 200 grams of water 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.750
 demineralized or lifted ion 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 then here you see the essences what 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.800
 first thing we're going to do is take a 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.170
 essence or a counter type the amount that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.230
 we have put you already see that it is little 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.180
 but it will aromatize all the water that 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.250
 let's throw the following the cop and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.420
 Sorbato because it's a sun they use tea and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.020
 we throw the amount that we have 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.960
 indicated 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.179
 and after throwing it we go measuring 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.579
 all the ingredients and stir well 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.640
 with a wooden stick or with this 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.590
 rod for example we stir well and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.969
 then what we are going to do is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.969
 catch the demineralized water 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.600
 and we throw it out we throw up the amount 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.600
 what we have indicated 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.460
 after casting the amount what 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.280
 let's do is stir well 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.200
 and the truth is that the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.930
 aroma when we throw with the spray to the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.760
 clothes are appreciated and this lasts 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.380
 enough time you're not going to have 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.690
 no problem when using it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.450
 does not stain clothes and even trying on 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.000
 cotton fabric we have thrown on fabric 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 white does not stain absolutely anything and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.860
 then it is simply good 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.170
 throw it in a little jar, throw it in a 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.830
 spray and use it I leave you with the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.830
 final result 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.140
 and the final result would be this already 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.490
 we would have our water for the iron 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.850
 we have prepared it in two formats 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.580
 because for one simple reason this one 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.460
 we can throw in the water of the deposit 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.710
 when we iron all the clothes of a 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.870
 person is worth so that it smells like an aroma 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.820
 but for example if we want the clothes 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.090
 of our partner our husband smells 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.030
 one fragrance and ours to another 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.530
 we pour water in the normal tank and 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.540
 then with a spray what we will do 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.730
 spray on clothing as 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.460
 We are ironing well so everyone 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.040
 It would have its aroma and nothing else you see something 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.160
 completely customizable that does not 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.720
 stain that we can do it at home and 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.820
 that leaves a good aroma because that's what 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.290
 we like it so nothing that 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.670
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.670
 See you next time
