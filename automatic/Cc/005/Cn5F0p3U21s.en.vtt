about<00:01:11.020> 160<00:01:11.680> miles<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.070> was<00:01:12.160> pretty<00:01:12.280> exciting

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
about 160 miles it was pretty exciting

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.480 
about 160 miles it was pretty exciting
optics<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:14.140> then<00:01:14.259> on<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.560> telescope<00:01:15.100> we

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
optics and then on that telescope we

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.719 
optics and then on that telescope we
could<00:01:15.700> see<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.810> warhead<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.710> dummy<00:01:17.950> warhead

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
could see the warhead the dummy warhead

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.150 
could see the warhead the dummy warhead
according<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.660> Jacobs<00:01:20.170> at<00:01:20.380> this<00:01:20.619> stage<00:01:20.920> the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
according to Jacobs at this stage the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.040 
according to Jacobs at this stage the
rocket<00:01:21.520> was<00:01:21.640> traveling<00:01:22.149> between<00:01:22.479> eleven<00:01:22.929> and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
rocket was traveling between eleven and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.410 
rocket was traveling between eleven and
fourteen<00:01:23.410> thousand<00:01:24.160> miles<00:01:24.369> per<00:01:24.640> hour<00:01:24.789> when<00:01:25.390> a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
fourteen thousand miles per hour when a

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.529 
fourteen thousand miles per hour when a
saucer-shaped<00:01:25.960> craft<00:01:26.380> entered<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.310> frame<00:01:27.610> it

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
saucer-shaped craft entered the frame it

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.660 
saucer-shaped craft entered the frame it
flew<00:01:28.869> into<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.110> frame<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.550> it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
flew into the frame like this and it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.859 
flew into the frame like this and it
shot<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:30.970> beam<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.390> light<00:01:31.420> at<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.200> warhead<00:01:33.869> now

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
shot a beam of light at the warhead now

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.389 
shot a beam of light at the warhead now
remember<00:01:35.380> all<00:01:35.500> this<00:01:35.619> stuff<00:01:35.679> is<00:01:35.950> flying<00:01:36.130> at

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
remember all this stuff is flying at

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.430 
remember all this stuff is flying at
several<00:01:36.819> thousand<00:01:37.149> miles<00:01:37.240> an<00:01:37.450> hour<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:38.319> this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
several thousand miles an hour so this

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.900 
several thousand miles an hour so this
thing<00:01:38.649> fires<00:01:38.979> a<00:01:39.069> beam<00:01:39.310> of<00:01:39.490> light<00:01:39.520> at<00:01:39.819> the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
thing fires a beam of light at the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.639 
thing fires a beam of light at the
warhead<00:01:39.940> hits<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.840> fires<00:01:41.140> another<00:01:41.349> beam<00:01:41.619> of

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
warhead hits it fires another beam of

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.350 
warhead hits it fires another beam of
light<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.160> then<00:01:42.220> flies<00:01:42.670> out<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.119> way<00:01:43.209> it<00:01:43.330> came

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
light and then flies out the way it came

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.279 
light and then flies out the way it came
in<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:45.009> warhead<00:01:45.750> tumbles<00:01:46.750> out<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
in and the warhead tumbles out of the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:56.370 
in and the warhead tumbles out of the
hottest<00:01:47.500> bait

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.439
