00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.509
 no no 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.520
 hello very good guys and girls and the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 322 and well, today I bring a 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.720
 new video to the channel that was already a 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.099
 time without recording the minecraft not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.599
 had thought between something different and 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.099
 this time then look what I have 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.560
 thought of doing two little things for 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.480
 you're worth the first one is the map of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.500
 gta san andreas for more for the version 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.140
 of minecraft 1.8 and the second thing that had 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 thought it was to bring a text 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.699
 basically exculpate in hd is also worth 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 for version 1.8 if I'm going to put it right 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.250
 live teach a little 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.290
 or milk and milk is this now it seems 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.540
 look what I have as you can try 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.750
 above you will see that I have the main craft of 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.370
 mom theme in kraft 1.8 is it worth to me 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.430
 say that it is not crossing that yes that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm using voucher and look one I'm going to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 start with the map of cards before 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.990
 gta san andreas people have the pongo 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 nervous look how cool the truth that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.910
 is very very hung I was serving a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 little above and the truth that I had a 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.110
 level of detail that is really 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 incredible and how good is a map that the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 it's really good for the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.600
 people who have a 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.830
 a follower of minecraft since you can 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.870
 use for example for the games of 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.380
 hunger and things of these 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.000
 you will see that it is not a past technique and that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 good that surely he has put 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.210
 all these server users will 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 would come in handy and then look for another 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.350
 thing I wanted to talk about was the texture pack 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.520
 that one is in hd look at the forces 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.970
 show portal that you want it not me 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.160
 I remember badly of the 1.8 version 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.320
 see what you're seeing before and they're 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.210
 pistons 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.440
 see what a pimp we look like so perfect 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.390
 for a table and it's an enchanted pass 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.270
 also look at the soil floor this is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.380
 quartz block the fourth set you know 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.020
 what 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.220
 I think that for me, we are one 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.650
 of the best textual I've seen for 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.390
 for minecraft 1.8 and the truth is that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.310
 I thought about chicken because I do not wear it 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.010
 to the channel and well, here I am 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.840
 is your look I also believe that if not 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.819
 I remember badly is the yellow 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.660
 it is effectively in yellow and this 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.450
 it was stone stone like bone as you can 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.030
 check is such a text that really 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.420
 it is well notice this is also a 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.480
 technique passed here with the effect of 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.459
 curtain is very very good a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.069
 bookstore library also seem to me 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.299
 which are a pass with a street level 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.420
 what 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.660
 see how cool the bookstores are going to 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.510
 see here and there then also 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.730
 look here 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.730
 the jungle leaves set 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.370
 If I do not have a figure, it's really 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.430
 they are well made and they are very clear and 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.859
 that for the decoration theme are 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.170
 see how well I 've seen something else 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:13.540
 around here that were not jungle leaves but 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.080
 that they were normal leaves of jungle sorry 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.850
 and here is my nothing 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.850
 They are also very cool 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.160
 it's amazing how the trees are 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.030
 so they look real 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.950
 of all the notice how past these are 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.340
 oak leaves of all the life of the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.780
 Creepers also look at how I eat 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.420
 wool and well how to see how it looks like 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.040
 going up 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.810
 words that I already tell you that has 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.810
 I liked the theme of this 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 the lawn is also very well maintained 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.450
 and he is very cool 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.220
 and so also speaking through the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.990
 map because the truth is that I already say that 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.390
 is a map that is very very currado and 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.510
 that surely if you have a server 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.090
 minecraft where you have available the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.490
 game ahead because it's a map that I 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.030
 I think you will have to have yes or yes 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.610
 because this is a cordate in what is 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.580
 have stuck in doing this and it's a pass 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.620
 that is very very cool so what I said 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.959
 of I'm going to put both the text and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.940
 as the map in the description of this 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.550

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.720

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.210
