 in the module connects master good guys in that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.609
 world here we become leaders I 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.500
 I think it exists in this video already know 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.240
 and this video you tips for who 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.630
 is starting but can also be 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.690
 applied for who is already started is already 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 some time in good beauty mode 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.620
 The first tip I have for you is that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 They're starting, and you guys take a look. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.239
 in the cast that you have beauty or enter 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 in the management of the game plan time 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.039
 I 'm in control of the Bahia team, right? 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.660
 You can see that the team is the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.489
 cast that I already built 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 is not the base cast already comes from some 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.110
 players have already bought others and you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.149
 analyze your cast you have putting 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.550
 here are the best substitutes for 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.070
 example here I have a forwarder 70 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 it could be better that it 's here that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 75 Then do not put it there, I will. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.409
 changing or will making scheme that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.390
 very simple thing 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.210
 I think you should know this and I'm going 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.220
 putting the best that I find the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 better also depends on your 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.310
 style of play if you want a certain 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.259
 playing player you may be 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.900
 putting it clear that the team is to be you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.840
 It does what you want beauty good 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.450
 from this you will analyze which 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.729
 player is the worst of his cast is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 theoretically he has which has the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 worst score is here in mine and the worst 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 what score you have is this half 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.610
 that the 68 overall score that I go 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.250
 do then I'll go back here or 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 in case in business this advanced search 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 What do I have left? 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.220
 here I'll choose the position I 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.490
 I want 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.590
 look for the sock attachment in my case to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.670
 I'll be between 15 and 25 years old 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.469
 You can only beauty that these can 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 being equal in yours only to 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.680
 position that will be different 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.619
 the overall score will also be 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.390
 different from yours in my case is 68 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.800
 It's the least that has to be 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.550
 played a little bit more for this 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.260
 offsetting the transfer 70 the value 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.060
 market like discovering the value of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.900
 market that I should pay for right 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.190
 player 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.110
 I'll do the following I'll get the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.670
 my budget I have 47 million 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.340
 eight hundred and twenty -eight thousand and I'm going 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.709
 divide by 11 of that value 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.230
 I'm going to have more or less the value that I 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.330
 I have to pay is for each player 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.150
 so after you do that calculation is 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.010
 You 'll put your number here and it 's on. 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 Max for example I'll put here 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.110
 I did my calculation and gave what I got 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.709
 with whom to spend on what I can afford 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.239
 in case 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.870
 nine million nine hundred ninety nine 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.660
 thousand for each player so I put here 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.360
 999 million 999 thousand or in the case will be the 6 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.630
 million 999 thousand or I do not know if I was more 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.340
 rich 17 million practically then this 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.580
 goes from the pocket of each of the budget 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.850
 each one beautiful 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.790
 after that you will look you can see 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.920
 that he is already on this list and 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.230
 immense number of players and you will 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.170
 that you will look for the players that 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.420
 have the lowest availability ie 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.250
 players you can hire 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.190
 more easily 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.620
 First we go here to sort in the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.400
 overall falling score and looking for 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.470
 best 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.299
 How can you see if you have five? 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.400
 availability points , ie I do not 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.890
 I'll be able to hire them and they'll be 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.640
 Very difficult to hire, I'm going 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.680
 show an example 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.620
 an example is for you how to enter here 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.650
 in that half-attacker there beauty 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 you can see that it costs 9 million 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.769
 and 500 thousand 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.019
 speaking of him is only his annual salary 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.310
 two million and four hundred, but the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.070
 his availability 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.290
 to full or I can offer 14 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.390
 him and he will not accept a 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.720
 You can not hire now if you go from here. 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.160
 already has four available four 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.060
 points or is going to be a bit more 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.760
 easy to control 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.320
 but it's still hard then 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.500
 I advise you to hire 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.329
 players with three down 33 points 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.130
 availability for low beauty 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.260
 Well let's see some player here with 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.220
 Three down here today is a sock of 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.600
 connection with 3 down on 77 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.550
 Five good years let's see here 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.220
 well it only has three availability it has 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.350
 25 years 77 points in general we go 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.860
 always analyze the score with age 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.780
 huh 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.600
 the younger the age and the higher the score 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.080
 that is better and perhaps more expensive 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.310
 He is better, but it will be later. 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.870
 evolving and etc 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.390
 Good, I'm going to get in here today. 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 three I think we can hire right? 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.890
 a look at it costs 9 million the price 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.650
 of its annual salary is 2 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.790
 million and 300 thousand if it offers 10 million 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.290
 it's 900 thousand 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.020
 the level of satisfaction would already be 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.060
 or blue whiting is the goal is always 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.500
 reach the green face that is 100% 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.870
 chance you're hiring him 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.580
 Good, let's try to hire, here it is. 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.570
 in case like you would 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.430
 I put here would rather put here 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.100
 that for example to attack the green line 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.710
 Let's try to download, we have one. 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.270
 who pay less in the mouth here 9 million 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.750
 You can see the face is already left. 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.010
 different then we will go back here will go 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.960
 put 10 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.180
 then we will try to lower the house 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.430
 of the 1000 we can lower up more 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.169
 a little like this 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.910
 then this is basically our 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.540
 hiring here we would have to 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.630
 increase or even a further increase is 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.570
 Only here you can see that from the face 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.610
 green and yellow so basically the 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.740
 summary says are you choosing the 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.950
 price ratio, leaving the level of 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.990
 satisfaction between yellow and green beauty 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.400
 on top of these players it is clear that 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.950
 boj availability 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.410
 after that you'll review all your 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.479
 players buy all the best of 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.700
 according to its budget there is putting 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:10.050
 as of as headlines 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.090
 Are you going to do what you are going to? 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.680
 team and player information 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.750
 you will sell your players that 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.520
 Are not you using that you will not? 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.740
 use more in my case I already did it 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.320
 but for example how are you going to do this? 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.229
 You will put it here in the order you go. 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.750
 here in age and growing in my case 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.539
 has the player of 35 years but the score 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.490
 he is 74 or he is still being 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.639
 used, he's on my team. 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.219
 headlines 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.889
 I'm not going, I'm not going to sell, and if I had 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.319
 another player here older and with 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.449
 60 and a few general scoring I have with 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.379
 sure would already be putting him in 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.449
 negotiation 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:51.590
 another way is also you are seeing 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.779
 here in increasing general score you 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.090
 will see the players weaker in the case 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:59.330
 is that here is this connection that half 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.400
 66 but only that he is 22 years old 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.180
 I could was selling them or if I 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.560
 want to 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.479
 this is it depends a lot on the average 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.120
 if I re-pass in the other video 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.699
 your players are buying 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.469
 according to each position then if you

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:29.990

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:32.889
 importance to you beauty and then it is
