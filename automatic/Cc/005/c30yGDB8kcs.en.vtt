00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.489 
I'm just gonna first of all get myself a
signal<00:01:53.700> okay<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.899> gonna<00:01:54.990> strengthen

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
signal okay I'm just gonna strengthen

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:56.690 
signal okay I'm just gonna strengthen
that<00:01:55.590> signal<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> single<00:01:56.369> will<00:01:56.549> only

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that signal because a single will only

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.449 
that signal because a single will only
be<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.049> need<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.319> need<00:01:58.499> a<00:01:58.740> there

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
be one and then I need to need a there

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.809 
be one and then I need to need a there
we<00:01:59.520> go

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
we go

cliff so I'm going to just pop the chest

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.100 
cliff so I'm going to just pop the chest
over<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.090> I'm<00:02:18.240> going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> pop<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> command

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
over here I'm going to pop a command

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.920 
over here I'm going to pop a command
block<00:02:19.200> underneath<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.610> says<00:02:20.930> say

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
block it and I'm so I'm going to put

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.610 
block it and I'm so I'm going to put
down<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.150> block<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> can't<00:02:39.960> actually<00:02:40.110> open<00:02:40.260> it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
down a block so I can't actually open it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.520 
down a block so I can't actually open it
okay<00:02:41.460> I'm<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.600> give<00:02:42.960> myself<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.320> block

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
okay I'm going to give myself a block

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.930 
okay I'm going to give myself a block
over<00:02:43.800> there<00:02:43.830> give<00:02:44.160> myself<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.490> block<00:02:44.670> over

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
over there give myself a block over

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.910 
over there give myself a block over
there<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.110> get<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.440> sticky

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
there I'm going to go and get a sticky

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.460 
there I'm going to go and get a sticky
piston<00:02:47.270> like<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> don't<00:02:49.050> need<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> chest

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
piston like so I don't need a chest

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.030 
piston like so I don't need a chest
anymore

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
anymore

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.920 
anymore
okay<00:02:50.580> I'm<00:02:50.670> gonna<00:02:50.760> pop<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.270> sticky<00:02:51.510> piston<00:02:51.780> up

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
okay I'm gonna pop the sticky piston up

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.100 
okay I'm gonna pop the sticky piston up
there<00:02:52.140> okay<00:02:53.130> I'm<00:02:54.000> then<00:02:54.270> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.690> place

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
there okay I'm then going to place

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.350 
there okay I'm then going to place
another<00:02:55.320> block<00:02:55.680> there<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.220> gonna<00:02:56.360> bang

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
another block there and I'm gonna bang

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.920 
another block there and I'm gonna bang
OH

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
OH

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.680 
OH
delete<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.070> block<00:02:59.310> I'm<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.420> put<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
delete that block I'm going to put a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.170 
delete that block I'm going to put a
torch<00:03:01.020> over<00:03:01.170> there<00:03:01.470> which<00:03:01.650> then<00:03:01.800> activates<00:03:02.430> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
torch over there which then activates it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.310 
torch over there which then activates it
okay

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
okay

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.210 
okay
I'm<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.850> put<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.740> comparator<00:03:07.740> over<00:03:08.040> there

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
I'm going to put a comparator over there

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.780 
I'm going to put a comparator over there
and<00:03:09.230> I'm<00:03:10.230> then<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.980> put<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.310> command

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
and I'm then going to put a command

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.630 
and I'm then going to put a command
block<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.660> I'll<00:03:12.780> probably<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.140> need<00:03:13.410> to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
block so I'll probably just need to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.470 
block so I'll probably just need to
there<00:03:14.640> again<00:03:14.910> okay

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
there again okay

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.000 
there again okay
oh<00:03:15.510> come<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.810> block<00:03:15.990> now<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.740> I'm<00:03:16.830> going<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
oh come on block now what I'm going to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.540 
oh come on block now what I'm going to
do<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.250> I'm<00:03:17.400> gonna<00:03:17.520> go<00:03:17.730> test<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:19.020> at<00:03:19.950> player

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
do is I'm gonna go test for at player

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.620 
do is I'm gonna go test for at player
radius<00:03:23.550> equals<00:03:25.310> ten<00:03:26.340> okay<00:03:26.970> ten<00:03:27.300> from<00:03:27.480> this

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
radius equals ten okay ten from this

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.430 
radius equals ten okay ten from this
command<00:03:27.930> block<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.370> we're<00:03:29.910> gonna<00:03:30.000> say<00:03:30.440> score

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
command block and we're gonna say score

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.310 
command block and we're gonna say score
underscore<00:03:32.780> quest<00:03:34.730> quest

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
underscore quest quest

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.420 
underscore quest quest
underscore<00:03:37.320> minimum<00:03:37.890> equals<00:03:38.550> six<00:03:39.770> alright<00:03:40.770> so

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
underscore minimum equals six alright so

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.040 
underscore minimum equals six alright so
basically<00:03:41.550> what<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.150> command<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.780> going<00:03:42.959> to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
basically what this command is going to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.940 
basically what this command is going to
do<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.100> have<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.520> score<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.880> six<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:46.680> will

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
do is if I have a score of six it will

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.400 
do is if I have a score of six it will
then<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.610> will<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:48.420> activate<00:03:49.110> this

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
then it will then activate this

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.260 
then it will then activate this
comparator<00:03:50.010> okay

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
comparator okay

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.300 
comparator okay
