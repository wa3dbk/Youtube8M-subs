00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.210
 rt most innovative and welcome maria teresa with economy driver e 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.649
 management of the united companies falls serno line of salerno 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.089
 therefore data 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.450
 promo doctor 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.779
 you're lost privileged stereo observation point to badly the picture of 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.759
 what as the concept of innovation 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.039
 It was implemented in the countryside and in particular 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.359
 he goes to Salerno anyway in the province of Salerno 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.630
 farming briefly the to the scenario these innovations are in Campania 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.290
 the spice at which point it is 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.380
 so we first thank you and say that the mulinuccio in campania ie 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.790
 funds in mind 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.800
 I think from my point of view 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 that is that. say dealing with managerial economics 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.420
 noel innovation we analyze above all in terms of those 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.050
 which are the investments and therefore the impact above all 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.839
 financial toriko of investments in 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.219
 research and development must have within organizations 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.330
 business 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.440
 in particular then I think that 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.880
 if this is a sort of critical aspect that still if present in 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.590
 many of our organizations that is the fact of considering that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.300
 the innovation mail east 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.340
 accompanied and increasingly presented 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.409
 only and exclusively when there are loans that come from 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.170
 high 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.780
 and zero-cost investments from my point of view in organizations for 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.829
 being able to give that propulsive thrust now 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.000
 an increasingly international economy given must not exist can not 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.620
 persist but there must be 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.350
 a real intention of local companies to want to invest in their own 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 capital 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.830
 the fundamental interest of the put at least from the projects that I have had the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.509
 pleasure to analyze during this 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.249
 review and during the award was certainly that of the presence always 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:59.340
 more or less higher around 30% of equity capital than even companies 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.020
 locals 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.980
 have decided to devote literature to depressed innovation 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.340
 also scientific and tells her sky on TV that I am especially led in 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.989
 Anglo-Saxon studies 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.529
 prove it 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.959
 to invest in innovation 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.599
 and surrenders the most long-lived organizations therefore guarantees a sort of la 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.569
 reserve 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.040
 connected to the possibility of surviving better in the time for which it is 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.150
 certainly a lever from which you can not ignore and also the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.990
 Local business organizations are perhaps increasingly understanding it 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.460
 I repeat trying to allocate a share of the capital to say that 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.980
 they are the clash of road in from the interior 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.750
 from this point of view I went to this type of investment 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.599
 encouraging because for the company - which we have seen if 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.939
 this trend 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.299
 I repeat, it bodes well above all in terms of relaunching ours 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.859
 In any case, I believe that the economy is also influenced by ancestral elements today 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.629
 how to say to keep slower than most economies 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.999
 northern Italy, therefore, those of midday certainly stop 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.089
 however this is a given to my point of view that I found encouraging that 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.340
 it stimulated me even if I then allow myself to add 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.590
 I didn't even know how to say the premium ada will be encouraged 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.780
 companies to want to show themselves tell me I have done realized 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.629
 investments in innovation 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.599
 and therefore I want to present you my peculiarity my peculiarity e 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.629
 prerogative as queen of the south of the south 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.510
 this is a fact that I repeat struck us not just because not all of them 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.689
 how many companies had made this lara percentage of net capital 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.769
 respect 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.590
 to the investment even if at times rome think from funds but in any case for calls for tenders 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.889
 race that hour - take part in your results winners 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.919
 nn gave significant 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.609
 bimby from his words I deduce that the attitude of the entrepreneur from Campania 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.509
 in conclusion 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:04.159
 in the religion and positive there is this change and eats mind that there is this 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.769
 innovation that is 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.459
 menton of the animation approach to thinking a certain way 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.510
 yes it is certainly a new cultural tradition than in the summer 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.790
 I repeat from the projects that we have identified probably because yes 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.309
 however, it was also about best practice 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.419
 in my opinion there are still a lot of things to do and above all from 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.360
 raise awareness of the various business organizations in the area 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 who have to shake off this shape a little 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.039
 set back this setting a little more 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.810
 how to say rt auto of interistamai hope welfare 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.310
 in this sense I am 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.559
 the positive and I am optimistic and I think that 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:52.019
 ours is the capacity above all of what the meridian thought therefore 

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:56.759
 of our Mediterranean you have to make us look at ours too 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.130
 sense apparently of slowness 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.220
 as a prerogative it is like a fact to invest in 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.710
 for the future which can be a basis 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.350
 further innovation that is not always just technological cannot 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.150
 have and must have in my opinion 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.200
 very deep ballorian cultural bases linked to a strong rooting of the 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.340
 territory that our local businesses have decidedly decided if this defect 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.950
 I would drink only if there is no culture, there is no investment because I don't do it 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.400
 first talking to the interlocutor jeans 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.420
 yes indeed 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.759
 on this I say 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.810
 a phrase from di gandhi that said that no culture 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.780
 you can sister that claims to exclude the others then in the end surely 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.240
 the cultural aspect 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.830
 it is strong of the fundamental but there must be this openness therefore I invite 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.639
 companies, even at an opening both of a global character and of character 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.139
 international but just for comparison 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.910
 and therefore in a good dialectic that is ever stronger than it must exist with gods 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:54.740
 others 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.380
 Important Mediterranean sceneries will always make you more Mediterranean from my point 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.280
 of view 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.689
 but we also say not just really 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:04.900
 world 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.529
 kuduro dances 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.559
 it is on this maximum attachments 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:12.919
 let's ask him to condensate our chat in action 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.710
 doctor thank you for intervening here 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.789
 company 2 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.099
 rules and I give you appointment in a few minutes with the next protagonist 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:21.749
 of the day
