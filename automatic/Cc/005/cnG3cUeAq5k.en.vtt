like wonder if this is gonna be worth it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.849

I guess there's a little bit stressful

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.050 
I guess there's a little bit stressful
because<00:02:52.380> then<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.400> want<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.880> best

probably do you guys walk when you have

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.199 
probably do you guys walk when you have
no<00:02:57.989> pressure<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:58.880> they<00:02:59.880> don't<00:02:59.970> really

put pressure on you but you just put it
on<00:03:01.739> yourself<00:03:02.100> because<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:02.760> well
