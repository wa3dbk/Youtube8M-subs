all<00:00:10.620> right<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.880> original<00:00:12.300> motor

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
all right so this is the original motor

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.020 
all right so this is the original motor
out<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> s<00:00:13.049> 71<00:00:13.500> olds<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.730> cleaned

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
out of the s 71 olds and we just cleaned

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.300 
out of the s 71 olds and we just cleaned
it<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:16.139> not<00:00:16.350> aluminum<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.980> rattle

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
it up and it's not aluminum we rattle

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.550 
it up and it's not aluminum we rattle
candidate<00:00:17.699> silver<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.960> we've<00:00:19.230> been<00:00:19.350> kind<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
candidate silver but we've been kind of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.650 
candidate silver but we've been kind of
going<00:00:19.800> around<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.100> circles<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.910> how<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> do

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
going around in circles about how to do

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.320 
going around in circles about how to do
our<00:00:21.960> turbo<00:00:22.470> manifolds<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.240> an

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
our turbo manifolds because this is an

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.380 
our turbo manifolds because this is an
older<00:00:24.630> Bill<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.470> are<00:00:25.650> no<00:00:25.800> off-the-shelf

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
older Bill there are no off-the-shelf

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
older Bill there are no off-the-shelf
turbo<00:00:27.390> exhaust<00:00:27.960> manifolds<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.710> headers

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
turbo exhaust manifolds or headers

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.849 
turbo exhaust manifolds or headers
available<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.090> things<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.560> had<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
available for these things so we had the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.459 
available for these things so we had the
idea<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.790> look<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
idea if you look at this this is the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.580 
idea if you look at this this is the
factory<00:00:34.920> exhaust<00:00:35.040> manifold<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.380> right<00:00:37.380> down

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
factory exhaust manifold and right down

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.950 
factory exhaust manifold and right down
here<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> second<00:00:38.850> connection<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.719> what

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
here is a second connection and what

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889 
here is a second connection and what
this<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.250> cars<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.149> had<00:00:42.329> single

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this is for is the cars that had single

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.069 
this is for is the cars that had single
exhaust<00:00:43.850> there<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> pipe<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.539> connected

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
exhaust there was a pipe that connected

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750 
exhaust there was a pipe that connected
from<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> driver<00:00:47.010> side<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> passenger

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
from the driver side to the passenger

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
from the driver side to the passenger
side<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> single<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> way

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
side and then the single one all the way

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.660 
side and then the single one all the way
back<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:51.300> latest<00:00:52.010> go-around<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.430> try

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
back so our latest go-around is to try

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.959 
back so our latest go-around is to try
and<00:00:53.730> estimate<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.910> same

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and estimate if we can use that same

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
and estimate if we can use that same
style<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:58.260> run<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> pipe<00:00:58.710> underneath<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
style will run a pipe underneath to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
style will run a pipe underneath to
connect<00:00:59.730> back<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.930> run<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> down

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
connect back here and then run this down

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.939 
connect back here and then run this down
and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.640> it'll<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> loop<00:01:04.140> under<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> car

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and then it'll do a loop under the car

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
and then it'll do a loop under the car
and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.549> come<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:06.000> forward<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and then come back up forward to the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
and then come back up forward to the
turbo<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.490> won't<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
turbo and that way we won't have to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
turbo and that way we won't have to
worry<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.330> fabricating<00:01:10.260> custom<00:01:10.290> exhaust

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
worry about fabricating custom exhaust

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
worry about fabricating custom exhaust
manifolds<00:01:11.720> we<00:01:12.720> tried<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> trick<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.619> some

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
manifolds we tried the trick on some

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
manifolds we tried the trick on some
cars<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.659> reverse<00:01:15.960> them

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
cars you can take these and reverse them

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.390 
cars you can take these and reverse them
and<00:01:16.320> point<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.680> forward<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
and point them forward and then have the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
and point them forward and then have the
turbo<00:01:20.400> piping<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> front<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.320> our

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
turbo piping up on the front but in our

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.980 
turbo piping up on the front but in our
case<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> photographs<00:01:24.780> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
case you can see in the photographs we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.289 
case you can see in the photographs we
took<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.439> ends<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:25.860> hitting<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.460> motor<00:01:26.790> mounts

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
took it ends up hitting the motor mounts

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
took it ends up hitting the motor mounts
and<00:01:27.420> hitting<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> crossmember<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> getting

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and hitting the crossmember and getting

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.380 
and hitting the crossmember and getting
in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> belts<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.119> all<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
in the way of the belts and all that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.469 
in the way of the belts and all that
jazz<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.009> this<00:01:32.009> fit<00:01:32.280> factory<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.299> we're<00:01:33.420> just

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
jazz so this fit factory so we're just

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.789 
jazz so this fit factory so we're just
gonna<00:01:33.659> find<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:34.110> we're<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.740> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
gonna find out we're gonna put this in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
gonna find out we're gonna put this in
the<00:01:34.950> car<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> test<00:01:35.610> fit<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.540> if

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the car for a test fit and see if

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
the car for a test fit and see if
there's<00:01:36.780> enough<00:01:37.020> room<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.590> run<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> tube

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
there's enough room to run that tube

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
there's enough room to run that tube
under<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> car<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.750> back<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
under the car and then back up for the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
under the car and then back up for the
turbo<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.890> hopefully<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.670> should<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.000> nice<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
turbo so hopefully it should be nice and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
turbo so hopefully it should be nice and
easy<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:42.990> already<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.409> everything

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.230 

this<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.190> why<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:51.490> important<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:51.940> have<00:01:52.120> an

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
this is why it's important to have an

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.940 
this is why it's important to have an
engine<00:01:52.510> stand<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.930> has<00:01:53.050> casters<00:01:53.650> on<00:01:53.830> all

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
engine stand that has casters on all

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:05.130 
engine stand that has casters on all
four<00:01:54.220> sides

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.360 

well<00:02:06.140> we<00:02:06.230> put<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.500> motor<00:02:06.740> in<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.130> looking

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
well we put the motor in and looking

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.859 
well we put the motor in and looking
underneath<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.760> car<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.119> think<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.630> plans

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
underneath the car I think the plans

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.870 
underneath the car I think the plans
gonna<00:02:09.110> work<00:02:09.410> here's<00:02:10.009> our<00:02:10.310> driver's<00:02:10.850> side

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880

of<00:02:13.430> unique<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.030> Oldsmobile<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
of unique to this Oldsmobile is the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.160 
of unique to this Oldsmobile is the
factory<00:02:15.740> pan<00:02:16.040> has<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> cutout<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:17.090> where<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
factory pan has a cutout here where the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.650 
factory pan has a cutout here where the
original<00:02:18.410> cross<00:02:19.100> tube<00:02:19.430> would<00:02:19.580> go<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.540> we

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
original cross tube would go so if we

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.630 
original cross tube would go so if we
just<00:02:20.810> recreate<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.530> we<00:02:22.310> won't<00:02:22.460> have

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
just recreate that we won't have

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.460 
just recreate that we won't have
anything<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.150> hangs<00:02:23.330> below<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.810> pan<00:02:24.080> which

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
anything that hangs below the pan which

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.290 
anything that hangs below the pan which
we<00:02:24.590> perfect<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:25.820> it's<00:02:25.940> going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.150> zip

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
we perfect and then it's going to zip

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.110 
we perfect and then it's going to zip
right<00:02:26.510> up<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.810> here<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.340> then<00:02:28.340> they'll<00:02:28.910> both

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
right up to here and then they'll both

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.570 
right up to here and then they'll both
dump<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.900> guy<00:02:30.140> which<00:02:30.980> will<00:02:31.160> zip<00:02:31.370> down

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
dump out this guy which will zip down

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.050 
dump out this guy which will zip down
pull<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> quick<00:02:32.690> u-turn<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:34.130> go<00:02:34.190> right<00:02:34.640> back<00:02:34.670> up

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
pull a quick u-turn and go right back up

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.540 
pull a quick u-turn and go right back up
through<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.300> hole<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.930> feed<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.950> turbo<00:02:37.340> and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
through that hole and feed the turbo and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.330 
through that hole and feed the turbo and
then<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.750> turbo<00:02:39.140> exhaust<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.010> play<00:02:40.220> our

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
then the turbo exhaust if we play our

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.820 
then the turbo exhaust if we play our
cards<00:02:40.370> right<00:02:40.760> we'll<00:02:41.570> come<00:02:41.810> out<00:02:41.840> kind<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.680> on

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
cards right we'll come out kind of on

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.650 
cards right we'll come out kind of on
this<00:02:43.190> far<00:02:43.490> edge<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.810> spit<00:02:45.440> out<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:46.250> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
this far edge and then spit out here and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.110 
this far edge and then spit out here and
then<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:47.930> through<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.830> factory

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
then right through of the factory

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.570 
then right through of the factory
you<00:02:50.959> know<00:02:51.080> location<00:02:51.709> where<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> crossmember

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
you know location where the crossmember

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.280 
you know location where the crossmember
is<00:02:52.640> cut<00:02:52.790> out<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.570> should<00:02:53.750> be<00:02:53.780> pretty<00:02:53.959> slick

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
is cut out so it should be pretty slick

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.870 
is cut out so it should be pretty slick
and<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.709> looks<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.010> me<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:55.490> going<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.670> be

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
and it looks to me like it's going to be

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.420 
and it looks to me like it's going to be
you<00:02:56.570> know<00:02:56.660> about<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.080> easiest<00:02:57.530> way<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.920> add<00:02:58.400> a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
you know about the easiest way to add a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.940 
you know about the easiest way to add a
turbo<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.090> car<00:02:59.530> minimizing<00:03:00.530> crazy

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
turbo to this car minimizing crazy

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.949 
turbo to this car minimizing crazy
fabrication<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.209> other<00:03:02.330> fun<00:03:02.570> thing<00:03:02.600> is

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
fabrication and the other fun thing is

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.140 
fabrication and the other fun thing is
that<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.290> cast<00:03:03.530> iron<00:03:03.890> manifolds<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.910> last

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
that the cast iron manifolds the last

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.360 
that the cast iron manifolds the last
forever
