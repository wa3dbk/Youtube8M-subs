through a rhythm section fast I don't
explain<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.719> techniques<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:17.180> this<00:00:18.180> is

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
explain the techniques for that this is

explain the techniques for that this is
a<00:00:18.390> nice<00:00:18.630> easy<00:00:19.220> six<00:00:20.220> pack<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.640> call<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.970> rhythm

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
a nice easy six pack we call it rhythm

a nice easy six pack we call it rhythm
section<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.740> he's<00:00:22.859> coming<00:00:23.039> through

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
section and here he's coming through

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.580 
section and here he's coming through
fast<00:00:24.980> where<00:00:25.980> he<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:27.019> accelerating<00:00:28.019> through

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
fast where he is accelerating through

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
fast where he is accelerating through
the<00:00:28.740> spaces<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> jumps<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.689> then

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the spaces of the jumps and then

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.620 
the spaces of the jumps and then
absorbing<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.740> off<00:00:32.239> here<00:00:33.239> you'll<00:00:33.420> see

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
absorbing the take off here you'll see

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.880 
absorbing the take off here you'll see
it<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.079> bit<00:00:34.290> better<00:00:36.710> acceleration<00:00:37.710> all

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it a little bit better acceleration all

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
it a little bit better acceleration all
the<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.100> through<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.879> between<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.480> jump<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the way through in between the jump and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.520 
the way through in between the jump and
then<00:00:40.530> absorbing<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> take<00:00:41.640> off<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:43.230> notice

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
then absorbing the take off you notice

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.610 
then absorbing the take off you notice
the<00:00:43.710> acceleration<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:45.840> he<00:00:45.930> continues

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the acceleration and then he continues

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.459 
the acceleration and then he continues
to<00:00:46.800> accelerate<00:00:47.390> between<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> jumps<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.350> he

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
to accelerate between the jumps then he

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.970 
to accelerate between the jumps then he
backs<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> throttle<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.840> absorbs<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
backs off the throttle and absorbs the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
backs off the throttle and absorbs the
take<00:00:53.250> off<00:00:53.489> part<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> jump<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.629> there

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
take off part of the jump right there

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.770 
take off part of the jump right there
you<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.199> him<00:00:55.320> absorbing<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
you see him absorbing to take off and

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.580 
you see him absorbing to take off and
off<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> throttle<00:00:58.289> carry<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.129> lot<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.579> speed

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
off the throttle carry a lot more speed

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
off the throttle carry a lot more speed
the<00:01:01.940> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> beginner<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the kind of beginner way of doing that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.100 
the kind of beginner way of doing that
is<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> accelerate<00:01:06.420> hard<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
is not to accelerate hard through the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
is not to accelerate hard through the
top<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.970> then<00:01:09.650> accelerate<00:01:10.650> through<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.189> joke

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
top and then accelerate through the joke

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.340 
top and then accelerate through the joke
so<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> gas<00:01:12.869> through<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so you're on the gas through the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
so you're on the gas through the
take-off<00:01:13.799> part<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.220> joke<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
take-off part of the joke or you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.109 
take-off part of the joke or you can
lose<00:01:15.390> speed<00:01:15.689> between<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.530> jumps<00:01:16.979> doing<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
lose speed between the jumps doing that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
lose speed between the jumps doing that
because<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.020> accelerating<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.860> fast

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because you're not accelerating so fast

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.270 
because you're not accelerating so fast
and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.090> also<00:01:21.240> lose<00:01:21.920> time<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and then you can also lose time in the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.410 
and then you can also lose time in the
air<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.729> you're<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.150> higher

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
air because you're going to go higher

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.280 
air because you're going to go higher
and<00:01:24.689> further<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.710> landing<00:01:26.430> here

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
and further you see landing here

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.319 
and further you see landing here
accelerating<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> little<00:01:28.590> bit<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> through

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
accelerating a little bit but through

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
accelerating a little bit but through
this<00:01:30.540> part<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> jump<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> middle<00:01:31.799> not

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this part of the jump in the middle not

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.510 
this part of the jump in the middle not
accelerating<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.659> he<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.079> accelerate<00:01:34.650> when

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
accelerating so he can accelerate when

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
accelerating so he can accelerate when
he<00:01:35.610> goes<00:01:35.820> through<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.570> jump<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
he goes through the jump for the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
he goes through the jump for the
compression<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.920> rebound<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:41.070> course

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
compression and rebound and of course

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.149 
compression and rebound and of course
you<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.549> higher<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.780> further<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.979> way<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you go higher and further so the way to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.120 
you go higher and further so the way to
do<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.450> carry<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:45.960> speed<00:01:46.140> between<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
do it is to carry your speed between the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.420 
do it is to carry your speed between the
jumps

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
jumps

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.610 
jumps
and<00:01:48.520> then<00:01:49.060> back<00:01:49.390> off<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.840> throttle<00:01:49.870> and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
and then back off the throttle and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.660 
and then back off the throttle and
absorb<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.520> take<00:01:51.730> off<00:01:51.970> part<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.420> job
