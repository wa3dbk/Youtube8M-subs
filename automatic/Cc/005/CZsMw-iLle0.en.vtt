00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:20.060
 Do you have anything to wash your hair all over 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.060
 Shampoo deep cleansing shampoo bottles 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.570
 Shampoo rinsing moisture 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.420
 Wonderful I find it terrific easy 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.800
 just a shampoo for my hair too 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410
 use and they will be soft 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 supple and well maintained but quite so 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.800
 it's just easy with long ones 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.510
 then hair is not yet 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.980
 my main routine is relative 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 minimalist and I'll show you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.940
 today before we come to the products 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 two more words to my hair 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.809
 I have hair streaked so I have 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.340
 highlights in the hair are why 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.079
 Of course, my hair is much more 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.879
 attacked as hair on the one 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 are natural and not colored 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.329
 or stretched 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.489
 and i have hair as well as long 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.560
 I would say around medium-long hair 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020
 a hair structure is actually because 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.439
 I frieze with everyone a bit 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 case 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.580
 they just look like that because I am 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.900
 getting the ferritin treatment brazil 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.729
 make blowout I already have that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.170
 made three videos I link you 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.030
 everyone in the infobox there you can 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.560
 like to have a look and that's why 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.420
 I always have this result in mine 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.890
 hair and that's why I need it too 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.950
 not too many products and also 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.420
 no super expensive special products because 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 Simply this charity in treatment 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 already the best of my hair 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.640
 get out and they just 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 makes it supple and silky and beautiful 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960
 smooth and therefore enough for me 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 These simple products do this in the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.810
 I also give drogerie a lot 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.070
 very good 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 you will soon see that in mine 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 whole care products no silicones 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.140
 that's just because of that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.210
 I realized that my hair was very 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.009
 are much nicer without silicones 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.659
 because they always clapped like that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.430
 were complaining and that happened 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.960
 me with the product and not now 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.520
 Let's get to the products that I have 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 I use under the shower and I have 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 two series i love everything about you 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.799
 I always use one of them 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.229
 santhera a series and indeed the whole 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.509
 album with organic orange and the whole 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.159
 Hair conditioner both are very sorry 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.739
 the products the shampoo makes the hair 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.689
 very clean without drying out 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.819
 They are very nice and handy 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.980
 they are not somehow strawy 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.689
 and this flushing complains the hair 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.340
 not at all that's it anyway 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.079
 The rinse makes the hair very silky 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.790
 and makes it smooth and I appreciate it that way 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.989
 on the products and these are mine 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.459
 I always do that 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.260
 Used when I wash my hair 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.569
 and when i say you i need 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 a little more care just when I am 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.659
 maybe that time carradine 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.609
 Treatment is not in there then 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.189
 i like to use the products of 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.019
 Altera that consists of a whole series 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.209
 Three products are available from Rossmann 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.639
 namely the moisture series once 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.319
 the shampoo the conditioner and the hair cure 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.629
 especially the hako i can totally give you 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.209
 to heart a very rich 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.400
 Haarkur is that really the hair 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.530
 so supple makes us so close 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.379
 and that's just my wonder weapon 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.209
 if you hair very porous sense or very 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.040
 peacefully then I always use the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.810
 hair contrasts properly long in it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.489
 Shampoo is also very caring 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.810
 especially for people with very dry ones 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.329
 I can totally shampoo the hair 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.910
 recommend is a beautiful nice 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.230
 moisture bomb quasi I use 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.209
 also very happy on vacation if mine 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.579
 Hair leached by sea and sun 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.010
 are used as a particularly intensive hq 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.109
 I really like coconut oil from the organic store 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.430
 how I exactly when the how long 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.620
 I let in and the before afterwards 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.299
 Effect will be cinema 10 I plan to do so 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.799
 completely own video 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.870
 Sometimes it happens that I get out of the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.010
 shower come my hair totally matted 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.239
 especially when I go to 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.459
 For example , just a shampoo user 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.410
 because I have no time and then love 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.940
 I sprayed the gliss kur 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.949
 there are quite different I think 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.209
 the all terrific man sprays himself 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.680
 In the hair you can see them immediately 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.780
 comb through well 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.910
 They are silicone bombs but I give that 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 only my lengths and not in the approach 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.239
 he's totally in it for me 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.280
 order and I prefer to use something with 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.260
 silicone from time to time than that me 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.909
 when combing out the hair rip 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.620
 If I like my cycle a bit 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.419
 I would like to delay then I use 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.849
 I like to dry my favorite 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.349
 alge marina does not care if that is 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.940
 orange or the purple does not find the 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.069
 both are very good at rossmann 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.269
 at mÃ¼ller and what i like about it so much 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.489
 I like that the fragrance really is 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.079
 bearable is that not at all 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.690
 sticks in the hair but is power 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.370
 the hair 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.900
 the beautiful fluffy and that's why 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.910
 My darling when I have my hair 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.530
 so to speak natural so wear 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.240
 really like they are a bit like that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.880
 because I like to use it then 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 hokusai wax from swiss grandpa kneading 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.000
 I hold it in my hair 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.620
 the lure or choose much better 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.660
 I can totally recommend that, too 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.670
 then curl her with the curling iron 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.320
 is that a super middle thing I always did 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.640
 use is a volume I have is pure 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.710
 that here of valea I do not think so 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.570
 so good but I only have that here 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.120
 I really like the contact very much 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.740
 happy but otherwise volume brother 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.600
 I think it's awesome because if the hair so 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.550
 you are liquid you want to put it up 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.230
 or like today but braided hairstyle 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.850
 then it's great if you do 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.290
 before volume brother in the year then gives 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.510
 have that grip and you can 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.880
 Much much better to work with 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.590
 updos braids pigtails 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.780
 and so on, try it 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.920
 from when you had very fine hair and 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.150
 The last one is a thing that I 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.100
 actually always there is easy 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.810
 hair spray no matter which I am there 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.460
 not demanding at all 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.020
 I always take such a small size 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.850
 with us and I all work completely 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.080
 well I do not use it all the time 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.120
 I can not recommend you also 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.919
 hair spray will dry out your hair so 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.450
 he uses as little as possible 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.040
 behind the care products I give you 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.660
 now shown in this video stand 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.460
 I really fully use it 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.320
 I have been consistently for two years now 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.030
 keep buying it after I try 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.500
 rarely something new and I always come 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.630
 back to the back because of the 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.130
 really good and recommendable 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.810
 otherwise I can recommend you 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.510
 if you have problems with volunteers 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.550
 stubborn hair or broken cock then 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.020
 as little heat applied there times 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.550
 I have the biggest difference with me 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.380
 I realized I had my hair 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.970
 almost never now with that 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.100
 charity in treatment even more me 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.570
 but also not before that and I feel it 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.130
 really only when they are almost 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.140
 are still dry around my form 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.970
 to get in and otherwise completely 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.500
 simply not and thank you 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.910
 you have so much hair 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.250
 I like to write in the comments 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.140
 how you wear your hair and on what you do 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.400
 especially disturbing and then I am happy 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.660
 very much next time 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.660
 See again here on my canal
