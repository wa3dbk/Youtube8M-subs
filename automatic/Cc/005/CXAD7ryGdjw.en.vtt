00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
more value for a variety of reasons it's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
more value for a variety of reasons it's
easier<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> pump<00:01:01.500> money<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> pot<00:01:02.100> when

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we have the best of it it's easier to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.149 
we have the best of it it's easier to
apply<00:01:04.290> pressure<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.890> feel<00:01:05.070> like

apply pressure when we feel like
bluffing<00:01:05.489> away<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.330> easier<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> control<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
easier as well what this means is that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.480 
easier as well what this means is that
we<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> play<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> wider<00:01:13.830> range<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> hands<00:01:14.340> in
