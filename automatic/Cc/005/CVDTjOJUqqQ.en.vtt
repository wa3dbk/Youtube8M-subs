having<00:00:05.160> studied<00:00:05.430> whales<00:00:05.850> here<00:00:06.300> in<00:00:06.569> Galapagos

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:07.229 
having studied whales here in Galapagos

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.280 
having studied whales here in Galapagos
for<00:00:07.500> many<00:00:07.740> many<00:00:07.950> years<00:00:08.100> I<00:00:08.700> can<00:00:09.180> say<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
for many many years I can say that the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.959 
for many many years I can say that the
learning<00:00:10.770> process<00:00:10.950> for<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.940> human<00:00:12.300> being<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
learning process for the human being is

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.080 
learning process for the human being is
far<00:00:14.969> greater<00:00:15.410> by<00:00:16.410> studying<00:00:16.860> whales<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.820> their

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
far greater by studying whales in their

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.740 
far greater by studying whales in their
natural<00:00:18.330> habitat<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.820> their<00:00:21.029> natural<00:00:21.210> way

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
natural habitat and in their natural way

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.609 
natural habitat and in their natural way
to<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:22.820> without<00:00:23.820> rushing<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.810> amongst<00:00:25.380> them

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to be without rushing in amongst them

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.330 
to be without rushing in amongst them
and<00:00:25.770> trying<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.550> select<00:00:26.880> whales<00:00:27.270> to<00:00:27.689> kill

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
and trying to select whales to kill

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.130 
and trying to select whales to kill
therefore<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> point<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.660> view<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
therefore from a point of view of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
therefore from a point of view of
studying<00:00:32.270> whales<00:00:33.440> we<00:00:34.440> believe<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.520> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
studying whales we believe that it is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.320 
studying whales we believe that it is
simply<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.450> necessary<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.500> kill<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
simply not necessary to kill them and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.040 
simply not necessary to kill them and
this<00:00:39.330> brings<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.260> question<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
this brings up the question of

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.900 
this brings up the question of
