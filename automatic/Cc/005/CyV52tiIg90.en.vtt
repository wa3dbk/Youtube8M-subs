00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello today I will teach you to do 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.300
 do-it-yourself cat collar 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.660
 the conditions for this I took my old 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.660
 lime 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:29.029
 measured the length of my neck my cats afterwards 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.029
 took and folded two inside so 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:44.660
 that is, so make two pieces and already 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.710
 bottom outside and inside many times 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.079
 stapler made into this and here and then 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.140
 pasted such beads in order 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.520
 glue moment and then gave the collar 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.520
 dry that's what I did 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:06.090
 I think this collar 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.689
 very nice fit my cats but 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 before when you all finished right away 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.840
 say let the collar dry a little 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.790
 as the beads can just peel off 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.790
 since this is a very smooth side 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 basically it was all beads possible 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 any use also you can 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:38.250
 use all sorts of different and other 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.409
 beads 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.229
 but in no case let the cats 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.360
 play set perfect like beads 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:56.430
 can peel off 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:03.140
 and you can also fall and I forgot how 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.140
 called up spikes put in your collar 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.020
 it is very original to be here with you 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.550
 was Victoria rocker put your finger 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 up and subscribe to my channel 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.690
 i don't really like a different color but so 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.360
 how was my pink belt 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:38.660
 when came out so well let's try 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:38.660
 put it on the cat in principle if where 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:50.100
 I 'll close the stones a little 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.940
 painfully put on a cat practically 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.010
 does not dress 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.489
 nothing picture now liza oregano this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.560
 they she has space there in 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.470
 Basically, such a ball went down and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:15.390
 it seems he looks gorgeous now 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:20.310
 so thin shoots let you so 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:24.060
 everything is dry and then you never know what principle 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.390
 probably you probably 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.440
 It turns out as I have given 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.440
 bye for now
