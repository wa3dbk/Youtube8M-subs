00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 hello today we're going 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680
 learn the introduction of the piece 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.509
 the assault of the phoenix group 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 we can divide this introduction into 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.500
 two parts a first only 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.030
 play on the tomes and the hihat and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.160
 a second one where we will 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.530
 the bass drum and the snare drum 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.030
 for the first part we will play in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 loop three strikes on the right hand 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.010
 a first on the viola volume a 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.030
 second on the low volume and finally a 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 last on the charleston 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.200
 we could try to put a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.269
 pulsation every three keystrokes like 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.620
 this 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 but in fact if 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.610
 we listen to the rest of the song we go 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.250
 account that there is rather a pulsation 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.940
 both keystrokes as entered 1 2 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.220
 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and the other particularity 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.290
 it is that the first strikes on the volume 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.330
 viola we will not put it at the beginning of 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.910
 measures but on the contrary we're going to 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.080
 put at the very end of a measurement 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.440
 what does that give to 60 beats by 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.440
 minute 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.259
 the second part we will watch 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.420
 exactly the same game in the right hand 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.009
 but we will add the bigger ones 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.659
 crates and left hand 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.670
 we will add crates and 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.860
 charleston so that's what it gives 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.960
 just for the bass drum 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.009
 clear and hi-hat to the left hand to 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.009
 60 beats per minute 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.420
 now it remains more than assembling 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.130
 the rhythm then in a first 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.450
 time to simplify I advise you 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.220
 to play only snare drums 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.510
 in the left hand and in a second 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.440
 time you can add the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.270
 hi-hat left hand 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.690
 that's what gives it to 60 beats 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.690
 per minute 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.450
 now you have more than 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.099
 assemble the first rhythm that you 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.170
 have seen in the beginning only about the rates 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.120
 but the hihat and the second beat 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.530
 that you just saw at the moment I 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.090
 recommend you to work it very 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.900
 slowly at the beginning and speed up 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.569
 gradually 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.069
 that's what gives it to 151 beats 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.340
 per minute that is the actual speed of the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.340
 piece 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.170
 Well, that's all for today 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.430
 I am waiting for your comments and I will 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.849
 say very soon on beating in 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.849
