Hyundai<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.550> would<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.879> believe<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Hyundai so would you believe that the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.609 
Hyundai so would you believe that the
older<00:00:54.899> Hyundai<00:00:56.030> uses<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.699> older<00:01:03.000> Hyundai

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
older Hyundai uses the older Hyundai

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.910 
older Hyundai uses the older Hyundai
uses<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> ball<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> socket<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.210> spring

just<00:01:49.979> found<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.460> unscrew<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> after

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
just found it to go unscrew it and after

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
just found it to go unscrew it and after
I<00:01:51.360> ground<00:01:51.750> off

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I ground off

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.670 
I ground off
hey<00:01:53.300> long<00:01:54.300> story<00:01:54.690> short<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.230> ball-and-socket

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
hey long story short the ball-and-socket

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.310 
hey long story short the ball-and-socket
wouldn't<00:01:56.100> work<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.720> welded<00:01:57.720> my<00:01:57.870> original

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
wouldn't work so I welded my original

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130 
wouldn't work so I welded my original
mounts<00:01:58.680> onto<00:01:59.250> the<00:02:00.030> new<00:02:00.210> struts<00:02:00.660> right<00:02:00.960> onto

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
mounts onto the new struts right onto

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.220 
mounts onto the new struts right onto
the<00:02:01.260> threads<00:02:01.620> that<00:02:01.770> held<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.220> little<00:02:02.430> brass

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
the threads that held that little brass

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.040 
the threads that held that little brass
nut<00:02:04.230> whatever<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> brass<00:02:04.980> nut<00:02:05.960> normally<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
nut whatever that brass nut normally you

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.420 
nut whatever that brass nut normally you
can't<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.620> nut<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.160> inside<00:02:09.050> Barry

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
can't see that nut it's inside Barry

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.450 
can't see that nut it's inside Barry
actually<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.820> just<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.170> fraction<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.460> so

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
actually see it just a fraction of it so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.790 
actually see it just a fraction of it so
I<00:02:14.700> modified<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.600> new<00:02:15.780> struts<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.320> fit<00:02:16.650> these

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
I modified the new struts to fit these

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.280 
I modified the new struts to fit these
old<00:02:17.040> brackets<00:02:17.550> when<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> buy<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.140> struts<00:02:19.140> for

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
old brackets when you buy the struts for

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.750 
old brackets when you buy the struts for
correct<00:02:19.740> ones<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.160> comes<00:02:20.340> with<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.550> bracket

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
correct ones it comes with a bracket

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.480 
correct ones it comes with a bracket
built<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.510> yeah<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.750> riveted<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.490> round

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
built in so yeah it's riveted on round

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.680 
built in so yeah it's riveted on round
that<00:02:23.640> rivet<00:02:23.820> off<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.210> that's<00:02:24.300> not<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.570> way<00:02:24.660> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that rivet off but that's not the way to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.240 
that rivet off but that's not the way to
do<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.990> way<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:28.160> you're<00:02:29.160> gonna

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
do with the way to do this you're gonna

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.850 
do with the way to do this you're gonna
weld<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> onto<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> new<00:02:30.150> strut<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:31.560> hard<00:02:31.770> to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
weld it onto the new strut it's hard to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.260 
weld it onto the new strut it's hard to
do<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.220> gotta<00:02:32.430> clamp<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.000> fresh

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
do because you gotta clamp it on fresh

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.640 
do because you gotta clamp it on fresh
metal<00:02:33.540> there's<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> lot<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.260> rooms<00:02:34.470> a

little little plastic bushing there and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.760 
little little plastic bushing there and
you<00:02:36.360> can't<00:02:36.600> melt<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> little<00:02:36.959> plastic<00:02:37.230> bushings

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
you can't melt a little plastic bushings

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.890 
you can't melt a little plastic bushings

step bumper style trailer hitch on my
stuff<00:02:52.709> bourbon<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:55.010> how<00:02:56.010> I'm<00:02:56.160> gonna<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.550> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
stuff bourbon and how I'm gonna do that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.729 
stuff bourbon and how I'm gonna do that
is<00:02:57.120> very<00:02:57.870> interesting<00:02:58.560> so<00:03:00.170> problem<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
is very interesting so problem is the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.759 
is very interesting so problem is the
old<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.190> mounted<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> side<00:03:03.320> one<00:03:04.320> bolt

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
old one mounted on the side one bolt

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.310 
old one mounted on the side one bolt
pivoted<00:03:05.340> there<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.760> had<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> couple<00:03:06.120> bolts<00:03:06.420> one

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
pivoted there and had a couple bolts one

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.650 
pivoted there and had a couple bolts one
there<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.620> one<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.600> on<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
there and one there and one here on a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.040 
there and one there and one here on a
strap<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.250> old<00:03:11.370> hitch<00:03:11.610> they're

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
strap there's the old hitch they're

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.990 
strap there's the old hitch they're
entirely<00:03:13.050> different<00:03:13.200> systems<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:14.970> I

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
entirely different systems on this one I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.430 
entirely different systems on this one I
prefer<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.480> one<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.720> has<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:15.989> step

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
prefer this one it has a little step

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.840 
prefer this one it has a little step
built<00:03:16.769> into<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.280> course<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.610> have<00:03:17.820> a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
built into it but of course now I have a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.360 
built into it but of course now I have a
step<00:03:18.120> bumpers<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.510> don't<00:03:18.720> need<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.620> got

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
step bumpers I don't need this but I got

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.699 
step bumpers I don't need this but I got
it<00:03:20.489> all<00:03:20.580> painted<00:03:20.910> up<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.290> can't<00:03:22.500> put<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
it all painted up and you can't put the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.110 
it all painted up and you can't put the
step<00:03:22.920> bumper<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.370> because<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.640> step<00:03:23.820> bumper

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
step bumper on because the step bumper

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.630 
step bumper on because the step bumper
attaches<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.720> side<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.680> does<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.459> old

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
attaches to the side and so does the old

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.040 
attaches to the side and so does the old
hitch<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.239> hitch<00:03:27.420> attaches<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
hitch so this hitch attaches to the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.840 
hitch so this hitch attaches to the
bottom<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.860> there's<00:03:29.040> one<00:03:29.250> hole<00:03:29.459> right<00:03:29.610> there

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
bottom so there's one hole right there

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.750 
bottom so there's one hole right there
but<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> other<00:03:30.989> hole<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:31.530> here<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.640> you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
but the other hole is right here and you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.400 
but the other hole is right here and you
can't<00:03:33.000> get<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> gas<00:03:33.989> tank<00:03:34.290> is

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
can't get to it because the gas tank is
