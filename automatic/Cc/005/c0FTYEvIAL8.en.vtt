00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
see this launch really sprucing up

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.410 
see this launch really sprucing up
getting<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> amorites<00:00:38.640> share<00:00:38.879> back<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
getting the amorites share back in the

getting the amorites share back in the
compact<00:00:39.750> single<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.160> quite

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
compact single well I I think it's quite

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.010

a<00:00:41.370> significant<00:00:41.940> launcher<00:00:42.360> yes<00:00:42.570> three<00:00:42.780> point

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a significant launcher yes three point

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
a significant launcher yes three point
nine<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> good<00:00:43.860> aggressive<00:00:44.100> price<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
nine is a good aggressive price but I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.180 
nine is a good aggressive price but I
think<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> talking<00:00:45.420> point<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think the talking point is that the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910 
think the talking point is that the
automatic<00:00:47.789> version<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:48.570> comes<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.289> four

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
automatic version which comes at four

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
automatic version which comes at four
point<00:00:50.160> three<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.440> very

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
point three and that really is a very

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
point three and that really is a very
exciting<00:00:53.280> price<00:00:53.489> they're<00:00:53.730> giving<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
exciting price they're giving the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
exciting price they're giving the
automatic<00:00:54.570> even<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> base<00:00:55.379> version<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
automatic even from the base version so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
automatic even from the base version so
clearly<00:00:56.579> Maruti<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.300> intent<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> really

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
clearly Maruti is intent is to really

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.069 
clearly Maruti is intent is to really
have<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.250> mover<00:00:59.579> advantage<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.870> mass

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
have first mover advantage in the mass

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
have first mover advantage in the mass
segment<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.739> automatic<00:01:02.039> transmission<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
segment with automatic transmission and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
segment with automatic transmission and
this<00:01:03.000> AMT<00:01:03.480> gearbox<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.680> quite

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this AMT gearbox is actually quite

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
this AMT gearbox is actually quite
suitable<00:01:05.360> because<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.659> doesn't<00:01:06.990> compromise

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
suitable because it doesn't compromise

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
suitable because it doesn't compromise
fuel<00:01:07.439> efficiency<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
fuel efficiency which is one of the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
fuel efficiency which is one of the
issues<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.689> they're<00:01:10.350> trying

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
issues so I think really they're trying

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560 
issues so I think really they're trying
to<00:01:10.560> differentiate<00:01:11.010> themselves<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to differentiate themselves now with the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
to differentiate themselves now with the
AMT<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> scenario<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
AMT and I think the scenario is going to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
AMT and I think the scenario is going to
be<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> first<00:01:14.729> product<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.689> long<00:01:15.869> list<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
be the first product in a long list of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.359 
be the first product in a long list of
products<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.159> gearbox

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
products I got to get this gearbox

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
products I got to get this gearbox
that's<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> spoke<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.420> American<00:01:18.689> he

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
was referring to how they will also want
to<00:01:21.509> replicate<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.110> same<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.159> other

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to replicate the same in their other

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
to replicate the same in their other
models<00:01:23.820> too<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> know<00:01:24.600> coming<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
models too but you know coming to the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.609 
models too but you know coming to the
Celerio<00:01:26.070> specific<00:01:27.110> automatic<00:01:28.110> manual

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
Celerio specific automatic manual

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.580 
Celerio specific automatic manual
auto<00:01:30.310> gearshift<00:01:30.969> really<00:01:31.329> it<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.409> something

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
auto gearshift really it is something

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.440 
auto gearshift really it is something
that<00:01:32.829> other<00:01:33.189> car<00:01:33.430> manufactures<00:01:33.939> will<00:01:34.060> also

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
that other car manufactures will also

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.389 
that other car manufactures will also
follow<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.380> think<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:35.829> I<00:01:35.860> think<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.219> definitely

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
follow I think so I think I definitely

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.160 
follow I think so I think I definitely
you<00:01:36.729> know<00:01:36.820> go<00:01:36.969> to<00:01:37.000> understand<00:01:37.630> that's<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:38.020> very

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
you know go to understand that's a very

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.020 
you know go to understand that's a very
basic<00:01:38.439> transmission<00:01:38.950> quite<00:01:39.490> frankly<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:39.939> a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
basic transmission quite frankly is a

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.029 
basic transmission quite frankly is a
transmission<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.840> you've<00:01:41.380> been<00:01:41.500> passed<00:01:41.770> on

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
transmission that you've been passed on

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.950 
transmission that you've been passed on
in<00:01:42.220> markets<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.240> Europe<00:01:43.270> which<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.840> now

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
in markets like Europe which have now

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.719 
in markets like Europe which have now
more<00:01:44.140> sophisticated<00:01:44.799> transmissions<00:01:45.520> like

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
more sophisticated transmissions like

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.639 
more sophisticated transmissions like
dual<00:01:46.299> clutch<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.780> even<00:01:46.929> our<00:01:47.020> talk<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.229> what<00:01:47.500> is

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
dual clutch and even our talk on what is

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.279 
dual clutch and even our talk on what is
doing<00:01:47.890> well<00:01:48.039> but<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.579> think<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.079> this

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
doing well but I think you know this

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.740 
doing well but I think you know this
this<00:01:50.890> technology<00:01:51.579> is<00:01:51.850> really<00:01:51.880> very<00:01:52.299> relevant

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
this technology is really very relevant

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.630 
this technology is really very relevant
for<00:01:52.960> India<00:01:53.350> there<00:01:53.799> are<00:01:53.950> issues<00:01:54.340> there's<00:01:54.579> a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
for India there are issues there's a

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.639 
for India there are issues there's a
little<00:01:54.819> bit<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:55.000> jerkiness<00:01:55.420> or<00:01:55.960> head<00:01:56.229> not<00:01:56.439> what

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
little bit of jerkiness or head not what

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.870 
little bit of jerkiness or head not what
they<00:01:56.770> call<00:01:56.799> when<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.250> drive<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.670> which

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
they call when you drive it which

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.690 
they call when you drive it which
consumers<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:59.350> know<00:01:59.409> can<00:01:59.679> feel<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.429> I<00:02:00.460> think

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
consumers you know can feel but I think

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.460 
consumers you know can feel but I think
what<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.299> think<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:01.959> gonna<00:02:02.200> cause<00:02:02.439> a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
what I think is this is gonna cause a

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.100 
what I think is this is gonna cause a
resurgence<00:02:03.159> in<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.399> AMT<00:02:03.849> technology<00:02:04.599> and<00:02:04.869> I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
resurgence in the AMT technology and I

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.270 
resurgence in the AMT technology and I
think<00:02:05.140> manufactures<00:02:05.799> going<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.039> further

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
think manufactures going to further

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.460 
think manufactures going to further
refine<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.090> smoothing<00:02:07.899> out<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.080> power

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
refine and smoothing out the power

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.800 
refine and smoothing out the power
delivery<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.819> definitely<00:02:10.599> going<00:02:10.750> to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
delivery of this and definitely going to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.960 
delivery of this and definitely going to
see<00:02:10.959> even<00:02:11.170> more<00:02:11.459> companies<00:02:12.459> come<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:12.700> with

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
but the real innovation here is the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.589 
but the real innovation here is the
automated<00:03:21.190> manual<00:03:21.549> transmission<00:03:21.670> called

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
automated manual transmission called

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.849 
automated manual transmission called
easy<00:03:22.930> drive<00:03:24.930> though<00:03:25.930> practically<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.650> works

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
easy drive though practically it works

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.770 
easy drive though practically it works
like<00:03:27.069> any<00:03:27.099> other<00:03:27.400> Auto<00:03:27.700> would<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.329> different

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
like any other Auto would it's different

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780 
like any other Auto would it's different
because<00:03:29.109> basically<00:03:29.829> it's<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.129> manual<00:03:30.489> gearbox

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
because basically it's a manual gearbox

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.650 
because basically it's a manual gearbox
that<00:03:31.120> uses<00:03:31.629> hydraulic<00:03:32.079> actuators<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.150> ECU<00:03:34.150> to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
that uses hydraulic actuators and ECU to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.930 
that uses hydraulic actuators and ECU to
change<00:03:34.959> gears<00:03:35.290> for<00:03:35.379> you<00:03:35.680> eliminating<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.730> use

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
change gears for you eliminating the use

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.330 
change gears for you eliminating the use
of<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.239> clutch<00:03:37.480> for<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.870> driver

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.180 

and<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:41.000> easy<00:03:41.390> drive<00:03:41.870> actually<00:03:42.350> makes<00:03:42.950> it

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
and this easy drive actually makes it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.620 
and this easy drive actually makes it
really<00:03:43.910> easy<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.690> drive

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
really easy to drive

what makes it really easy to drive is
this<00:03:58.850> automatic<00:03:59.420> manual<00:03:59.660> transmission<00:04:00.560> it

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
this automatic manual transmission it

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.479 
this automatic manual transmission it
works<00:04:01.610> as<00:04:01.790> good<00:04:02.000> as<00:04:02.120> any<00:04:02.500> otterbox<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.770> fact<00:04:04.370> I

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
works as good as any otterbox in fact I

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.850 
works as good as any otterbox in fact I
think<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.760> only<00:04:04.940> real<00:04:05.330> difference<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:06.140> you

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
think the only real difference is you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.280 
think the only real difference is you
can<00:04:07.010> feel<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.430> when<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.060> gears<00:04:08.300> shift<00:04:08.720> whether

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
can feel it when the gears shift whether

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.470 
can feel it when the gears shift whether
it's<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.560> downshift<00:04:09.800> or<00:04:10.280> an<00:04:10.400> upshift<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:11.209> do

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
it's a downshift or an upshift you do

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.360 
it's a downshift or an upshift you do
know<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.020> happening<00:04:12.170> but<00:04:13.040> otherwise

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
know that it's happening but otherwise

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.860 
know that it's happening but otherwise
in<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.910> it's<00:04:14.180> really<00:04:14.720> really<00:04:15.110> practical<00:04:16.870> you

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
in that it's really really practical you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.199 
in that it's really really practical you
can<00:04:17.900> just<00:04:18.230> be<00:04:18.620> lazy<00:04:18.859> when<00:04:19.340> you're<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.730> traffic

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
can just be lazy when you're in traffic

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.510 
can just be lazy when you're in traffic
and<00:04:20.359> let<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> auto<00:04:21.230> box<00:04:21.500> do<00:04:21.709> its<00:04:21.859> own<00:04:21.980> work<00:04:22.040> or

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
and let the auto box do its own work or

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.180 
and let the auto box do its own work or
then<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.540> can<00:04:23.810> shift<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.500> into<00:04:24.650> manual<00:04:24.919> mode

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
then you can shift it into manual mode

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.620 
then you can shift it into manual mode
and<00:04:26.919> then<00:04:27.919> use<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.220> as<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.880> would<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.240> manual

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and then use it as you would a manual

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:37.690 
and then use it as you would a manual
gearbox<00:04:35.200> so<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.350> was<00:04:36.530> how<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.710> really<00:04:37.430> works

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
gearbox so that was how it really works

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.700 
gearbox so that was how it really works

really<00:05:44.240> brand<00:05:44.510> image<00:05:44.810> they<00:05:45.350> need<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.710> try<00:05:45.890> and

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
really brand image they need to try and

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.860 
really brand image they need to try and
go<00:05:46.100> upscale<00:05:46.670> but<00:05:46.820> they<00:05:47.000> fail<00:05:47.210> miserably<00:05:47.450> when

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
go upscale but they fail miserably when

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.150 
go upscale but they fail miserably when
they've<00:05:48.020> tried<00:05:48.140> to<00:05:48.230> do<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:48.860> really<00:05:48.950> it

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
they've tried to do that so really it

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.410 
they've tried to do that so really it
looks<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.490> waste<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.910> time<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.300> them

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
looks like a waste of time to them

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.540 
looks like a waste of time to them
because<00:05:50.690> their<00:05:51.200> DNA<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.710> four<00:05:51.950> big<00:05:52.130> volumes

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
because their DNA is four big volumes

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.550 
because their DNA is four big volumes
and<00:05:52.760> they<00:05:52.880> find<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.780> know<00:05:53.840> cars<00:05:54.140> with<00:05:54.320> small

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
and they find you know cars with small

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.990 
and they find you know cars with small
volume<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.040> distraction<00:05:55.610> and<00:05:55.760> they<00:05:55.820> don't

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
volume the distraction and they don't

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.850 
volume the distraction and they don't
focus<00:05:56.210> on<00:05:56.510> it<00:05:56.570> or<00:05:56.900> don't<00:05:57.230> have<00:05:57.290> commitment

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
focus on it or don't have commitment

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.450 
focus on it or don't have commitment
towards<00:05:58.160> it

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
towards it

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.920 
towards it
but<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:58.880> think<00:05:59.060> you<00:05:59.450> know<00:05:59.540> there<00:05:59.690> are<00:05:59.780> the

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
but I think you know there are the

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.240 
but I think you know there are the
issues<00:06:00.110> from<00:06:00.230> our<00:06:00.380> ot<00:06:00.620> they<00:06:00.860> really<00:06:01.100> need<00:06:01.190> to

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
issues from our ot they really need to

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.770 
issues from our ot they really need to
get<00:06:01.430> their<00:06:01.550> styling<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.150> little<00:06:02.390> bit<00:06:02.510> more

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
get their styling a little bit more

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.230 
get their styling a little bit more
sexier<00:06:03.650> so<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:03.920> speak<00:06:04.280> in<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:04.880> sense<00:06:05.120> that

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
sexier so to speak in the sense that

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.750 
sexier so to speak in the sense that
even<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:05.990> Celerio<00:06:06.440> I<00:06:06.620> think<00:06:07.010> it's<00:06:07.400> a<00:06:07.550> great

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
even the Celerio I think it's a great

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.970 
even the Celerio I think it's a great
package<00:06:07.970> good<00:06:08.660> space<00:06:08.930> rides<00:06:09.410> well<00:06:09.650> but<00:06:09.860> the

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
package good space rides well but the

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.980 
package good space rides well but the
styling<00:06:10.220> a<00:06:10.490> little<00:06:10.700> bit<00:06:10.820> too<00:06:11.000> timid<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:11.540> I

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
styling a little bit too timid and I

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.810 
styling a little bit too timid and I
think<00:06:12.200> that's<00:06:12.350> really<00:06:12.530> where<00:06:12.800> companies<00:06:13.700> like

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
think that's really where companies like

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.940 
think that's really where companies like
Hyundai<00:06:14.600> and<00:06:14.840> all<00:06:14.990> I've<00:06:15.200> really<00:06:15.440> taken<00:06:15.590> the

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
Hyundai and all I've really taken the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.470 
Hyundai and all I've really taken the
lead<00:06:15.980> in<00:06:16.100> that<00:06:16.370> they've<00:06:16.700> also<00:06:16.850> spoken<00:06:17.210> of<00:06:17.360> the

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
lead in that they've also spoken of the

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.970 
lead in that they've also spoken of the
fuel<00:06:17.720> efficiency<00:06:17.840> bit<00:06:18.440> I<00:06:18.470> think<00:06:18.770> they<00:06:18.890> are

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
fuel efficiency bit I think they are

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.100 
fuel efficiency bit I think they are
saying<00:06:19.190> that<00:06:19.280> it<00:06:19.490> is<00:06:19.520> going<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.420> be<00:06:20.510> about<00:06:20.660> 23

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
saying that it is going to be about 23

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.360 
saying that it is going to be about 23
kilometers<00:06:21.560> per<00:06:21.740> litre<00:06:21.920> which<00:06:22.040> is<00:06:22.190> quite

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
kilometers per litre which is quite

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.100 
kilometers per litre which is quite

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
very fuel efficient and I think the k10

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.800 
very fuel efficient and I think the k10
has<00:06:31.370> been<00:06:31.550> tweaked<00:06:31.790> further<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.270> you<00:06:32.690> know

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
further be better on fuel efficiency so

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.300 
further be better on fuel efficiency so
no<00:06:35.660> issues<00:06:35.960> over<00:06:36.230> there<00:06:36.380> so<00:06:36.530> Maruti<00:06:36.890> strengths
