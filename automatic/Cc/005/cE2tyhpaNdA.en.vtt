00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello friends it will somehow times 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.649
 again that time again 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.240
 make favorites and yes that stands 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.740
 Somehow everything behind me here 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.179
 have it lined up nicely and I will 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 try as soon as possible 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 somehow detailed by this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.000
 go through all things once you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.680
 to introduce you and you know if I am 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 have favorites then has been what 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.269
 to be called because I'm really laid 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.820
 I would say it is not a new one 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.650
 favorit in the sense but the application 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 is now a new favorite and again 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 that would be coconut oil with coconut oil that you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 I have a lot to do 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.910
 once a video made 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.469
 I think maybe I should still 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.960
 times make a second video to because 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 Coconut oil so fucking diverse is me 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.350
 I have started again the europol 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 to do in a way that means I take 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.950
 in the morning from the toothbrush where you something 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.890
 She has eaten or drunk me 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 that between the teeth 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 720 minutes and very important to spit out 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.710
 yes, do not swallow the oil 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 should collect toxins and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 get the teeth up and that's why 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.979
 I coconut oil now very loved especially 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.159
 somehow it solves the place extremely man 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.409
 I have extremely smooth teeth somehow 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 if you have a coconut oil video of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 I would like to have one below 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 comment below and so i got myself 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.619
 yes, always with the team detergent 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.780
 washed out in weight so that for yourself 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.970
 so have a mini make up on it and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 That's why I have some times with some 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.409
 washing lotions through the ingredients 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 Looked and I have the situation for 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.100
 bought dry house I always do it 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 so I put up little in hand 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 foams and then only occasionally on the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.770
 I also give things where I really am 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 Make-up on it had that skin not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 dried out too much 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.670
 but the good part is really 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.009
 that I do not have strong tensions 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.140
 afterwards and who the dermatitis 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329
 has not deteriorated what a lot 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 good at the matthias leads me to 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.430
 second product after this step 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.049
 I use this step that's that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.640
 for the hypo all jenny comic relief 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.040
 creams for dry irritated and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.810
 itchy skin and that i have in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.810
 bought a pharmacy that really has 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.650
 Cost 20 euros but people I understand 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.569
 not why this product is not 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.129
 for just about every skin type or so 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.319
 I offered my will at some point 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.670
 never look at it today 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 that means there are no pimples and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.010
 there are no blackheads out there 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.930
 Residual moisture returns to the skin 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.650
 back without allergies 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.019
 it is not in it what is inside me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.030
 would not have caused it now 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.790
 to buy this cream needs 20 euro 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.879
 really just really really little so 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.530
 I need very little and the 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.920
 dermatitis has gotten better 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.079
 it's just a hypoallergenic base 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.069
 base cream I would like that quite normal 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.000
 call without any irritating crass 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.370
 cash drawer for disney fabrics and 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.349
 I still do not understand him 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.209
 me the comfortable but what is going on 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.950
 why is not that sold the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.950
 next three products you can see here and 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.329
 These are beauty decorative cosmetics 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.250
 The first ones I brought you money in 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.590
 the camera holds that it is the kathrin 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.060
 Absolutely palette I do not know what my 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.329
 problem is but somehow can be 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.340
 always with me this gold lettering 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.260
 five euros costs absolutely awesome thing 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.989
 and taking the good part is highlighter 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.579
 too in angle and above 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.209
 This sound here is my eyebrows 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.659
 Ton and herewith I have myself today 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.519
 the eyes make up so therefore 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.290
 love here is another gray tone in it 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.209
 so far you either found yours 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.430
 Master I really use everyone 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.479
 single tone and when when when can 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.239
 that's the case of a palette 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:48.280
 say great the next part is this 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.209
 here it is the long lasting letter one 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.909
 by katrin 0 20 / ibrows i believe 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.489
 I only caught a product on Mondays respectively 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.159
 an empty product caught because hardly 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.049
 product comes out but when he paints then 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.060
 but also painted correctly you can 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.519
 really great as single hairs purely 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.260
 if you somehow draw the brown ones 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.079
 are too thin or something and that is just 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.669
 I can not tip a fiche pen 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.070
 more people talk and the last one 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.820
 decorative 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.700
 Cosmetic product is actually no 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.090
 decorative cosmetic product because it is 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.940
 a brush that was reduced at h &amp; m and 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.520
 I love it because of the absolutely fluid 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.220
 is only rose gold what more could you want 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.290
 Woman because we women love rose gold 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.500
 Let's just say it as it is 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.950
 love rose gold you behind there 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.260
 you do not like rose gold twice 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.280
 just no woman so that I am 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.320
 now in the room 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.810
 There should now be synonymous one 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.460
 This incredibly cool part I 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.170
 so far always for my contours 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.020
 or bronzing powder around here 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.320
 a bit and point the cheekbones 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.990
 to make a powder brush of mine 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.310
 mother from the eighties or something 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.530
 does not know who is hollow 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.440
 was the flat, and I thought 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.670
 then I'm so horny h &amp; m 50 I take 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.080
 now with you and you see people and he 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.300
 is soft I love him 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.890
 we are coming and should actually 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.810
 you probably already know the brand 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.720
 at about every German youtuber 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.750
 meanwhile larry imagines that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.970
 is available in the rossmann bar 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.150
 or in the pipe hoffmann 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.010
 theke and I have the lady diamond that 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.610
 smells very oriental for me 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.610
 That's a mix 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:43.760
 beware of alien with black opium and a 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.800
 little of my darling still sander 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.690
 Rangnicks that means these are the three 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.090
 favorite things I always layer 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.930
 on me and this year costs 6 6 or 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.790
 7 euro for such a huge part and me 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.980
 Anyway, even if it does 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.290
 eau de toilettes I think the smell holds 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.980
 relatively long and for 67 euros you can 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.140
 really nothing to say runs and we 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.740
 actually come to the last 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.690
 favorites this is a lifestyle favorite 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.460
 I still had it somehow 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.110
 I do not do fashion at all 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.580
 again just an extra video people 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.910
 What do you think 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.690
 I will definitely lifestyle 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.660
 Of course that's big of sofia 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.580
 russo means good 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.800
 I am not German after all 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.410
 chapter us today after each chapter 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.770
 I put this book away and put her 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.670
 Tips for that is the cio of nas tiger 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.140
 which has an ebay shop pro familia 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.300
 some things stolen and has them 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.180
 ebay used and this company 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.900
 is now over 28 million dollars 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.430

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.300

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.710
 woman is absolutely sympathetic absolutely 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.570
 written rousingly 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.550
 I have not read for a long time 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.100
 should again the book has me 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.140
 reminded and as I said after each 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.850
 Chapter I thought so cool 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.940
