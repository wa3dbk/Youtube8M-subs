the<00:00:52.469> whole<00:00:52.530> complexion<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> rest<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the whole complexion of the rest of the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.959

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
series and the Miami Heat won I don't

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
series and the Miami Heat won I don't
think<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.329> necessarily<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
think that's necessarily going to be the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
think that's necessarily going to be the
case<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.620> year<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> San<00:00:59.969> Antonio

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
case this year I think the San Antonio

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
case this year I think the San Antonio
Spurs<00:01:00.539> simply<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.530> too<00:01:01.739> many<00:01:01.890> bodies<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
Spurs simply have too many bodies to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
Spurs simply have too many bodies to
throw<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.719> think<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.229> why<00:01:04.409> they

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
throw out there I think that's why they

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.370 
throw out there I think that's why they
defeated<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.339> Oklahoma<00:01:06.000> City<00:01:06.240> Thunder

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
besides all of the turnovers and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
besides all of the turnovers and
occasional<00:01:09.330> wild<00:01:09.689> shots<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> San

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
occasional wild shots I think the San

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
occasional wild shots I think the San
Antonio<00:01:11.189> Spurs<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> win<00:01:12.450> are
