00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
convert and as you can see the files

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.350 
convert and as you can see the files
right<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.820> don't<00:03:23.940> want<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> mess<00:03:24.239> of

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
right here but you don't want a mess of

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.930 
right here but you don't want a mess of
the<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.480> could<00:03:24.810> still<00:03:25.170> converting<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.940> when

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
the I could still converting so when

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.960 
the I could still converting so when
it's<00:03:27.300> done<00:03:27.450> converting<00:03:28.280> I'll<00:03:29.280> show<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.790> what

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it's done converting I'll show you what

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.420 
it's done converting I'll show you what
to<00:03:30.000> do<00:03:30.180> next<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.680> very<00:03:31.860> simple<00:03:32.070> step

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
to do next it's just a very simple step

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.060 
to do next it's just a very simple step
um<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.630> yeah<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.410> said<00:03:34.620> if<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.890> already

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
um so yeah like I said if you already

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.699 
um so yeah like I said if you already
have<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.670> custom<00:03:36.480> firmware<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.959> there<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
have the custom firmware on there to the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.780 
have the custom firmware on there to the
point<00:03:37.980> where<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.640> run<00:03:39.090> um<00:03:40.790> emulators

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
point where you can run um emulators

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.100 
point where you can run um emulators
your<00:03:41.940> stuff<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.510> should<00:03:42.720> be<00:03:42.870> fine<00:03:43.110> um<00:03:43.880> but

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
your stuff and you should be fine um but

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.910 
your stuff and you should be fine um but
yeah<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.820> conversion<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.239> almost<00:03:48.390> done<00:03:48.600> um

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
yeah so the conversion is almost done um

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.050 
yeah so the conversion is almost done um
depending<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.130> size<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.370> your<00:03:50.549> file<00:03:50.850> it

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
depending on the size of your file it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.120 
depending on the size of your file it
might<00:03:51.239> take<00:03:51.480> longer<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.650> bigger<00:03:52.830> file

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
might take longer if it's a bigger file

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.759 
might take longer if it's a bigger file
it<00:03:53.660> shouldn't<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.870> long<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.470> smaller

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
it shouldn't be that long it's a smaller

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.289 
it shouldn't be that long it's a smaller
file<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.850> it's<00:03:57.150> done<00:03:57.360> alright<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.970> now<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.269> I
