00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.410
 karim mokaddem hello you are you 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.120
 are director of the hybrid project erscia 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
 psa then a first question is this 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 that could briefly summarize the interest 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 the operation of the hybrid system r 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 so the hybrid system r that's the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.690
 combination of two energies as a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.369
 hybrid moon that comes from an engine 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.119
 thermal here our 3 cylinder engine 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.820
 essence and another that is obtained by 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.929
 air compression in a battery 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.000
 originating these three modes a mode 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
 essence an air mode and a combined mode 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.860
 the most differentiating mode and the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.450
 modern so r mode is the one that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.590
 is particularly well suited to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 urban situations 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 you are driving in town 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 you often have for reasons 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.980
 various and varied 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 you will have to brake decelerated in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.360
 a classic vehicle this energy is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.990
 lost dispel what the system allows 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.780
 hybrid rc recovered almost 95% of these 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.760
 situations to allow storing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 this energy in the form of compressed air 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.990
 so how does that make the energy that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.970
 you lose will put into operation 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.160
 hydraulic components that have 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.260
 this ability to be able to recover very 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.850
 fast energy these components 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.700
 hydraulics will set in motion a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.830
 hydraulic fluid that will transmit 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 this energy up to 1 piston which is 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.360
 in our incubator and the piston goes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.770
 really worked at the analog of a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.619
 syringe that is to say that lille is going 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.690
 push a piston that will compress 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.270
 the air a contrario when you go 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.070
 want to recover this energy as 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.259
 in a syringe as in a spring 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 when the air is going to be tablets it goes 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.640
 push this piston that will make itself 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.810
 move the oil to components 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.240
 hydraulic systems that at this point are 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
 act as engines and it's the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.560
 motors directly connected to a box 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.520
 specific speeds that will make 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.260
 advance the vehicle 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 what type of vehicle it is for 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.890
 from small cars to sedans this 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.960
 that we think is that this 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 technology particularly well suited 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.790
 for segments b and that's why 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.830
 because these are segments where you 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.230
 going 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 use your vehicle in situation 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.840
 urban development frequently 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.240
 type c3 type 208 cars type 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.400
 308 and then type 2008 because you 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.990
 have seen that on the stand Peugeot that to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.490
 2008 which is put forward with this 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.930
 technology is that it is more 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.400
 compared to a hybrid system 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.420
 classic we use a battery 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.130
 electric 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.580
 is it cheaper what it is 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.260
 more efficient then the ability to 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.610
 energy recovery in 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.660
 braking and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.810
 deceleration 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.490
 it is optimal with one of the systems 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.190
 who operates hydraulic components 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.090
 and it's inherent in technology 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.709
 the other interest you mentioned it 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.459
 this is the blow we think today 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.640
 that this solution for segments b 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.740
 and it's extremely competitive because 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.959
 that it allows to offer a full system 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.760
 hybrid for all then other systems 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.760
 hybrids will arrive on the market for 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.319
 microhybrid systems with battery 48 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.329
 capacitors volts 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.099
 will that be systems 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.599
 Hybrids still affordable 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.180
 will not it be competitors of the 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.010
 hybrid system r these are products 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.760
 completely different and we are there 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.370
 are also working on micro hybridization 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 Hybrid miles are products that 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.930
 today can be adapted on 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.670
 diesel petrol engines but who 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.079
 today in terms of gains from 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.819
 consumption do not allow 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.769
 to reach the targets we have 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.419
 with a full hybrid hybrid type r 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.760
 no, they are different products 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.069
 one last question when do we 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.439
 can see the first hybrid model 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.540
 happened his market we think 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.299
 today that 2016 is a target 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.939
 achievable the stake today for 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.409
 we are getting to put in place a 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.819
 mass production of components 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.349
 hydraulics that are today in 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.680
 his vehicles and that are not 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.659
 products at his rates the video thank you
