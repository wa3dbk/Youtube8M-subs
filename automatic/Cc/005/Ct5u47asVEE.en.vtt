a name that has no meaning whatsoever

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.730 
a name that has no meaning whatsoever
and<00:04:58.670> Istanbul<00:04:59.720> actually<00:05:00.720> is<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:01.290> meaningless

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
and Istanbul actually is a meaningless

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.150 
and Istanbul actually is a meaningless
name<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:03.120> does<00:05:03.360> not<00:05:03.540> signify<00:05:04.170> anything

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
name it does not signify anything

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.410 
name it does not signify anything
it<00:05:05.340> simply<00:05:06.270> means<00:05:06.570> in<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.560> city<00:05:08.210> we<00:05:09.210> might

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
it simply means in the city we might

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.400 
it simply means in the city we might
express<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.140> as<00:05:10.350> downtown<00:05:11.720> Istanbul<00:05:12.720> as<00:05:12.930> far

express it as downtown Istanbul as far

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.480 
express it as downtown Istanbul as far
as<00:05:13.620> meaning<00:05:14.100> goes<00:05:14.280> is<00:05:14.580> meaningless<00:05:15.330> and

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
as meaning goes is meaningless and

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.180 
as meaning goes is meaningless and
therefore<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.730> very<00:05:18.630> good<00:05:18.870> indication<00:05:19.410> that

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
therefore a very good indication that

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.810 
therefore a very good indication that
the<00:05:20.370> Antichrist<00:05:21.090> will<00:05:21.450> come<00:05:21.510> from<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.170> city

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
the Antichrist will come from that city

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.730 
the Antichrist will come from that city
so<00:05:23.820> why<00:05:24.060> is<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:24.300> important<00:05:24.990> for<00:05:25.050> us<00:05:25.230> to<00:05:25.530> know

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
so why is it important for us to know

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.640 
so why is it important for us to know
where<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.430> Antichrist<00:05:26.730> comes<00:05:27.150> from<00:05:27.660> it's

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
where the Antichrist comes from it's

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.800
