00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
something organic that you're used to

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.170 
something organic that you're used to
kind<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.380> holding<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:06.770> your<00:04:06.860> hand<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:08.060> this

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
kind of holding in your hand and in this

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.550 
kind of holding in your hand and in this
way<00:04:08.390> it's<00:04:08.540> really<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.870> same<00:04:09.050> thing<00:04:09.080> with<00:04:09.470> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
way it's really the same thing with the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.990 
way it's really the same thing with the
music<00:04:09.680> where<00:04:10.130> we're<00:04:10.460> sitting<00:04:10.700> here<00:04:10.730> looking

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
music where we're sitting here looking

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.820 
music where we're sitting here looking
at<00:04:11.270> computer<00:04:11.720> screens<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.620> reality

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
at computer screens but in reality

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.710 
at computer screens but in reality
you're<00:04:13.400> capturing<00:04:13.940> all<00:04:14.210> the<00:04:14.330> sound<00:04:14.570> with

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
you're capturing all the sound with

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.870 
you're capturing all the sound with
microphones<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.530> you're<00:04:15.650> capturing<00:04:16.100> humans

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
microphones and you're capturing humans

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.229 
microphones and you're capturing humans
you<00:04:17.540> know<00:04:17.590> blowing<00:04:18.590> on<00:04:18.739> things<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.250> playing

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
you know blowing on things and playing

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.970 
you know blowing on things and playing
stuff<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.810> bowing<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.350> doing<00:04:21.830> all<00:04:21.890> these

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
stuff and bowing and doing all these

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.350 
stuff and bowing and doing all these
things<00:04:22.040> that<00:04:22.280> generate<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.880> senate<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.240> it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
things that generate the senate and it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.550 
things that generate the senate and it
comes<00:04:23.570> through<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.900> even<00:04:24.170> those<00:04:24.290> coming

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
comes through you even those coming

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.230 
comes through you even those coming
through<00:04:24.650> these<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.370> know<00:04:25.490> over<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.910> internet

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
through these you know over the internet

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.540 
through these you know over the internet
it<00:04:26.540> still<00:04:26.810> retains<00:04:27.140> that<00:04:27.260> humanity<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.070> it's

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
it still retains that humanity so it's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.700 
it still retains that humanity so it's
kind<00:04:28.730> of<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.880> interesting<00:04:29.780> parallel<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.410> me<00:04:30.530> as

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
kind of a interesting parallel to me as

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.310 
kind of a interesting parallel to me as
almost<00:04:31.700> like<00:04:31.820> building<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.360> Lego<00:04:32.690> kit<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.230> know

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
almost like building a Lego kit you know

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.410 
almost like building a Lego kit you know
you<00:04:33.380> build<00:04:33.860> your<00:04:34.040> your<00:04:34.610> music<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.300> then<00:04:35.390> you

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
you build your your music and then you

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.690 
you build your your music and then you
have<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.990> live<00:04:36.620> musicians<00:04:37.130> play<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.610> it

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
have the live musicians play it and it

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.790 
have the live musicians play it and it
comes<00:04:37.880> back<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.590> it's<00:04:39.590> been

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
comes back to you and it's been

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.920 
comes back to you and it's been
fantastic<00:04:40.000> weirdly<00:04:41.000> enough<00:04:41.120> I<00:04:41.270> what<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.600> want

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
fantastic weirdly enough I what I want

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.480 
fantastic weirdly enough I what I want
people<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.350> experience<00:04:42.740> at<00:04:42.920> least<00:04:42.950> is<00:04:43.220> kind<00:04:43.430> of

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
people to experience at least is kind of

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.820 
people to experience at least is kind of
walk<00:04:43.940> away<00:04:44.120> from<00:04:44.480> it<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.900> when<00:04:45.440> they<00:04:45.560> go<00:04:45.680> into

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
walk away from it and when they go into

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.820 
walk away from it and when they go into
their<00:04:45.980> regular<00:04:46.730> lives<00:04:47.330> or<00:04:47.660> go<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.140> school<00:04:48.530> or

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
their regular lives or go to school or

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.530 
their regular lives or go to school or
go<00:04:48.980> to<00:04:49.010> their<00:04:49.220> job<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.670> to<00:04:49.850> kind<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.330> have<00:04:50.510> that

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
go to their job is to kind of have that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.780 
go to their job is to kind of have that
Lego<00:04:51.530> universe<00:04:51.920> music<00:04:52.280> playing<00:04:52.550> through<00:04:52.700> the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
Lego universe music playing through the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.860 
Lego universe music playing through the
head<00:04:52.970> because<00:04:53.150> that's<00:04:53.240> what<00:04:53.450> they<00:04:53.540> can<00:04:53.690> take

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
head because that's what they can take

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.930 
head because that's what they can take
with<00:04:54.080> them<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.920> can<00:04:55.160> be<00:04:55.310> kicking<00:04:55.820> around

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
with them and that can be kicking around

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.810 
with them and that can be kicking around
up<00:04:56.270> there<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:57.160> maybe<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.280> makes<00:04:58.460> life<00:04:58.730> a

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
up there and and maybe it makes life a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.510 
up there and and maybe it makes life a
little<00:04:58.970> bit<00:04:59.150> more<00:04:59.300> fun
