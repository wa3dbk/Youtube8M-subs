00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.839 
story so let's go back to export movie
and<00:02:10.769> we'll<00:02:11.769> go<00:02:11.860> ahead<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.069> do<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.280> medium<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:12.819> I

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
and we'll go ahead and do it medium so I

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.059 
and we'll go ahead and do it medium so I
can<00:02:13.060> put<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.299> on<00:02:13.360> my<00:02:13.480> iPad<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.769> we'll<00:02:14.890> go<00:02:14.980> to

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
can put it on my iPad so we'll go to

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.319 
can put it on my iPad so we'll go to
export<00:02:15.579> and<00:02:15.849> we'll<00:02:16.360> call<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:18.569> Clifton's

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
export and we'll call this Clifton's

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.850 
export and we'll call this Clifton's
I'll<00:02:22.329> put<00:02:22.540> up<00:02:22.629> one<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.019> usually<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.500> putting<00:02:23.799> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
I'll put up one I usually like putting a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.470 
I'll put up one I usually like putting a
one<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.160> front<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.519> too<00:02:24.879> so<00:02:24.910> it's<00:02:25.150> easier<00:02:25.420> to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
one in front of it too so it's easier to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.660 
one in front of it too so it's easier to
find<00:02:25.690> because<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.140> always<00:02:26.440> comes<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.950> our

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
find because one always comes up in our

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.350 
find because one always comes up in our
search<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.900> we'll<00:02:29.290> go<00:02:29.379> to<00:02:29.500> export<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:33.360> this

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
search so we'll go to export and this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.600 
search so we'll go to export and this
may<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> few<00:02:35.049> minutes<00:02:35.579> one<00:02:36.579> minute

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
may just take a few minutes one minute

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.789 
may just take a few minutes one minute
but<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.690> magic<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.049> editing<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.590> will

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
but with the magic of editing I will

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.240 
but with the magic of editing I will
make<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:40.060> take<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.299> minute<00:02:41.100> okay<00:02:42.100> and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
make this not take a minute okay and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.870 
make this not take a minute okay and
there<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.519> go<00:02:42.690> movie<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.720> exported<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.880> we'll
