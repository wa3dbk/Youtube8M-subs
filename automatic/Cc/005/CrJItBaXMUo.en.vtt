00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.700 

um<00:00:10.330> I<00:00:10.930> started<00:00:11.770> with<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.750> subpart<00:00:14.290> which<00:00:14.530> is

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
um I started with the subpart which is

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.580 
um I started with the subpart which is
underneath<00:00:15.100> your<00:00:15.340> feet<00:00:15.550> and<00:00:15.910> this<00:00:16.869> is<00:00:17.050> built

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
underneath your feet and this is built

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.490 
underneath your feet and this is built
on<00:00:17.710> a<00:00:17.770> stone<00:00:18.070> beasts<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.869> set<00:00:20.080> in<00:00:20.110> clay

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
on a stone beasts and it's set in clay

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.679 
on a stone beasts and it's set in clay
and<00:00:20.830> you<00:00:21.760> know<00:00:21.849> between<00:00:22.029> the<00:00:22.240> water<00:00:22.450> damage

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
and you know between the water damage

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.130 
and you know between the water damage
and<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.230> clay<00:00:23.770> drying<00:00:24.189> out<00:00:24.450> it<00:00:25.450> was<00:00:25.930> like<00:00:26.050> an

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
and the clay drying out it was like an

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.790 
and the clay drying out it was like an
hour<00:00:26.259> glass<00:00:26.410> effect<00:00:26.770> and<00:00:27.250> all<00:00:27.910> of<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:29.169> clay

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
hour glass effect and all of the clay

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.639 
hour glass effect and all of the clay
and<00:00:30.160> rubble<00:00:30.939> had<00:00:31.119> seeped<00:00:31.720> down<00:00:31.840> through<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:32.590> it

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
and rubble had seeped down through so it

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.520 
and rubble had seeped down through so it
was<00:00:32.770> like<00:00:32.829> a<00:00:32.890> sinkhole<00:00:33.399> right<00:00:33.850> here<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:35.320> dug

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
was like a sinkhole right here we dug

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.900 
was like a sinkhole right here we dug
down<00:00:36.660> poured<00:00:37.660> concrete<00:00:37.870> so<00:00:38.860> now<00:00:39.550> we<00:00:39.610> have<00:00:39.760> a

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
down poured concrete so now we have a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.830 
down poured concrete so now we have a
stable<00:00:40.809> base<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.800> then<00:00:41.980> once<00:00:42.310> we<00:00:42.460> did<00:00:42.580> that<00:00:42.840> we

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
stable base and then once we did that we

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.170 
stable base and then once we did that we
took<00:00:44.110> apart<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.560> back<00:00:44.800> wall<00:00:45.130> and<00:00:45.370> tunnel<00:00:46.030> then

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
took apart the back wall and tunnel then

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.040 
took apart the back wall and tunnel then
and<00:00:46.540> rebuilt<00:00:47.260> sections<00:00:47.860> from<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.430> inside<00:00:48.760> out

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and rebuilt sections from the inside out

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.900 
and rebuilt sections from the inside out
and<00:00:50.050> then<00:00:50.200> we<00:00:50.380> built<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:51.220> entire<00:00:51.430> back<00:00:51.880> wall

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
and then we built this entire back wall

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.210 
and then we built this entire back wall
the<00:00:52.660> opening<00:00:52.990> to<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.170> ash<00:00:53.320> pick<00:00:53.620> which<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.100> an

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
the opening to the ash pick which is an

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.980 
the opening to the ash pick which is an
arch<00:00:54.540> an<00:00:55.540> archway<00:00:55.960> here<00:00:57.240> then<00:00:58.240> continued<00:00:58.870> on

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
arch an archway here then continued on

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.310 
arch an archway here then continued on
to<00:00:59.260> this<00:00:59.380> bake<00:00:59.620> oven<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:01.990> key<00:01:02.170> way

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
to this bake oven there's a key way

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.030 
to this bake oven there's a key way
right<00:01:02.800> here<00:01:03.130> as<00:01:03.310> you<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.490> see<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
right here as you can see that is the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.450 
right here as you can see that is the
pinnacle<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.270> arch<00:01:07.509> and<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.890> column<00:01:09.159> is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
pinnacle of the arch and this column is

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.990 
pinnacle of the arch and this column is
rebuilt<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:11.170> column<00:01:11.650> as<00:01:11.799> well<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.310> just<00:01:12.820> did

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
rebuilt this column as well I just did

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.169 
rebuilt this column as well I just did
recently<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.740> this<00:01:15.009> arch<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.549> almost

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
recently and this arch is almost

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.080 
recently and this arch is almost
complete<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:17.710> rebuild<00:01:18.340> bake<00:01:18.579> oven<00:01:18.909> that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
complete and a rebuild bake oven that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.099 
complete and a rebuild bake oven that
was<00:01:19.659> found<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:21.159> had<00:01:21.340> been<00:01:22.109> completely

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
was found that had been completely

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:29.999 
was found that had been completely
closed<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.969> we<00:01:26.909> restored<00:01:27.909> this<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.770> this

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
closed in so we restored this and this

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.239 
closed in so we restored this and this
right<00:01:30.969> here<00:01:30.999> is<00:01:31.509> where<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:32.499> door<00:01:32.679> would<00:01:32.950> since

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
right here is where the door would since

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.919 
right here is where the door would since
its<00:01:33.609> we<00:01:34.149> call<00:01:34.359> it<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.859> birds<00:01:35.859> beak<00:01:36.009> or<00:01:36.490> crows<00:01:37.030> and

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
its we call it a birds beak or crows and

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.090 
its we call it a birds beak or crows and
that<00:01:38.709> is<00:01:38.979> where

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that is where

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700 
that is where
goes<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.400> table<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.030> it's<00:01:43.180> caught<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:43.900> it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
goes in a table and it's caught so it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.840 
goes in a table and it's caught so it
keeps<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.190> from<00:01:45.370> coming<00:01:45.760> back<00:01:45.940> out<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
keeps that from coming back out and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.270 
keeps that from coming back out and
other<00:01:48.850> things<00:01:49.090> we've<00:01:49.270> done<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:50.160> rebuilt<00:01:51.160> this

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
other things we've done is rebuilt this

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.050 
other things we've done is rebuilt this
left<00:01:51.580> side<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.990> started<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.590> stucco<00:01:54.160> some<00:01:54.910> of

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
left side and started to stucco some of

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.910 
left side and started to stucco some of
the<00:01:55.600> patching<00:01:56.050> which<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.680> quite

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
the patching which is this is quite

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.540 
the patching which is this is quite
barging<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.840> some<00:01:59.080> marsh<00:01:59.770> grasses<00:02:00.190> where<00:02:00.460> they

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
barging in some marsh grasses where they

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.430 
barging in some marsh grasses where they
mixed<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.030> instead<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.660> like<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.900> fiberglass

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
mixed in instead of like a fiberglass

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.860 
mixed in instead of like a fiberglass
back<00:02:02.830> down<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.160> use<00:02:04.650> grass<00:02:05.650> or<00:02:06.540> horsehair<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
back down to use grass or horsehair it

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.300 
back down to use grass or horsehair it
was<00:02:08.050> very<00:02:08.200> common<00:02:08.440> as<00:02:08.760> a<00:02:09.760> as<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:11.560> a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
was very common as a as a as a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.360 
was very common as a as a as a
reinforcement<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.770> can<00:02:14.920> see<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.070> hole<00:02:15.340> right

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
reinforcement you can see a hole right

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.170 
reinforcement you can see a hole right
here<00:02:15.610> which<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.450> where<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> lug<00:02:17.200> pole<00:02:17.470> was

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
here which is where a lug pole was

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.730 
here which is where a lug pole was
before<00:02:19.180> they<00:02:19.540> use<00:02:20.310> steel<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.020> as<00:02:23.020> much<00:02:23.320> they

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
before they use steel and as much they

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.910 
before they use steel and as much they
use<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:25.150> saplings<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.230> actually<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.710> piece<00:02:26.890> of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
use like saplings so actually a piece of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.660 
use like saplings so actually a piece of
wood<00:02:27.510> ran<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.660> from<00:02:28.900> front<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.680> back<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.250> then

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
wood ran in from front to back and then

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.900 
wood ran in from front to back and then
they<00:02:30.850> hung<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:32.190> kettles<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.490> stuff<00:02:33.700> off<00:02:33.880> of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
they hung there kettles and stuff off of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.620 
they hung there kettles and stuff off of
that<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.270> special<00:02:35.230> joint<00:02:35.440> normal<00:02:36.280> one<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:37.330> long

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
that a special joint normal one is long

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.170 
that a special joint normal one is long
like<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.860> one's<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.610> nimble<00:02:39.910> in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
like that this one's really nimble in

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.130 
like that this one's really nimble in
tight<00:02:40.420> tight<00:02:40.690> here<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:42.700> works<00:02:42.880> really<00:02:43.000> well
