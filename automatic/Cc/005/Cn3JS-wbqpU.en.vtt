00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
here my father-in-law gave us this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.250 
here my father-in-law gave us this
beetle<00:00:59.969> bag<00:01:00.149> thing<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> while<00:01:00.690> ago<00:01:00.960> along<00:01:01.199> with

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.349 
beetle bag thing a while ago along with
this<00:01:01.559> post<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.010> put<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:03.000> went<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this post to put in and I went to the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
this post to put in and I went to the
store<00:01:03.570> today<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.350> bought<00:01:04.530> some<00:01:04.680> these

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
store today and I bought some these

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.060 
store today and I bought some these
Japanese<00:01:05.549> beetle<00:01:05.909> bait<00:01:06.119> things<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Japanese beetle bait things and so it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
Japanese beetle bait things and so it
lures<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:09.990> this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
lures them in and then they go into this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
lures them in and then they go into this
thing<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.680> pretty<00:01:11.070> much<00:01:11.189> die<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.820> now

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
thing and pretty much die in there now

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.850 
thing and pretty much die in there now
typically<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.810> wouldn't<00:01:13.140> put<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
typically I wouldn't put one of these in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
typically I wouldn't put one of these in
because<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.460> tend<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> draw<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.299> beetles

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
because they tend to draw more beetles

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
because they tend to draw more beetles
in<00:01:15.869> than<00:01:16.080> anything<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> really<00:01:17.400> don't

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
in than anything so if you really don't

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.950 
in than anything so if you really don't
have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> beetle<00:01:18.030> problem<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.570> put<00:01:18.780> one<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
have a beetle problem and you put one of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.690 
have a beetle problem and you put one of
these<00:01:19.110> by<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.470> garden<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:19.890> something<00:01:19.920> your

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
these by your garden or something your

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.980 
these by your garden or something your
end<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.390> beetles<00:01:21.780> than

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
end up going to have more beetles than

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
end up going to have more beetles than
what<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.409> had<00:01:22.470> before<00:01:22.860> but

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
what you would have had before but

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
what you would have had before but
judging<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.110> showed<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
judging from what I just showed you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
judging from what I just showed you
right<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.729> bad<00:01:26.850> as

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
right there I think it's about as bad as

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
right there I think it's about as bad as
it's<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.619> try<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it's going to get so I'm going to try to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's going to get so I'm going to try to
put<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> chicken<00:01:29.909> coop<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
put this by the chicken coop here and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
put this by the chicken coop here and
lure<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.140> away<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.680> grapes<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.189> are

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
lure them away from my grapes which are

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
lure them away from my grapes which are
just<00:01:32.579> down<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:33.990> trees<00:01:34.259> are

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
just down that way and then my trees are

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
just down that way and then my trees are
right<00:01:34.530> across<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:34.920> me<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.939> hopefully

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
right across from me here so hopefully

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
right across from me here so hopefully
that<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.540> help<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.079> any<00:01:37.290> extra<00:01:37.680> ones

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that will help and then any extra ones

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
that will help and then any extra ones
maybe<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> chickens<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:39.000> partake<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
maybe the chickens can partake in so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.359 
maybe the chickens can partake in so
let's<00:01:40.320> put<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.560> thing<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.829> okay<00:01:41.280> these

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
let's put this thing up okay these

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.800 
let's put this thing up okay these
things<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.700> pretty<00:01:41.790> simple<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.180> install<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
things are pretty simple to install you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
things are pretty simple to install you
just<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.560> bait<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> lure

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just take the bait and you or the lure

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
just take the bait and you or the lure
and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> put<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.299> inside<00:01:45.689> these<00:01:45.960> slots

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and you put it down inside these slots

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
and you put it down inside these slots
that<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.759> basically

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that are on there and then basically

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
that are on there and then basically
they<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.140> fall<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.530> there

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
they go into that and they fall in there

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.499 
they go into that and they fall in there
and<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.829> can't<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.189> back<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.270> end

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and they can't get back out so you end

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.639 
and they can't get back out so you end
up<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.259> completely

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
up with this thing all it's completely

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.020 
up with this thing all it's completely
filled<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.890> beetles<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.759> gave<00:01:53.939> me

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
filled with beetles they gave me

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.789 
filled with beetles they gave me
directions<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.320> pretty

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
directions for all this but it's pretty

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
directions for all this but it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.909> put<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
self-explanatory I put this thing in the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
self-explanatory I put this thing in the
ground<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.640> upwards<00:02:00.060> from

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
ground right out here just upwards from

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
ground right out here just upwards from
the<00:02:00.630> trees<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.200> says<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.530> should<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.860> 10

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the trees it says you should be about 10

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
the trees it says you should be about 10
feet<00:02:02.340> away<00:02:02.460> from<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.479> stuff<00:02:03.689> you're<00:02:03.840> trying

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
feet away from the stuff you're trying

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
feet away from the stuff you're trying
to<00:02:04.110> protect<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.549> really<00:02:05.670> want<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> be

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to protect but I don't really want to be

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.100 
to protect but I don't really want to be
that<00:02:06.090> close<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.509> afraid<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.899> going<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that close I'm afraid it's going to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
that close I'm afraid it's going to
actually<00:02:07.229> lure<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.789> might<00:02:09.179> turn

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
actually lure more in so I might turn

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.089 
actually lure more in so I might turn
that<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> thing<00:02:10.229> facing<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
that to have that thing facing like that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.960 
that to have that thing facing like that
and<00:02:12.140> we're<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.739> get

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
and we're going to see what we get

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.540 
and we're going to see what we get
from<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.180> thing<00:02:14.830> these<00:02:15.830> things<00:02:15.890> must<00:02:16.280> work

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
from this thing these things must work

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.130 
from this thing these things must work
because<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.210> an<00:02:17.360> old<00:02:17.540> one<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.750> was<00:02:17.990> in

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
because this is an old one that was in

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.840 
because this is an old one that was in
there<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.500> there's<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> beetle<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.550> already

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
glorious I guess the only downside of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.010 
glorious I guess the only downside of
this<00:02:40.460> is<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.790> shows<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.300> suggest<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.720> number<00:02:41.930> of

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
this is it shows the suggest a number of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.600 
this is it shows the suggest a number of
traps<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.830> amount<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.130> size<00:02:43.310> of

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
traps and then the amount of size of

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.540 
traps and then the amount of size of
land<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.270> covers<00:02:45.250> basically<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
land that it covers basically for the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.100 
land that it covers basically for the
acreage<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.720> I'm<00:02:47.840> trying<00:02:48.050> to

without like walking through a bunch of
them<00:03:10.379> in<00:03:10.469> the<00:03:10.560> mornings<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.069> especially<00:03:11.370> bad

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
them in the mornings it's especially bad

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.339 
them in the mornings it's especially bad

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
the ground they're flying everywhere

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.170 
the ground they're flying everywhere
it's<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.959> plague<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.379> tell<00:03:16.560> ya<00:03:16.739> here<00:03:17.129> we<00:03:17.219> got<00:03:17.370> 100

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.970 

anyone<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.390> I'll<00:03:22.379> make<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:22.620> update<00:03:22.859> video

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
anyone in I'll make an update video

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.440 
anyone in I'll make an update video
showing<00:03:23.430> how<00:03:23.579> we<00:03:23.640> make<00:03:23.849> out<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.269> I've

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
showing how we make out with this I've

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.880 
showing how we make out with this I've
watched<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:24.930> ten<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.140> them<00:03:25.349> go<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.680> there

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
watched like ten of them go in there

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.440 
watched like ten of them go in there
just<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.280> few<00:03:26.400> minutes<00:03:26.700> since<00:03:26.849> I<00:03:26.970> put<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.299> up

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
just in a few minutes since I put it up

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.660 
just in a few minutes since I put it up
I'd<00:03:28.019> say<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.439> another<00:03:28.680> 2,000<00:03:29.310> more<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.579> we

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
I'd say like another 2,000 more and we

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.220 
I'd say like another 2,000 more and we
should<00:03:29.819> be<00:03:29.879> pretty<00:03:30.060> much<00:03:30.150> done<00:03:30.389> out<00:03:30.540> here<00:03:30.569> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
should be pretty much done out here the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.899 
should be pretty much done out here the
only<00:03:31.590> thing<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.129> I<00:03:32.159> think<00:03:32.340> will<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.819> a

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
only thing that I think will be a

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.330 
only thing that I think will be a
disadvantage<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.930> didn't<00:03:34.349> quite<00:03:34.560> put<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.889> 10

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
disadvantage is I didn't quite put it 10

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.550 
disadvantage is I didn't quite put it 10
feet<00:03:35.579> away<00:03:35.730> from<00:03:35.849> my<00:03:36.120> fruit<00:03:36.780> trees<00:03:37.049> but<00:03:37.349> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
feet away from my fruit trees but I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.099 
feet away from my fruit trees but I
really<00:03:37.980> don't<00:03:38.069> want<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.579> close<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.299> if<00:03:39.870> it

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
really don't want it that close if if it

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.199 
really don't want it that close if if it
does<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.439> fact<00:03:40.470> draw<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:41.069> more<00:03:41.310> beetles<00:03:41.909> so

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
does in fact draw in more beetles so

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.509 
does in fact draw in more beetles so
what<00:03:42.870> experiment<00:03:43.470> with<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> there<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.159> if<00:03:44.400> I

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
what experiment with it there and if I

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.890 
what experiment with it there and if I
need<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.760> put<00:03:44.879> it<00:03:45.000> closer<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.329> will<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:45.780> if<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
need to put it closer I will and if I

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.020 
need to put it closer I will and if I
need<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.169> get<00:03:46.260> more<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.500> will<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.129> as<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.939> can
