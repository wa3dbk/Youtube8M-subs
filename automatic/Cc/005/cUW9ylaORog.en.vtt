your<00:01:57.750> wings<00:01:57.899> level<00:01:58.110> again<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.679> round<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.039> the

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
your wings level again so round to the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.330 
your wings level again so round to the
right<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.719> pull<00:02:00.719> back<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.079> control<00:02:01.500> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
right and pull back on the control this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.309 
right and pull back on the control this
is<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.759> use<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.030> trim<00:02:03.390> again<00:02:03.689> so

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
is way we can use that trim again so

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.749 
is way we can use that trim again so
we're<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.530> fighting<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.429> can<00:02:05.549> start

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
we're not fighting it so you can start

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.050 
we're not fighting it so you can start
to<00:02:05.819> lower<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.270> nose<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.259> now

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
to lower the nose just a little bit now

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.020 
to lower the nose just a little bit now
takes<00:02:09.060> less<00:02:09.299> strain<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.869> us<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.349> well<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
takes less strain of us as well it's a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.080 
takes less strain of us as well it's a
lot<00:02:12.150> easier<00:02:12.209> now<00:02:13.280> ok<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> bit<00:02:14.849> hard<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
lot easier now ok now it's a bit hard to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.940 
lot easier now ok now it's a bit hard to
judge<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.260> way<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.470> puppy<00:02:16.799> right

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
judge with the the way the puppy right

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.620 
judge with the the way the puppy right
so<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.459> moment<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.510> right

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
so at the moment I'm just to the right

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.020 
so at the moment I'm just to the right
of<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.049> runway<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.310> way<00:02:20.459> till<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.849> bit

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
of this runway the way till we get a bit

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.990 
of this runway the way till we get a bit
closer<00:02:21.299> we'll<00:02:21.780> pull<00:02:22.019> back<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.380> control

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
closer we'll pull back on the control

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.550 
closer we'll pull back on the control
now<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.180> there's<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.510> height<00:02:24.750> above<00:02:24.930> sea<00:02:24.989> level

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
now so there's a height above sea level

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
now so there's a height above sea level
yeah<00:02:26.010> that's<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.610> high<00:02:26.730> drive<00:02:26.940> ground<00:02:27.269> level<00:02:27.569> so

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
yeah that's a high drive ground level so

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
yeah that's a high drive ground level so
rather<00:02:28.079> watch<00:02:28.349> them<00:02:28.530> enough<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:28.769> we<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.489> only

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
rather watch them enough so we have only

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.120 
rather watch them enough so we have only
be<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> thousand<00:02:30.480> feet<00:02:30.599> 100<00:02:31.230> feet<00:02:31.260> above<00:02:31.500> ground

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
be a thousand feet 100 feet above ground

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.400 
be a thousand feet 100 feet above ground
level<00:02:33.829> ok<00:02:35.480> nudge<00:02:36.480> around<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.959> right<00:02:37.110> just

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
level ok nudge around to the right just

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.670 
level ok nudge around to the right just
the<00:02:37.650> tiniest<00:02:37.890> bit<00:02:38.959> ok<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.140> lower<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.500> nose

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the tiniest bit ok and lower the nose

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.130 
the tiniest bit ok and lower the nose
about<00:02:40.980> half<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.459> centimeter<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.870> push<00:02:43.049> that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
about half a centimeter to push that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.240 
about half a centimeter to push that
nose<00:02:43.349> forward<00:02:43.560> about<00:02:43.799> half<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.099> centimeter

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
nose forward about half a centimeter

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.629 
nose forward about half a centimeter
I'll<00:02:44.970> do<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.390> nice<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:49.470> inputs<00:02:49.859> ok

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
I'll do so this is nice little inputs ok

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.069 
I'll do so this is nice little inputs ok
what<00:02:50.850> we're<00:02:50.970> going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.420> time<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.989> a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
what we're going to do this time is a

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.780 
what we're going to do this time is a
full<00:02:52.440> stop<00:02:52.680> landing<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.310> actually<00:02:53.430> want<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
full stop landing so we actually want to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.849 
full stop landing so we actually want to
slow<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> float<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.139> I<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.380> exactly

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
slow it up on the float so I be exactly

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.830 
slow it up on the float so I be exactly
what<00:02:56.069> we<00:02:56.160> did<00:02:56.280> last<00:02:56.340> time<00:02:56.790> when<00:02:57.359> I<00:02:57.389> tell<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.720> to

what we did last time when I tell you to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.289 
what we did last time when I tell you to
pull<00:02:58.350> us<00:02:58.500> back<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.829> idle<00:02:59.220> or<00:02:59.340> flare<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.120> and

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
pull us back to idle or flare that and

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.349 
pull us back to idle or flare that and
touchdown<00:03:00.780> we've<00:03:01.200> got<00:03:01.319> comedy<00:03:01.650> touchdown<00:03:02.370> we

in those just a little bit ok when we
touch<00:03:09.540> down<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.989> time<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.739> speed<00:03:11.069> brake<00:03:11.370> or

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
touch down this time this speed brake or

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.610 
touch down this time this speed brake or
spoiler<00:03:12.060> will<00:03:12.389> automatically<00:03:13.019> deploy<00:03:13.350> back

little bit a little bit more I sonos

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.720 
little bit a little bit more I sonos
actually<00:03:22.290> gets<00:03:22.440> pretty<00:03:22.739> high<00:03:22.889> on<00:03:23.190> final

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
actually gets pretty high on final

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.030 
actually gets pretty high on final
approach<00:03:23.790> ok<00:03:24.569> ok<00:03:25.049> there<00:03:25.410> we<00:03:25.500> go<00:03:25.530> see<00:03:25.889> all<00:03:26.010> right

hands on the control start the pullback

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.100 
hands on the control start the pullback
very<00:04:11.030> gently<00:04:12.340> ok<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.370> little<00:04:13.580> bit<00:04:13.730> more<00:04:13.910> now

very gently ok a little bit more now

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.190 
very gently ok a little bit more now
move<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.230> wall<00:04:16.060> then<00:04:17.060> start<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.840> lower<00:04:18.019> the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
move it wall then start to lower the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.610 
move it wall then start to lower the
nose<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.859> little<00:04:19.070> bit<00:04:19.190> oh<00:04:20.230> yeah<00:04:21.230> I<00:04:21.440> could

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
nose just a little bit oh yeah I could

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.530 
nose just a little bit oh yeah I could
have<00:04:21.709> been<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.829> bit<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.580> reverse<00:04:23.060> rice<00:04:23.300> when

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
have been a bit and reverse rice when

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.800 
have been a bit and reverse rice when
you<00:04:23.630> ready

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
you ready

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.930 
you ready
so<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.470> breaks<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.830> little<00:04:27.010> bit<00:04:27.280> sensitive<00:04:27.700> on

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
so it breaks a little bit sensitive on

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.850 
so it breaks a little bit sensitive on
learning<00:04:28.180> want<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.990> slide<00:04:29.230> over<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.680> place

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
learning want to slide over the place

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.920 
learning want to slide over the place
bit<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.850> first<00:04:31.090> trust<00:04:31.330> all<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.660> way<00:04:31.780> off

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
bit then the first trust all the way off

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.670 
bit then the first trust all the way off
so<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.370> all<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.639> way<00:04:33.730> forward

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
so just that is to all the way forward

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.000 
so just that is to all the way forward
