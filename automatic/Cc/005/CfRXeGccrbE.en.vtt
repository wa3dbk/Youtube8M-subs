00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
moment I thought Kakashi was gonna die

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.850 
moment I thought Kakashi was gonna die
in<00:04:39.240> his<00:04:39.420> chapter<00:04:39.630> on<00:04:39.900> my<00:04:39.960> oh<00:04:40.050> shit<00:04:40.440> his<00:04:40.650> coming

in his chapter on my oh shit his coming
is<00:04:41.070> coming<00:04:41.130> but<00:04:41.550> Norris<00:04:42.150> will<00:04:42.270> save<00:04:42.450> them<00:04:42.600> but

is coming but Norris will save them but

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.400 
is coming but Norris will save them but
other<00:04:43.440> than<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:45.390> fighting<00:04:45.810> wasn't

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
other than that if the fighting wasn't

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.110 
other than that if the fighting wasn't
in<00:04:46.530> this<00:04:46.680> chapter<00:04:46.950> like<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.430> brief<00:04:47.700> fighting

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
in this chapter like the brief fighting

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.270 
in this chapter like the brief fighting
wasn't<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.600> this<00:04:48.780> chapter<00:04:49.050> then<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.920> chapter

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
wasn't in this chapter then the chapter

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.360 
wasn't in this chapter then the chapter
probably<00:04:50.670> got<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.970> zero<00:04:51.270> honestly<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:52.320> mean<00:04:52.500> it

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
probably got the zero honestly I mean it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.700 
probably got the zero honestly I mean it
was<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:53.640> because<00:04:53.940> she<00:04:54.240> got<00:04:54.360> cut<00:04:54.600> up<00:04:54.710> Kakashi

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
was just because she got cut up Kakashi

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.980 
was just because she got cut up Kakashi
got<00:04:56.100> his<00:04:56.220> leg<00:04:56.400> Pierce<00:04:56.730> Kakashi<00:04:57.360> guy<00:04:57.570> needs<00:04:57.900> to

got his leg Pierce Kakashi guy needs to
the<00:04:58.080> face<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:58.440> think<00:04:58.650> that's<00:04:58.740> what<00:04:58.890> took<00:04:59.040> the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160
