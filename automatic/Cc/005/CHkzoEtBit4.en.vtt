00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello nice that she has turned on 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.429
 but for tv mobile for android 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 dvb-t-receiver for around 50 euros 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.740
 extraordinary at this part the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.210
 possibility of an external antenna 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.220
 to be able to connect as it is in the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.410
 Test has beaten her in the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.410
 next few minutes remains so turn 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 you open the otherwise unspectacular 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 packaging then comes a lot to 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.989
 the fore, of course, once the dvb 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.059
 t receiver to which we will soon be 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.710
 come the so-called external antenna 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 as I mentioned here with the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.800
 both extendable temples 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.780
 then we have still a sucker 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 fixed so long but smooth surfaces 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.809
 even a pinch around her 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 example to clamp on the wall somewhere 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.170
 or a curtain the adapter for the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.760
 external antenna and the usual 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 rod antenna like you get from others 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.840
 of course knows products is there in course 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 well-served areas completely 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.469
 sufficient if it is a little worse 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.660
 is supplied then you just take each 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.789
 external connection and then it works 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.220
 also very good 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.010
 Let's take a look at the very small dvb t 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.119
 receivers of avertv and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.680
 differs now visually 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.450
 probably not from other products 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.740
 how pondering cd comes to the whole 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.750
 them black, therefore 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.549
 and here on the back bad youngest 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.770
 connection either for the rod antenna 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.390
 I have already shown you that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 that's just enough in inner cities 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.000
 or via external adapter and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 antenna just like that and so you can 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 A commercial antenna like you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.159
 synonymous of tv devices ago knows 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.590
 connect 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.409
 that will look on my samsung galaxy 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.450
 note something like this you can already see here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.610
 the connection is relatively shaky so 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.229
 a little bit but she is absolutely stable 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.119
 have the black device and of course 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.759
 clear with black smartphones 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.250
 better what do you need than 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.780
 minimum requirement android 4 0 3 and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.329
 most importantly, dual core 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 cpu and he also needs a so-called 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.759
 usb otg support otherwise you can 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.090
 you do not have a live tv with this adapter 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.340
 receive the mandatory for the operation 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 necessary software from but media can 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.789
 Get her for free from the google place gate 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.770
 install download 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.640
 and as I said from android 4 0 3 runs 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 then you too 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.030
 after you search the channel first 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.250
 has not finished getting her a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 number of programs over dvb-t 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.380
 Receivable are here with me on the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.390
 village are at least 25 with it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.980
 private and public law 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 stations in MÃ¼nster's city are currently only 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.660
 twelve public law and in the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.430
 City with us are even about 35 so ever 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.040
 by area you get more or 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 I want fewer stations in the gallery 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.620
 for example, all recorded 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.760
 find programs that's me 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.069
 can the running operation then 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.080
 of course also record and via epg 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.480
 you already know the electronic 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.420
 program guide you can see what 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.320
 Currently watching TV is running here 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.390
 but in a very 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.860
 confusing way that 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.209
 makes in my eyes do not see much 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.070
 on the big display 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.360
 I have already clearer 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.760
 seen as eps 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.800
 the tv reception is okay 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.940
 just about the external antenna too 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.580
 here with me on the village where it 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.019
 usually neatly twitching in the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.280
 downtown is of course still reception 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.230
 better so I then on the small one 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.760
 rod antenna could change if I 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.200
 I wanted to find that but personally 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.430
 Much better the pak in the bag 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.079
 and so can i, for example 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.420
 already two and a half in the morning at the station 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.130
 men and similar look in the train 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.260
 Of course, the reception fluctuated 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.980
 very strong most of the time you do not have that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.180
 But then it is synonymous s.der 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.709
 speed and a changing 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.350
 I have that in my reception area 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.660
 car for example my car tv though 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.190
 also not program change relative 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.810
 just simply from left to right 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.430
 wipe and you have that 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.299
 corresponding channel changed the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.160
 Of course it takes one now 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.170
 corresponding time until it switches 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.130
 unfortunately can not be prevented 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.930
 at home at dvb-t usually too 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.269
 who wants to see the menu now 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.959
 just double tap on the screen 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.519
 the agency 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.840
 then you get an overview here 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.310
 For example , I can do foot screen 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.360
 have now the sound on quietly can with 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.220
 over the red button but also 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.720
 easily record in the background 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.459
 if I just want one too 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.769
 screenshot and here about the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.030
 have symbol with the respective gears 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.400
 I the possibility of the soundtrack too 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.170
 change subtitles or the video 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.870
 decoder that means there is either 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.000
 software or a hardware decoder 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.190
 this is how it works, for example 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.320
 what i have recorded i take 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.030
 here 21 seconds of television the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.919
 can play back without problems if 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.780
 I want that but that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.090
 of course only works if the app 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.470
 also runs and that's why she turns in 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 mainz 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.500
 not quite as much sense now 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.800
 because you have what scenes you like her 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.570
 someone else would like to show for 50 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.900
 euro you get the two eyes one 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.730
 very good dvb t receiver from ava media 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.260
 Of course, the smartphone must be usb 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.120
 support that is in others but 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.040
 not everything was different for me 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.630
 personally liked it very much 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.780
 external antenna which I also in 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.730
 poorly supplied areas still with 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.010
 correspondingly much dvb t programs 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.200
 the whole of good is supplied 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.270
 quality with record options 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.610
 all you need really not who 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.830
 a lot is on the way or is standing around 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.380
 will appreciate that very quickly 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.970
 In my opinion, this is part of everyone 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.850
 worth his money 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.620
 yes i hope that little review has you 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.780
 If it should be like that 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.060
 Of course, I'm happy about yours 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.280
 thumbs up otherwise I say as always 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.280
 Do it well and see you in the day
