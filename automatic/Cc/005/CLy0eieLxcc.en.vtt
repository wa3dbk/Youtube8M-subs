00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
at the wall controller adapter at the I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.080 
at the wall controller adapter at the I
had<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.210> put<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:20.420> down<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:25.670> controller

had to put this down this controller

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.040 
had to put this down this controller
adapter<00:01:27.280> lets<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.430> use<00:01:30.820> your<00:01:31.820> old<00:01:32.050> GameCube

adapter lets you use your old GameCube

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.230 
adapter lets you use your old GameCube
controllers<00:01:33.619> on<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.190> we<00:01:34.610> or<00:01:34.820> your<00:01:34.970> Wii<00:01:35.119> U

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
controllers on your we or your Wii U

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.770 
controllers on your we or your Wii U
system<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:36.670> think<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:37.970> special<00:01:38.690> made

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
system I think this is a special made

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.219 
system I think this is a special made
for<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> Wii<00:01:39.259> U<00:01:39.290> in<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.770> later<00:01:40.220> model<00:01:40.670> these

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
for the Wii U in the later model these

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.410 
for the Wii U in the later model these
because<00:01:42.229> they<00:01:42.619> don't<00:01:42.800> have<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.420> GameCube

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
because they don't have a GameCube

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.760 
because they don't have a GameCube
controller<00:01:44.810> ports<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.660> if<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.170> want<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.649> use

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
controller ports so if you want to use

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.920 
controller ports so if you want to use
this<00:01:48.920> for<00:01:49.130> like<00:01:49.479> Smash<00:01:50.479> Bros<00:01:50.840> Brawl<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:53.780> the
