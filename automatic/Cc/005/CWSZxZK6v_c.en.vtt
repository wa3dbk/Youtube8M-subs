00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.070
 Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 We are busy with reorganizing our office here, and in the meantime 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.519
 I have come across many things from my past, such as, uh, this old picture of me 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.190
 Good news, little me. You get rid of your braces! Six years from now. 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.920
 I also found this slightly more recent picture of myself. I don't know if it's a picture or not, 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.240
 but it is certainly realistic. 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.320
 And from 2006, my favorite fan mail ever, "in response to The Great Maybe I can be honest 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.539
 say that after I put down your book, I felt something that I had never felt before. It was 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.970
 no nausea, as if I had to vomit or something, or a feeling as if I had to poop 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.020
 or the like. But I felt something. " 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.370
 I really felt something through your book. Not the two most important things I feel: the urge to defecate 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.270
 and to surrender, but something new. 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.000
 And Hank, I also found my old reports all the way from 1994. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.430
 This is from my penultimate high school year, Hank. I had a C for Latin, "John's numbers 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.160
 for this course have gone down steeply in the last 6 weeks. He missed and was too many lessons 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.960
 rarely prepared for the daily lesson. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.390
 Oh well, that's Latin; it's a dead language. This one is mine, uh, French - I had a B before 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.570
 French, I don't want to brag. "Without a doubt, John could have done much better this year." Hm. 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.600
 American history, I got a B, "John managed to come to class a little more often during the last one 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.700
 trimester, and his grade went up - a little. "You had to," a little 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.600
 could end with my figure getting higher. It is technically true. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.330
 I had a C for mathematics, which to be honest was probably very generous. For chemistry, a C. And for 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.820
 English I had a, uh, C, "He could be a good English student, but he's about to 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.230
 arrived where he just can't make it anymore. " 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.400
 Hank, I don't often talk about what a bad student I was at school. I think partly because 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.630
 I'm still ashamed of it, 20 years later. I have indeed missed many lessons, 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 because they were early or something, or because they did not match my plans for cigarettes 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.640
 to smoke in the woods. 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 But even when I was in class, I was still quite a bad student. 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.550
 Hank, you know how to become the third-best C student in the entire state of Alabama 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.830
 academic decathlon? First you get terrible grades so that you are not an A or B student. 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.350
 And that's who I was in high school. I performed below my level, I skipped school, I did 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 never my homework, I was never prepared for class, I was always behind and I was stressed. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.510
 In the meantime, you, Hank, got great grades, you didn't smoke, and then you got a scholarship 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.729
 for the university and everything. 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.990
 Anyway, Hank, finding these reports reminded me of a number of things. The first is 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.720
 that I have been very lucky. I not only got a second chance - I got hundreds 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.300
 opportunities. And even though I was a very bad student, I always had great teachers 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.760
 kept believing in me, even though I gave them no reason for this. 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.590
 The other thing I thought of, Hank, was this: High School 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.700
 is not your destiny. It's a part of life, but I think when you go to school, everyone does 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.730
 as if it is the most important thing you will ever do, and that throughout your life 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.010
 it is determined. 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.959
 But as far as I know, the rest of your life is not determined at all. Never. 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.709
 Usually it is not that there is one split in the road, and that you have one or the other 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.300
 choose away. There are hundreds of splits in the way every day of your life. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.580
 The university is also not your destiny. To be clear, I was a much better student at the university than I was 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.599
 was in high school. 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.250
 But even when you are twenty, your future is not certain! And when you're thirty either! Your future 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.670
 is not determined in one go. It is something that only happens when you look back. 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.130
 Hank, when I was in high school, I thought I was just a kind of failure. You know? 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.489
 But ultimately, Hank, people are not just one thing. I was a failure, but I was good too 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.380
 a good reader. 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.370
 And now that I read those reports back, I want to thank my teachers for the fact that they knew that 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.660
 I wasn't a failure - even when I didn't know myself. 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.030
 Hank, I'll see you on Friday.
