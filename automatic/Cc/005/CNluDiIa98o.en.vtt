stations<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.380> use<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> Necromorph<00:00:11.639> system<00:00:12.000> to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
stations I use a Necromorph system to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.580 
stations I use a Necromorph system to
activate<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> sticky<00:00:12.929> piston<00:00:13.139> which

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
activate a sticky piston which

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.320 
activate a sticky piston which
interrupts<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> elevator<00:00:14.639> circuit<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
second floor activates the sticky piston

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.070 
second floor activates the sticky piston
here<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:28.710> above<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.340> floor

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
here this is right above the first floor

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.389 
here this is right above the first floor
because<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.109> sticky<00:00:31.500> piston<00:00:31.859> pushes<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
because the sticky piston pushes this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.180 
because the sticky piston pushes this
