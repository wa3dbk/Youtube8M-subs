00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.759
 that if they went for us to the people 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.000
 that we are nothing to say that 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.740
 it really hurts them hurts that 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.049
 we got into the system because the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.300
 system is rotten and then possible 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.140
 you have to go ahead and follow the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.359
 talk combines pure repression expresses 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.419
 by the forces and bodies of 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.140
 security the state of the judiciary 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:34.329
 of the penitentiary institutions with 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.710
 the mechanisms to isolate the dissident 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.140
 mechanisms that have been based mostly 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.370
 in the control of the means of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.370
 official communication 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.490
 now that the repression is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.260
 extending that you do not have to 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.120
 accused of being the environment or eta 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.130
 I put them to get you in prison and every 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.290
 there will be more political prisoners 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.000
 simply by going to a protest in 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.280
 the street because people are giving 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.770
 mind that the transition was a rip-off 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.760
 that served to perpetuate in power to 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.730
 the same ones and they made four reforms 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.190
 and that the very few liberties that 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.220
 they had to give in so that later 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.470
 will explode a maybe a revolution or 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.330
 certainly stronger bursts for 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.280
 contain the working class in this 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.810
 state they chase you just for being 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 communists and what happened to us 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.210
 we can happen to any 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.750
 person and against this kind of thing and the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 People do not people do not think like that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.079
 do not 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.880
 it is not believed that they were Spanish parties 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.880
 because until they do not touch them 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.610
 it is not do not give more importance 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.040
 basic pillar they have all the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.570
 weapons to repress us and we 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.400
 only that we have the ordinary 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.860
 extend solidarity have to 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.480
 coordinate has to reach all the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.480
 corners where there are cases of repressions 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.310
 It is very important to organize the 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.310
 solidarity for his people 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
 and the increase in depression what 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.910
 it means there is a greater increase of 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.070
 consciousness but what is needed 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.490
 it is a greater increase of the organization 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.560
 repression does not care about conscience 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.110
 the repression does not even care 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.360
 the fight like that understood in a way is 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.350
 so much the repression to the other reason to focus 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.110
 this 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.240
 the organization and all the power 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.970
 depressive of the state what you are looking for is 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.560
 prevent movement organization 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.820
 of resistance 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.350
 in the head my way of thinking is something that 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.400
 for many years that they had put me 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.400
 the jail do not think that
