band<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.320> looking<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
band and what you're looking at is the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.089 
band and what you're looking at is the
entire<00:00:29.640> band<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> there's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
entire band and you can see that there's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.100 
entire band and you can see that there's
all<00:00:32.279> kinds<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> Wi-Fi<00:00:33.000> signal<00:00:33.420> signals<00:00:33.930> going

what<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.110> does<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.860> lets<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.329> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
what this does is it lets you see the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
what this does is it lets you see the
signals<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> frequencies<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
signals but you see the frequencies in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
signals but you see the frequencies in
there<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> their<00:00:50.760> amplitude<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.660> has

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
there and their amplitude so it also has

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.420 
there and their amplitude so it also has
you<00:00:52.199> push<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.739> plus<00:00:52.920> button<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you push this little plus button on the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.240 
you push this little plus button on the
top<00:00:53.809> what<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.170> now<00:00:55.410> let<00:00:55.680> me<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.070> can

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
top what you see now let me see if I can

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
top what you see now let me see if I can
zoom<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.780> see

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
zoom in on that there it is you can see

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.990 
zoom in on that there it is you can see
those<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.010> bands<00:00:59.399> there's<00:00:59.550> 13<00:00:59.969> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
those are the Wi-Fi bands there's 13 of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.920 
those are the Wi-Fi bands there's 13 of
them<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.410> zoom<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.010> any<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.930> or

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
them and you can zoom in on any one or

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
them and you can zoom in on any one or
highlight<00:01:04.350> any<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:06.170> there's<00:01:07.170> channel<00:01:07.560> 6<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
highlight any one there's channel 6 the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
highlight any one there's channel 6 the
others<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.030> still<00:01:09.240> visible<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
others are still visible but what this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.289 
others are still visible but what this
does<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.310> lets<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> zoom<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
does is that lets you zoom in on a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
does is that lets you zoom in on a
particular<00:01:12.510> Channel<00:01:13.320> channel<00:01:14.159> 6<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.760> I'm

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
particular Channel channel 6 is what I'm

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.550 
particular Channel channel 6 is what I'm
using<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.720> why<00:01:15.900> you're<00:01:16.110> seeing<00:01:16.140> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
using so that's why you're seeing so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
using so that's why you're seeing so
many<00:01:16.680> signals<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:18.330> unit<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> also<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:21.020> power

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
many signals the unit is also a power

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
many signals the unit is also a power
meter<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.509> hit<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.580> switch<00:01:26.580> 2<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
meter and if I hit the switch 2 and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440 
meter and if I hit the switch 2 and
power<00:01:27.720> button<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:29.400> power<00:01:29.729> meter<00:01:29.970> comes<00:01:30.270> up

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
power button now a power meter comes up

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
power button now a power meter comes up
and<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.619> detecting<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.310> not

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and it's not detecting and not

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
and it's not detecting and not
triggering<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.970> anything<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> moment<00:01:36.990> but

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
triggering on anything at the moment but

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.920 
triggering on anything at the moment but
it<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.850> we'll<00:01:39.060> give<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.360> few<00:01:39.390> seconds

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it will and we'll give it a few seconds

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.039 
it will and we'll give it a few seconds
and<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.140> should<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.560> something<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and we should see something and there it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:46.630 
and we should see something and there it
is

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
is

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
is
alright<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.909> let's<00:01:48.119> flip<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
alright so let's flip back to the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.420 
alright so let's flip back to the
spectrum<00:01:49.829> analyzer<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.439> has<00:01:52.649> quite<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
spectrum analyzer and this has quite a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.130 
spectrum analyzer and this has quite a
few<00:01:53.640> settings<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.210> lets<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.930> was

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
few settings it lets you see it was

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
few settings it lets you see it was
we're<00:01:55.770> using<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.189> real<00:01:56.460> wave<00:01:56.759> mode<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.270> also

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
we're using it in real wave mode it also

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.499 
we're using it in real wave mode it also
works<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> waterfall<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.909> also<00:02:00.119> do

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
works as a waterfall it can also do

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.580 
works as a waterfall it can also do
things<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.869> averaging<00:02:02.450> decays<00:02:03.530> allow<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
things like averaging decays allow you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.359 
things like averaging decays allow you
to<00:02:04.799> hold<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> signals<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.860> capture<00:02:07.860> peak<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to hold the signals to capture peak and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.469 
to hold the signals to capture peak and
minimum

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
minimum

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.970 
minimum
amplitudes<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:14.290> quite<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.590> useful

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
amplitudes and it's quite a useful

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.430 
amplitudes and it's quite a useful
