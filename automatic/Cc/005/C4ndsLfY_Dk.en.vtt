00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.610
 on the 18th day of gas fighting on the ground and with 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.709
 of air 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.900
 when according to the management of tsahala 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.490
 Hamas terrorists' morale drops 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.740
 peaked and pressure on israel 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.169
 primarily from the us 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.010
 I think the white house is concerned yet not 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.710
 the fate of hamas 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.990
 and the number of people who died in Gaza, even though 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.180
 many times it was said and argued 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.430
 there are no armies that are so eager 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.590
 save civilians sometimes 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.220
 fights themselves almost in whites 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.280
 gloved hands 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.500
 otherwise the number of gas killed would not be 800 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.960
 half of them are action movies ten times 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.890
 more for will be the 7th always of the reasons 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.260
 blame israel 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.780
 Wow bones, too, blamed for this this 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.019
 tradition is the order of things so leads 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.420
 myself peacefully Lena residents of those areas 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.480
 which operation is being conducted they were 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.309
 warned unfortunately hamas very 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.350
 many of them made up and stay their own 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.449
 homes point command posts not 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.789
 are in residential buildings by soldiers 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.979
 we shoot houses from time to time 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.899
 we find launchers and 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.469
 territories of schools and kindergartens and 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.630
 hospitals 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.700
 this is not fiction Hamas does not allow 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.890
 sick and wounded come to the field 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.200
 hospital which israelis specifically 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 deployed at the border for victims 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.010
 residents of gases 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.440
 Hamas sheep prepare protracted conflict 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.230
 began to take care of rocket reducing three 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.270
 the intensity of the attacks of Israel losing 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.090
 force they seek to open a second front 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.520
 and raises arabs jews and samaria 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.840
 on the third intifada mass 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.620
 clashes with shootouts 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.650
 checkpoints 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.660
 six Palestinians have already been killed 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.710
 not completed and the work of the IDF 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.260
 destroy the tun and 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.300
 found another leading from the mosque in 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.850
 gas straight to the Israeli kibbutz 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.590
 there is enough work for the engineering troops 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.780
 not less than 2 weeks 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.820

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.350
 now would be to give hamas 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.910
 and moral victory but the main people 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.000
