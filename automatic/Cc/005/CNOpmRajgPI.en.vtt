different types and manufacturers of
these<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.090> they're<00:01:24.630> basically<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.700> valve

and it provides a check valve it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280 
and it provides a check valve it
provides<00:01:32.340> protection<00:01:32.869> for<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:33.960> water

know insect spray or something and
there's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> potential<00:01:47.850> where<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> water<00:01:48.270> can

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
there's a potential where that water can

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
there's a potential where that water can
get<00:01:48.659> sucked<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.049> into<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.500> well<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
get sucked back into your well but the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.840 
get sucked back into your well but the
backflow<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.439> backflow<00:01:53.009> prevention<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
backflow the the backflow prevention you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
backflow the the backflow prevention you
and<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.030> prevents<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> long<00:01:56.610> story<00:01:56.850> short

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and it prevents that so long story short

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
and it prevents that so long story short

how it kind of kind of flows inward here

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.180 
how it kind of kind of flows inward here
you<00:04:21.419> also<00:04:21.570> want<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.870> be<00:04:21.960> sure<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.590> width

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you also want to be sure that the width

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.830 
you also want to be sure that the width
there's<00:04:23.490> gonna<00:04:23.610> be<00:04:23.700> enough<00:04:24.030> whiffs<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.660> want

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
there's gonna be enough whiffs you want

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.300 
there's gonna be enough whiffs you want
to<00:04:24.930> measure<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.260> actual<00:04:25.770> backflow<00:04:26.280> device

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
to measure that actual backflow device

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.370 
to measure that actual backflow device
that's<00:04:27.120> usually<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.570> widest<00:04:27.960> part<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
that's usually the widest part of the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.280 
that's usually the widest part of the
whole<00:04:28.560> unit<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.100> make<00:04:29.610> sure<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.810> this

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
whole unit and make sure that that this

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.560 
whole unit and make sure that that this
is<00:04:31.410> gonna<00:04:31.560> be<00:04:31.740> wide<00:04:32.010> enough<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.670> it's<00:04:33.510> a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
is gonna be wide enough for that it's a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.480 
is gonna be wide enough for that it's a
real<00:04:33.780> popular<00:04:34.050> mistake<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.800> people<00:04:34.950> forget

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
real popular mistake that people forget

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.970 
real popular mistake that people forget
and<00:04:35.640> they<00:04:36.480> end<00:04:36.660> up<00:04:36.840> with<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:37.050> cover<00:04:37.320> that's<00:04:37.560> too

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
and they end up with a cover that's too

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.800 
and they end up with a cover that's too
small<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.670> that's<00:04:39.330> never<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.720> good<00:04:40.140> thing<00:04:40.220> so

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
small and that's never a good thing so

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.010 
small and that's never a good thing so
be<00:04:42.810> sure<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.990> measure<00:04:43.230> carefully<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:45.390> just

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
be sure to measure carefully I just

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.910 
be sure to measure carefully I just
wanted<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:46.410> show<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.760> here<00:04:48.110> see<00:04:49.110> if<00:04:49.290> I<00:04:49.470> have<00:04:49.890> a

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
wanted to show you here see if I have a

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.580 
wanted to show you here see if I have a
better<00:04:50.610> photo<00:04:51.090> look<00:04:51.630> at<00:04:51.720> this<00:04:51.960> one<00:04:52.200> quickly

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
better photo look at this one quickly

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.690 
better photo look at this one quickly
these<00:04:53.400> have<00:04:53.700> their<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.750> two-piece<00:04:55.140> design

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
these have their it's a two-piece design

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.420 
these have their it's a two-piece design
so<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:56.880> base<00:04:57.180> piece<00:04:57.540> here<00:04:58.010> would<00:04:59.010> go<00:04:59.190> down

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
so this base piece here would go down

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.270 
so this base piece here would go down
first<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.240> then<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.810> cover<00:05:01.110> would<00:05:01.800> lift<00:05:02.070> on

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
first and then the cover would lift on

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.960 
first and then the cover would lift on
onto<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.120> there's<00:05:03.900> filter<00:05:04.830> media<00:05:05.220> here<00:05:05.610> for

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
onto it there's filter media here for

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.000 
onto it there's filter media here for
airflow<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.720> also<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.290> water<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.890> escape

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
airflow and also so water can escape

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.310 
airflow and also so water can escape
there's<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:09.530> dual<00:05:10.530> locking<00:05:11.090> padlock<00:05:12.090> tabs<00:05:12.510> so

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
there's a dual locking padlock tabs so

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.200 
there's a dual locking padlock tabs so
you<00:05:13.380> can<00:05:13.590> throw<00:05:13.800> locks<00:05:14.130> on<00:05:14.430> these<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.880> keep<00:05:15.060> you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
you can throw locks on these to keep you

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.050 
you can throw locks on these to keep you
secure<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.960> also<00:05:16.950> here<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:17.430> can<00:05:17.580> see<00:05:17.820> where

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
secure and also here you can see where

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.450 
secure and also here you can see where
you<00:05:18.510> can<00:05:18.660> stake<00:05:19.080> this<00:05:19.320> into<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.710> ground<00:05:19.950> or

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
you can stake this into the ground or

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.820 
you can stake this into the ground or
screw<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:20.910> into<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.120> concrete<00:05:21.390> slab<00:05:21.900> or

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
screw it into a concrete slab or

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.220 
screw it into a concrete slab or
something<00:05:23.220> along<00:05:23.430> those<00:05:23.640> lines<00:05:24.000> so<00:05:24.870> these<00:05:25.020> are

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
something along those lines so these are

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.440 
something along those lines so these are
they're<00:05:25.560> very<00:05:25.770> versatile<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:27.150> know<00:05:27.270> they've

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
they're very versatile you know they've

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.180 
they're very versatile you know they've
got<00:05:27.480> all<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.990> bells<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.380> whistles<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:29.040> like

aggregated look it's got a real nice
finish<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.760> its<00:06:17.880> really<00:06:18.210> this<00:06:18.630> is<00:06:18.810> real

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
finish to it and its really this is real

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.750 
finish to it and its really this is real
thick<00:06:19.260> and<00:06:19.470> durable<00:06:20.150> it's<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.260> real<00:06:22.260> quality

as<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.809> said<00:06:26.019> before<00:06:26.169> they<00:06:26.559> really<00:06:27.099> kind<00:06:27.249> of

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:27.369 
as I said before they really kind of

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.039 
as I said before they really kind of
blend<00:06:27.669> in<00:06:27.849> well<00:06:28.029> with<00:06:28.479> the<00:06:28.539> with<00:06:28.929> the

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:29.049 
blend in well with the with the

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:32.789 
blend in well with the with the
surroundings<00:06:29.709> and<00:06:30.009> and<00:06:30.549> look<00:06:30.819> nice<00:06:31.089> so<00:06:31.679> if<00:06:32.679> you

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:32.799 
surroundings and and look nice so if you
