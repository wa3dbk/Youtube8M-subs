show<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.240> how<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:36.520> kill<00:01:37.520> system<00:01:37.909> works

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
show you how the kill system works

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.649 
show you how the kill system works
there's<00:01:39.740> an<00:01:39.979> ultra-secure<00:01:40.700> four-digit<00:01:41.509> code

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
there's an ultra-secure four-digit code

now you can see six buttons here the two
extra<00:01:44.090> buttons<00:01:44.479> are<00:01:44.600> reset<00:01:45.020> button<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:45.530> if

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
extra buttons are reset button so if

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.050 
extra buttons are reset button so if
someone<00:01:45.830> ever<00:01:46.009> tried<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.429> come<00:01:46.549> up<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.850> steal

long<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.729> punching<00:01:50.240> buttons<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.920> bike

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
long and punching buttons and the bike

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.419 
long and punching buttons and the bike
will<00:01:52.310> never<00:01:52.490> start<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:54.530> designed<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.399> way

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
will never start it's designed that way

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.359 
will never start it's designed that way

your<00:02:00.950> off<00:02:01.069> button<00:02:01.429> so<00:02:01.700> i<00:02:02.479> put<00:02:02.899> in<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.110> very

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
your off button so i put in a very

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.240 
your off button so i put in a very
simple<00:02:03.649> code<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.399> for<00:02:04.640> demonstration<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:07.220> i

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
simple code just for demonstration so i

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.620 
simple code just for demonstration so i
don't<00:02:07.520> screw<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:07.850> up<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.269> know<00:02:08.390> i<00:02:08.420> know<00:02:08.539> i

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
don't screw it up you know i know i

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.500 
don't screw it up you know i know i
can't<00:02:09.080> remember<00:02:09.200> all<00:02:09.560> these<00:02:09.709> codes<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.670> punch

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
can't remember all these codes so punch

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.190 
can't remember all these codes so punch
in<00:02:11.630> your<00:02:11.660> code<00:02:13.720> you'll<00:02:14.720> hear<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.959> fuel<00:02:15.110> pump
