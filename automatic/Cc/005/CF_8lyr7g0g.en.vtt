00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
in one business ones to visitors three

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.380 
in one business ones to visitors three
versus<00:02:56.130> three<00:02:56.160> fathers<00:02:56.580> wat<00:02:56.940> suppose<00:02:57.210> can

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
versus three fathers wat suppose can

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.900 
versus three fathers wat suppose can
also<00:02:57.540> work<00:02:57.750> though<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.020> might<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.200> less<00:02:59.070> strong

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
also work though it might be less strong

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.490 
also work though it might be less strong
there<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.180> course<00:03:00.330> it's<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.600> lot<00:03:00.720> those<00:03:00.900> tends

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
there of course it's a lot those tends

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
there of course it's a lot those tends
to<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> lot<00:03:01.860> more<00:03:01.920> about<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.310> greater

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
to be a lot more about the greater

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.190 
to be a lot more about the greater
number<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:02.910> players<00:03:03.240> so<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> bit<00:03:03.810> trickier

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
number of players so it's a bit trickier

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.050 
number of players so it's a bit trickier
but<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.800> but<00:03:05.400> overall<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.820> mean

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
but I can do it but overall I mean

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.610 
but I can do it but overall I mean
there's<00:03:06.270> no<00:03:06.450> real<00:03:06.720> restrictions<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> doesn't

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
there's no real restrictions it doesn't

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.260 
there's no real restrictions it doesn't
have<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:07.830> an<00:03:07.920> exciting<00:03:08.190> fight<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.880> know<00:03:09.060> I

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
has to be one missile feel like you know

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.780 
has to be one missile feel like you know
there<00:03:16.440> might<00:03:16.620> be<00:03:16.680> something<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.280> could<00:03:17.340> can

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
there might be something I could can

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.080 
there might be something I could can
improve<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.459> be<00:03:20.580> as<00:03:20.670> short<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:20.970> you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
improve on it can be as short as you

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.270 
improve on it can be as short as you
want<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.570> be<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> swell<00:03:22.200> one<00:03:22.830> hour<00:03:23.010> still<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
want it can be a swell one hour still I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.090 
want it can be a swell one hour still I
think<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.670> bit<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.000> max<00:03:24.209> there<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.510> mean<00:03:24.780> a

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
think it's a bit of a max there I mean a

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.180 
think it's a bit of a max there I mean a
bit<00:03:26.100> longer<00:03:26.310> than<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:27.120> know<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:28.020> bit<00:03:28.830> this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
bit longer than that I know so bit this

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.970 
bit longer than that I know so bit this
will<00:03:29.490> keep<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.850> mind<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:31.020> all<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.500> talk

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.710 
the details of the wealth economic
transfer<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.550> get<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.030> work<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.600> then

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
transfer and then I get to work and then

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.300 
transfer and then I get to work and then
I<00:03:54.989> should<00:03:55.590> hopefully<00:03:55.769> as<00:03:55.980> quickly<00:03:56.190> as

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
I should hopefully as quickly as

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.590 
I should hopefully as quickly as
possible<00:03:56.610> then<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> response<00:03:57.390> back<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.840> you

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
possible then get a response back to you

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.310 
possible then get a response back to you
so<00:04:00.600> that's<00:04:00.930> generally<00:04:01.860> how<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.330> imagined<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.480> of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
so that's generally how I imagined it of

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.470 
so that's generally how I imagined it of
course<00:04:04.590> it'll<00:04:04.709> be<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.830> bit<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.130> first<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.580> me<00:04:05.700> so

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
course it'll be a bit of first for me so

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.729 
course it'll be a bit of first for me so
of<00:04:06.540> course<00:04:06.600> there<00:04:06.900> might<00:04:07.019> be<00:04:07.080> some<00:04:07.380> issues

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
of course there might be some issues

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.350 
of course there might be some issues
hiccups<00:04:08.280> for<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> course<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.790> again<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.239> why

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
hiccups for the course that again is why

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.570 
hiccups for the course that again is why
we<00:04:09.540> sort<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.780> agree<00:04:10.170> initially<00:04:10.650> upon<00:04:10.920> things

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
we sort of agree initially upon things

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.340 
we sort of agree initially upon things
before<00:04:12.030> actually<00:04:12.390> getting<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:15.350> but

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
before actually getting to it but
