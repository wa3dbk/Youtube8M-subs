00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the Hindi film industry is quite a good

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
the Hindi film industry is quite a good
place<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.540> women<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.899> work<00:01:43.020> which<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> why<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
place for women to work which is why you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
place for women to work which is why you
have<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.490> many<00:01:44.640> women<00:01:44.850> coming<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.630> know

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
not just in terms of Directors you have

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
not just in terms of Directors you have
producers<00:01:48.299> your<00:01:48.540> writers<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.200> have

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320

host of people coming into a women and I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.819 
host of people coming into a women and I
think<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:54.659> by<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> large

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
think that's because by and large

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
think that's because by and large
compared<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> rest<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> country

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
compared to the rest of the country

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.200 
compared to the rest of the country

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.160 
know I honestly again like I'm saying
I've<00:02:21.820> never<00:02:21.850> really<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.660> had<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> problem

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
I've never really really had a problem

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.730

and<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.060> few<00:02:25.300> times<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:26.110> mean<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
and you know the few times I mean the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.410 
and you know the few times I mean the
only<00:02:26.890> time<00:02:27.160> somebody<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.790> wouldn't<00:02:28.000> say<00:02:28.209> was

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
know all that you know I think though I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.550 
know all that you know I think though I
wouldn't<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.540> admit<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.200> think<00:03:02.410> there

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
wouldn't like to admit it I think there

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.500 
wouldn't like to admit it I think there
is<00:03:02.709> some<00:03:02.950> truth<00:03:03.190> in<00:03:03.340> what<00:03:03.489> you're<00:03:03.700> saying<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.150> do

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
is some truth in what you're saying I do

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.050 
is some truth in what you're saying I do
believe<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:06.160> am<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> lot<00:03:06.640> more<00:03:06.700> aggressive

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
believe I am a lot more aggressive

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.880 
believe I am a lot more aggressive
probably<00:03:07.840> because<00:03:08.170> I'm<00:03:08.320> trying<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.560> assert

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
probably because I'm trying to assert

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.080 
probably because I'm trying to assert
myself<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:10.410> male-dominated<00:03:11.850> or<00:03:12.850> maybe

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
myself in this male-dominated or maybe

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.180 
myself in this male-dominated or maybe
there's<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:13.420> an<00:03:13.690> excuse<00:03:14.470> for<00:03:14.650> me<00:03:14.769> behaving

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
there's just an excuse for me behaving

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
my own I think I like to believe a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.140 
my own I think I like to believe a
humanist<00:04:04.739> more<00:04:05.250> than<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> feminist<00:04:05.880> with<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
humanist more than a feminist with the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.460 
humanist more than a feminist with the
kind<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.390> films<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.810> are<00:04:06.930> being<00:04:06.959> made<00:04:07.200> this

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
kind of films that are being made this

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.290 
kind of films that are being made this
this<00:04:07.860> year<00:04:08.100> especially<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.640> think<00:04:08.910> was<00:04:09.000> great

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
this year especially I think was great

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.360 
this year especially I think was great
for<00:04:09.690> women<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.019> had<00:04:10.200> such<00:04:10.440> meeting<00:04:10.920> amazing

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
for women you had such meeting amazing

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.820 
for women you had such meeting amazing
roles<00:04:11.610> with<00:04:11.880> Vidya<00:04:12.269> in<00:04:12.780> kahani<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.739> had

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
roles with Vidya in kahani and you had

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.640 
roles with Vidya in kahani and you had
barfi<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.400> your<00:04:14.790> others<00:04:15.290> do<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.350> think

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
barfi and your others do you think

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.219 
barfi and your others do you think
finally<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.459> dynamics<00:04:18.030> are<00:04:18.180> changing

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
finally the dynamics are changing

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.900 
finally the dynamics are changing
essentially<00:04:19.229> if<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.500> look<00:04:19.530> at<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.950> yeah<00:04:20.489> it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
essentially if you look at it yeah it

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.280 
essentially if you look at it yeah it
