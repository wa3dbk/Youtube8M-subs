hi everybody today I'm going to do a
follow<00:00:06.700> up<00:00:06.819> opening<00:00:07.779> review<00:00:08.290> for<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.670> four

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
follow up opening review for the four

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.520 
follow up opening review for the four
channel<00:00:11.010> copter<00:00:12.010> micro<00:00:12.430> series<00:00:12.730> and<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
channel copter micro series and the

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.160 
channel copter micro series and the
model<00:00:14.830> is<00:00:14.949> v9<00:00:15.400> 1:1<00:00:15.969> and<00:00:16.180> I'm<00:00:16.390> surprised<00:00:16.869> they

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
model is v9 1:1 and I'm surprised they

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.860 
model is v9 1:1 and I'm surprised they
did<00:00:17.470> not<00:00:17.710> change<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.400> model<00:00:18.870> because

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
did not change the model because

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.120 
did not change the model because
supposedly<00:00:20.620> this<00:00:20.890> one<00:00:21.130> has<00:00:21.370> a<00:00:21.730> different

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
supposedly this one has a different

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.610 
supposedly this one has a different
connector<00:00:24.130> for<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.780> for<00:00:25.780> the<00:00:25.900> battery<00:00:26.200> so

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 
connector for the for the battery so

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.930 
connector for the for the battery so
this<00:00:27.010> one<00:00:30.360> comes<00:00:31.360> like<00:00:31.539> this<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.730> weird

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
this one comes like this and the weird

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.010 
this one comes like this and the weird
part<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.360> that<00:00:34.629> they<00:00:34.809> didn't<00:00:35.170> change<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
part is that they didn't change the the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.770 
part is that they didn't change the the
pictures<00:00:38.410> here<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.980> show<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:40.150> different<00:00:40.570> type

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
pictures here to show the different type

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.420 
pictures here to show the different type
of<00:00:40.810> batteries<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.590> come<00:00:41.770> with<00:00:41.950> it<00:00:44.100> show<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
of batteries that come with it show the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:01:00.090 
of batteries that come with it show the
box<00:00:45.700> from<00:00:45.940> all<00:00:46.149> four<00:00:46.480> sides<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.140> let's<00:00:59.710> open<00:00:59.860> it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
box from all four sides so let's open it

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.119 
box from all four sides so let's open it
up

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so huh I'm curious to see if they change

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.749 
so huh I'm curious to see if they change
the<00:01:19.380> manual<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.610> reflect<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.330> their<00:01:21.450> battery

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
the manual to reflect in their battery

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.940 
the manual to reflect in their battery
nope<00:01:24.920> see<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> manual<00:01:27.750> still<00:01:28.200> shows<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.680> old

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
nope see the manual still shows the old

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.790 
nope see the manual still shows the old
batteries<00:01:30.619> also<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:32.869> hi<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.110> let's<00:01:34.590> take<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
batteries also here hi so let's take a

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.139 
batteries also here hi so let's take a
look<00:01:35.009> let's<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.550> look<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.030> new

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
look let's take a look at the new

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.639 
look let's take a look at the new
batteries<00:01:36.570> because<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> what

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
batteries because really this is what

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.130 
batteries because really this is what
matters<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.450> same<00:01:39.720> helicopter

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
matters it's really the same helicopter

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.100 
matters it's really the same helicopter
as<00:01:40.770> before<00:01:41.250> only<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.970> improved<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
as before only they improved on the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.169 
as before only they improved on the
batteries<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> new

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
batteries so this is the the new

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.210 
batteries so this is the the new
connector<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:50.360> let's<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.990> goes<00:01:52.259> in

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
connector and let's see how it goes in

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.560 
connector and let's see how it goes in
the<00:01:54.000> helicopter<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:56.789> pretty<00:01:57.300> much<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the helicopter so it's pretty much the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.950 
the helicopter so it's pretty much the
same<00:01:57.750> helicopter<00:01:58.380> only<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.700> changed<00:02:00.600> away

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
same helicopter only they changed away

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:14.990 
same helicopter only they changed away
the<00:02:01.679> battery<00:02:01.979> connects<00:02:02.429> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> back<00:02:14.000> some

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the battery connects in the back some

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.509 
the battery connects in the back some
focus<00:02:15.480> here<00:02:18.470> I'm<00:02:19.470> gonna<00:02:19.709> slide<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
focus here I'm gonna slide it in and

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.910 
focus here I'm gonna slide it in and
we'll<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.329> easier<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.680> yeah<00:02:25.890> I

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
we'll see if it's much easier and yeah I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.100 
mean it's much easier that was my
biggest<00:02:28.790> problem<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.150> helicopter<00:02:30.630> oh

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
pretty much stayed the same the remote

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.540 
pretty much stayed the same the remote
stay<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.459> same

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.710 

this<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.820> truly<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.240> really<00:03:08.570> nice<00:03:08.720> product<00:03:09.080> and

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
this is truly a really nice product and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.140 
this is truly a really nice product and
with<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.900> change<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:12.830> can<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.670> highly

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
with this change I can really highly

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.230 
with this change I can really highly
highly<00:03:14.450> recommend<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.370> with<00:03:16.370> with<00:03:17.090> no

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
highly recommend it with with no

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.080 
highly recommend it with with no
hesitation<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.590> obviously<00:03:19.190> they<00:03:19.430> had<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.910> also

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
hesitation so obviously they had to also

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.720 
hesitation so obviously they had to also
redesign<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.260> charger<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.280> charger<00:03:22.700> has

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
redesign the charger and the charger has

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.600 
redesign the charger and the charger has
this<00:03:23.360> type<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.750> connector<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.680> well<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:25.520> I

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
this type of connector as well and I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.970 
this type of connector as well and I
like<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:26.030> they<00:03:26.180> put<00:03:26.390> this<00:03:26.630> little<00:03:26.690> notch<00:03:27.290> so

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
like that they put this little notch so

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.140 
like that they put this little notch so
you<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.280> which<00:03:28.520> side<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:29.000> goes<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:34.150> go

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
you know which side it goes and go

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:48.309 
you know which side it goes and go
easily<00:03:35.390> in

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.430 

I<00:03:48.409> guess

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.260 

pretty<00:04:00.900> easy<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.200> charge<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:08.090> way<00:04:09.090> better

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
pretty easy to charge and way better

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.210 
pretty easy to charge and way better
