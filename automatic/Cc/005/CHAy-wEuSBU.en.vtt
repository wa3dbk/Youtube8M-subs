00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay we're landing to have a new base on

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.560 
okay we're landing to have a new base on
the<00:00:04.410> way<00:00:06.140> okay<00:00:07.140> here<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.410> go

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
the way okay here we go

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.339 
the way okay here we go
they're<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.870> garbage<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.380> frozen<00:00:10.830> rusty<00:00:12.349> and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
they're just garbage a frozen rusty and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.990 
they're just garbage a frozen rusty and
by<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> way<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:14.190> doesn't<00:00:14.429> matter<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
by the way it doesn't matter if the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.090 
by the way it doesn't matter if the
Internet's<00:00:15.360> burnt<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> off<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.230> all<00:00:16.949> the

modeling<00:00:19.170> love<00:00:19.470> syntax<00:00:20.960> there<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> reason

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
modeling love syntax there was a reason

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.800 
modeling love syntax there was a reason
why<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> flash<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
why so that this is a flash of the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:47.880 
why so that this is a flash of the
ground<00:00:32.930> very<00:00:33.930> please<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.890> how<00:00:34.950> close<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.219> are

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.680 

what<00:00:48.890> was<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.040> again<00:00:49.309> let's<00:00:49.879> go<00:00:50.030> back<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.390> I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
what was that again let's go back to I

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
it's not a good time to really change

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.600 
it's not a good time to really change
much<00:01:04.759> of<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.089> guy's<00:01:05.800> okay<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.250> have<00:01:07.490> we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
much of this guy's okay and have we

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.450 
much of this guy's okay and have we
landed<00:01:08.080> we<00:01:09.080> have<00:01:09.229> lambdas<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:10.190> need<00:01:10.340> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
landed we have lambdas but we need to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.740 
landed we have lambdas but we need to
get<00:01:10.610> rid<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.790> these<00:01:11.000> stupid<00:01:11.270> engine<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:14.570> maybe

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
get rid of these stupid engine so maybe

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.020 
get rid of these stupid engine so maybe
if<00:01:14.899> we<00:01:16.869> lose<00:01:17.869> here<00:01:18.369> we<00:01:19.369> better<00:01:19.580> not<00:01:19.729> let<00:01:19.850> this

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
if we lose here we better not let this

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:33.490 
if we lose here we better not let this
thing<00:01:20.210> upside<00:01:20.390> down<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.080> go<00:01:25.750> see<00:01:26.750> our<00:01:27.100> deal

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.390 

here<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.620> go<00:01:36.770> well<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> flag<00:01:38.070> does<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
here we go well the flag does it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
here we go well the flag does it
hopefully<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> North<00:01:39.840> Pole<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.380> moon

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
hopefully and the North Pole of the moon

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.950 
hopefully and the North Pole of the moon
which<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:41.490> always<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> doesn't

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
which will always be some it doesn't

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.060 
which will always be some it doesn't
matter<00:01:43.140> which<00:01:43.260> way<00:01:43.409> around<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.830> going

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
matter which way around this is going

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.260 
matter which way around this is going
the<00:01:44.190> glue<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> descending<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:44.940> here<00:01:45.090> some

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the glue is descending up here some

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.850 
the glue is descending up here some
walls<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.600> able<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.840> verify<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.409> there

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
walls to be able to verify it's up there

00:01:46.860 --> 00:02:04.790 
walls to be able to verify it's up there
that's<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.400> idea

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:21.170 

oh<00:02:14.930> yeah<00:02:17.210> how<00:02:18.210> about<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:20.550> moonbase

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
oh yeah how about that one moonbase

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.730 
oh yeah how about that one moonbase
landed<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> moon<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.470> go<00:02:25.590> for

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
landed on the moon and now we can go for

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.950 
landed on the moon and now we can go for
a<00:02:25.770> new<00:02:25.890> view<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.250> our<00:02:26.370> new<00:02:26.880> base

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
a new view on our new base

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.150 
a new view on our new base
how<00:02:28.830> about<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.760> none<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.650> moon<00:02:31.650> lander

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
how about that none of this moon lander

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.880 
how about that none of this moon lander
crap<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.640> put<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.850> really<00:02:33.300> base<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.900> okay<00:02:34.590> da<00:02:34.830> da

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
crap we put a really base now okay da da

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.350 
crap we put a really base now okay da da
da<00:02:35.220> da<00:02:35.280> da<00:02:36.020> da<00:02:37.020> da<00:02:37.080> da<00:02:37.470> da<00:02:37.530> da

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
that's so Dave hasn't the Stratus did

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.540 
that's so Dave hasn't the Stratus did
little<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.870> did<00:02:43.050> did<00:02:43.320> did<00:02:43.560> did<00:02:43.770> did<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.370> look

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
little it did did did did did it look

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.260 
little it did did did did did it look
today<00:02:46.010> we're<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.160> for<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> walk<00:02:47.610> down<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
today we're going for a walk down in the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.670 
today we're going for a walk down in the
moon<00:02:48.420> base<00:02:50.960> there's<00:02:51.960> another<00:02:52.200> pot<00:02:52.440> plant

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
moon base there's another pot plant

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.750 
moon base there's another pot plant
there

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.319 

and<00:02:59.810> yeah<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.409> think<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:02.370> really<00:03:02.489> cool<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
and yeah I think it's really cool so

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.280 
and yeah I think it's really cool so
what<00:03:03.450> will<00:03:03.540> happen<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.870> because<00:03:03.900> we're<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
what will happen is because we're on the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.360 
what will happen is because we're on the
North<00:03:04.500> Pole<00:03:04.709> there's<00:03:04.920> something<00:03:05.159> always

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
North Pole there's something always

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.009 
North Pole there's something always
shining<00:03:05.610> through<00:03:06.000> one<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> these<00:03:06.329> windows<00:03:06.540> so

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
shining through one of these windows so

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.509 
shining through one of these windows so
all<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.709> parts<00:03:07.980> were<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> little<00:03:08.189> bit<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> bit

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
all of the parts were a little bit a bit

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.479 
all of the parts were a little bit a bit
of<00:03:08.670> them<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.120> bit<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.810> sunlight<00:03:10.250> I'll<00:03:11.250> show<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
of them a bit of sunlight I'll show you

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.319 
of them a bit of sunlight I'll show you
a<00:03:11.640> map

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
a map

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.610 
a map
it's<00:03:12.689> basically<00:03:13.049> after<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.319> sun's<00:03:13.530> gonna

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
it's basically after the sun's gonna

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
it's basically after the sun's gonna
come<00:03:13.739> home<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.220> risin<00:03:14.640> what<00:03:15.390> am<00:03:15.480> i<00:03:15.569> doing

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
windows that's always gonna lighten up a

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:50.000 
windows that's always gonna lighten up a
bit<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.389> thing<00:03:39.540> yeah<00:03:47.540> hmm<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.859> might<00:03:49.859> have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
bit of thing yeah hmm I might have

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.910 
bit of thing yeah hmm I might have
chosen<00:03:50.040> whiter<00:03:50.519> my<00:03:51.180> landing<00:03:52.049> selection<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.739> bit

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
chosen whiter my landing selection a bit

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.069 
chosen whiter my landing selection a bit
better<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:54.349> mean<00:03:55.349> it's<00:03:55.500> not<00:03:55.590> bad<00:03:57.079> there

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
better I mean it's not bad there

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.360 
better I mean it's not bad there
probably<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.439> a<00:03:58.470> better<00:03:58.650> location<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.220> could

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
probably is a better location I could

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.319 
probably is a better location I could
date<00:03:59.780> they'll<00:04:00.780> give<00:04:00.930> me<00:04:00.959> more<00:04:01.260> daylight

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
date they'll give me more daylight

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.229 
date they'll give me more daylight
that's<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.569> can<00:04:03.720> probably<00:04:03.870> see<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:06.060> you

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
that's you can probably see it and you

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.599 
that's you can probably see it and you
see<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:07.079> there<00:04:07.230> gets<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:08.280> bode

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
see that that bit there gets just bode

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:15.349 
see that that bit there gets just bode
up<00:04:09.919> how<00:04:10.919> about<00:04:10.949> up<00:04:11.280> here<00:04:13.909> so<00:04:14.909> somewhere<00:04:15.209> about

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
up how about up here so somewhere about

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.520 
up how about up here so somewhere about
here<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.810> one<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.229> most<00:04:16.349> ideal

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
here would be one of the most ideal

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.330 
here would be one of the most ideal
spots<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.159> get<00:04:17.280> daylight<00:04:18.320> 24/7<00:04:19.320> because<00:04:20.039> right

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
spots to get daylight 24/7 because right

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.770 
spots to get daylight 24/7 because right
now<00:04:20.459> I'm<00:04:20.579> mainly<00:04:20.760> I'm<00:04:20.909> getting<00:04:21.209> partial<00:04:21.630> light

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
now I'm mainly I'm getting partial light

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.350 
now I'm mainly I'm getting partial light
it's<00:04:22.049> not<00:04:22.199> too<00:04:22.349> bad<00:04:22.699> it's<00:04:23.699> not<00:04:23.880> as<00:04:23.940> bad<00:04:24.060> as<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.270> I

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
it's not too bad it's not as bad as if I

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.969 
it's not too bad it's not as bad as if I
was<00:04:24.449> on<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.570> equator<00:04:24.810> I'll<00:04:25.080> get<00:04:25.260> loads<00:04:25.650> of

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
was on the equator I'll get loads of

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.550 
was on the equator I'll get loads of
darkness<00:04:26.479> but<00:04:27.479> erm<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.960> could<00:04:28.139> probably<00:04:28.320> do

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
darkness but erm I could probably do

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.939 
darkness but erm I could probably do
with<00:04:28.590> someone<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.039> bit<00:04:29.190> better<00:04:30.710> yeah<00:04:31.710> play

sure there's enough food and oxygen what
if<00:04:40.919> we<00:04:40.979> went<00:04:41.099> around<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.750> yeah<00:04:42.750> but<00:04:42.930> these<00:04:43.050> are

these little tanks that produce some

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.520 
these little tanks that produce some
oxygen<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:52.280> yeah<00:04:53.280> here<00:04:53.460> we<00:04:53.490> are

that<00:06:40.220> it<00:06:40.430> required<00:06:40.810> 14<00:06:41.810> acres<00:06:42.080> of<00:06:43.270> biomass<00:06:44.270> to

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479

little Siddharth GP sees enough to snow

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.260 
little Siddharth GP sees enough to snow
because<00:07:03.009> there's<00:07:03.129> nothing<00:07:03.250> answer<00:07:03.669> to<00:07:03.819> absorb

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
because there's nothing answer to absorb

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.850 
because there's nothing answer to absorb
it<00:07:04.389> out<00:07:04.509> and<00:07:05.199> this<00:07:05.319> is<00:07:05.379> my<00:07:05.560> look<00:07:05.680> at<00:07:05.800> the

how<00:07:35.979> should<00:07:36.219> I<00:07:36.310> even<00:07:36.490> prove<00:07:36.759> the<00:07:36.940> moon<00:07:37.090> base

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
how should I even prove the moon base

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.570 
how should I even prove the moon base
and<00:07:37.419> if<00:07:37.539> one<00:07:37.659> says<00:07:37.780> oh<00:07:37.960> yeah<00:07:38.229> texturing<00:07:38.889> and<00:07:39.190> I

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
and if one says oh yeah texturing and I

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.920 
and if one says oh yeah texturing and I
know<00:07:39.639> what<00:07:39.819> you<00:07:39.879> mean<00:07:39.969> like<00:07:40.210> it's<00:07:40.599> down<00:07:40.750> there

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930 
know what you mean like it's down there

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.800 
know what you mean like it's down there
I<00:07:41.199> could<00:07:41.979> do<00:07:42.069> with<00:07:42.250> merging<00:07:42.669> those<00:07:42.849> dimples

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
I could do with merging those dimples

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.360 
I could do with merging those dimples
together<00:07:44.110> and<00:07:44.349> there<00:07:44.800> may<00:07:44.919> be<00:07:44.949> a<00:07:45.069> few<00:07:45.340> more

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370 
together and there may be a few more

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.580 
together and there may be a few more
control<00:07:46.060> panels<00:07:46.419> and<00:07:46.479> things<00:07:46.690> and<00:07:47.289> yeah<00:07:47.469> you

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
control panels and things and yeah you

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.809 
control panels and things and yeah you
might<00:07:47.740> argue<00:07:47.889> I<00:07:48.069> need<00:07:48.219> to<00:07:48.310> merge<00:07:48.520> these

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:48.819 
might argue I need to merge these

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.629 
might argue I need to merge these
together<00:07:49.210> well<00:07:49.930> it<00:07:50.080> see<00:07:50.259> it's<00:07:51.099> a<00:07:51.190> good<00:07:51.340> start

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 
together well it see it's a good start

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.000 
together well it see it's a good start
isn't<00:07:51.849> it
