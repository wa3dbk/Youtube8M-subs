00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.260
 with a quick action we can say that the 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.020
 So 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.290
 as I said previously felipe dylon none of this although the list in hand 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.319
 nino's place 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.810
 the beach park wanted very very hard 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.380
 he will conduct a good campaign and fight bush for the fall of a bridge in the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 bigger than that we're in the afternoon this morning 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.750
 1 over time 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.910
 he may have to do the service better 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.060
 on the heel 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.370
 of a Hawaiian slipper and will be from here 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.520
 then to the door of the plane that prepared for that moment 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.890
 only unfortunately do not beware of him the dogs destroyed 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.420
 so now I'll show you 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.110
 in the month and the whole year but in fact you have to go 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.340
 cut a little bit second 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.050
 in the correct position 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.190
 then policing complied when talking outside 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.990
 both the sanding 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.500
 how water can be made that way 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 Okay, so we'll have a little bit here. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.050
 finally you will have the list always 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.340
 a little water passing 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.510
 and you will agree Scottish 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510
 with a format 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.460
 with the format of the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.890
 the rubber of the genre so I'm going to leave one here just so you guys have a 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.580
 idea 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.750
 How is it done? 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.120
 so it is not because they have already left 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.890
 the background prepared the piece beforehand 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.060
 - Work, you're going to work. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.530
 at this stage 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.210
 this is one of the phases 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.780
 I particularly like the service because the farm you start 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.200
 to see the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 the result appeared 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.980
 itamar 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 here you can have a legal idea 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.110
 Can you get a legal idea? 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.659
 doctor antÃ³nio 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.819
 of mass that effectively ends up 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.909
 on here 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.669
 here it ended up getting something and apparently there was nothing here 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.569
 some holes in our cable 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.999
 filling up there too that she wanted to stay 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.139
 that probably does not die embassy and that we do not realize 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.569
 there is the advantage of doing that technique 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.069
 spare me a connection with the group 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.299
 because when you 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.059
 apply the 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:39.369
 oo the aine lined up there as with alicia 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.589
 there are some places that are going to stay so what are these places if 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.909
 were in the case of edu 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.049
 and the bus has to apply 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.369
 the rapid mass 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.829
 to then let everyone analyze 220 voll air 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.689
 every cap 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.530
 After you've left us, we'll come back and see the result.
