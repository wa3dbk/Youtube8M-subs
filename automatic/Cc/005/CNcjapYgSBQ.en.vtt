 in Lauscha a well-known summer and winter well cared for in the Thuringian Forest 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.029
 is home to the glass craft 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.400
 Here in 1811 the glassmaker Lutz was not born müller-uri 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.770
 in 1835, on the advice of a Würzburg physician, the artificial one 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.770
 People eye made of glass in Germany 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 a working table with bellows from that time 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.060
 Numerous medals and diplomas could be of highest recognition 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.990

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.940
 the family tradition is through the staff of the eyes and ethics Lauscha

 GmbH 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.789
 continued in a modern operation 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.850
 in bright, friendly workspaces, a video analysis is just a matter of making a video 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.360
 between medical technology cosmetics 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.180
 Precision and craftsmanship 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 Lifelike eyes Prostheses made of glass 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.760
 Many years of training and experience are required for this profession 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.680
 in patient care on the physical and mental issues 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 to be able to respond accordingly 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.970
 made of a special glass 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.550
 A certain amount of glass for an eye prosthesis is melted off 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.210
 This glass is cows Olic clouded special glass for 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.039
 People's eyes 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.900
 in different coloring 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.760
 which is pulled out of the glass factory Lauscha 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.950
 as well as the rest of the material for the production of prostheses 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.539
 her history of a human eye prosthesis at a glance 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.659
 this is just a small part of the rich color palette 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
 human eyes 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.939
 for training in the eyes prosthetics and in ophthalmology 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.189
 The most diverse eye diseases were reproduced in glass 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.889
 These interstitial prostheses are named after the Nuclear Zion for the 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.679
 Healing process used 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.839
 on the example of the patient and light v you can now see the complete procedure in 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.839
 no eye prosthesis 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.469
 the previous prosthesis is removed 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.999
 who is eyepiece is now looking for the healthy eye the right eye color 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.999
 with the appropriate structure for the class protests 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.389
 First, as previously shown from the special glass tube 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.150
 a red healing melted off 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
 and inflated into a ball in further processing 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:43.759
 on this ball is by applying different color of the glasses greed 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.759
 is imitated true to nature 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.020
 for the size of the eye intended for the patient 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.020
 Now only the deficiencies will be reduced accordingly 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.690
 applying the artificial blood vessels 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.690
 have this blade 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.209
 Design of the eye forms in constant comparison to the present 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.209
 template 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.949
 Gradually, the abduction of the eyes prosthesis by finely dosed the arises 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.949
 pull out of the air 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.969
 For a good fit of the new prosthesis is a constant measure of control 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.969
 required 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.020
 separating the eyes prosthesis by hand 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.449
 the finished on the denture is moistened in a special solution and 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:38.550
 the patient 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.550
 used together 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.270
 Through such an eye prosthesis, a good cosmetic goal is achieved 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.529
 and thus for the patient the psychological security in the private and professional 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:55.060
 Life restored
