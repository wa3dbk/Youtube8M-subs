listen here I'll hear them kind of pop

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.150 
listen here I'll hear them kind of pop
as<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.840> move<00:02:46.020> our<00:02:46.140> fingers<00:02:46.470> over<00:02:46.710> them<00:02:46.890> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
as we move our fingers over them and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160 
as we move our fingers over them and
when<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.790> press<00:02:48.120> them<00:02:48.330> not<00:02:48.750> sure<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.050> it's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
when we press them not sure if it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.570 
when we press them not sure if it's
shown<00:02:49.320> up<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.620> video<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.070> there's<00:02:50.190> actually<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
shown up on video but there's actually a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400 
shown up on video but there's actually a
good<00:02:50.760> amount<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.090> flex<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.660> you'll<00:02:51.840> find<00:02:52.170> in

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
good amount of flex that you'll find in

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.560 
good amount of flex that you'll find in
this<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.280> there's<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.610> little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.060> concern

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
this so there's a little bit of concern

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.780 
this so there's a little bit of concern
with<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.870> overall<00:02:55.500> feel<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> keypad<00:02:56.460> and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
with the overall feel of the keypad and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.330 
with the overall feel of the keypad and
the<00:02:57.450> durability<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.230> general<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.800> hopefully

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the durability in general so hopefully

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.270 
the durability in general so hopefully
those<00:02:59.520> will<00:02:59.580> hold<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.920> will<00:03:02.070> say

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
those will hold up for you we will say

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.880 
those will hold up for you we will say
that<00:03:02.520> overall<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.420> design<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> rugby<00:03:04.560> 3

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that overall the design of the rugby 3

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.990 
that overall the design of the rugby 3
it<00:03:05.700> doesn't<00:03:06.270> have<00:03:06.390> any<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.990> typical

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
it doesn't have any of the typical

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.940 
it doesn't have any of the typical
rubberized<00:03:09.000> accents<00:03:09.900> or<00:03:10.020> rubberized<00:03:10.410> padding

rubberized accents or rubberized padding
even<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.340> you'll<00:03:11.490> find<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.910> most<00:03:12.350> tough

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
even that you'll find on most tough

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.530 
even that you'll find on most tough
devices<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.640> constructive<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.270> pretty

side but pop the battery door back on
you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.720> see<00:03:25.020> there<00:03:25.200> it's<00:03:25.470> dimpled<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.160> those

you can see there it's dimpled but those

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.700 
you can see there it's dimpled but those
dimples<00:03:26.490> actually<00:03:26.970> go<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.420> which<00:03:28.170> makes<00:03:28.440> it

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
dimples actually go in which makes it

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.950 
dimples actually go in which makes it
even<00:03:29.130> more<00:03:29.370> slick<00:03:29.880> if<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.330> dimples<00:03:30.810> were

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
even more slick if the dimples were

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.050 
even more slick if the dimples were
popping<00:03:31.230> out<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:32.250> would<00:03:32.430> give<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.640> some<00:03:32.670> more

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
popping out it would give you some more

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.940 
popping out it would give you some more
grip<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.810> back<00:03:33.960> of<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.200> device<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.740> it's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
grip on the back of the device but it's

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.250 
grip on the back of the device but it's
a<00:03:35.040> pretty<00:03:35.250> slippery<00:03:35.520> device<00:03:35.940> when<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.020> think

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
a pretty slippery device when you think

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.380 
a pretty slippery device when you think
about<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.770> other<00:03:38.070> rugged<00:03:38.460> devices<00:03:38.760> out<00:03:39.120> there

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
about the other rugged devices out there
