so let's take a closer look into the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that we of course had to fulfill but at

but not footballs

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.720 
but not footballs
this<00:00:24.240> took<00:00:24.540> until<00:00:24.750> basically<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.770> mid<00:00:26.070> 60's

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

this took until basically the mid 60's
when<00:00:27.390> he<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.110> first<00:00:28.200> time<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:29.130> also

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
when he for the first time actually also

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
when he for the first time actually also
produced<00:00:30.210> footballs<00:00:31.020> and<00:00:31.110> it<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.320> actually

milestone<00:00:42.839> for<00:00:42.870> adidas<00:00:43.469> came<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.999> 1970<00:00:44.999> when

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
milestone for adidas came in 1970 when

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
milestone for adidas came in 1970 when
the<00:00:45.719> world<00:00:46.019> was<00:00:46.260> looking<00:00:46.589> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> World<00:00:47.010> Cup

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the world was looking to the World Cup

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.009 
the world was looking to the World Cup
that<00:00:47.249> took<00:00:47.460> place<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.820> Mexico<00:00:47.999> and<00:00:48.749> you<00:00:48.839> might

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
that took place in Mexico and you might

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.959 
that took place in Mexico and you might
remember<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.100> time<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
remember it was the first time that the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.750 
remember it was the first time that the
World<00:00:51.179> Cup<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:52.109> globally<00:00:52.769> broadcast<00:00:53.339> at<00:00:53.550> with

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
World Cup was globally broadcast at with

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.380 
World Cup was globally broadcast at with
satellite<00:00:54.239> TV<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:56.339> probably<00:00:56.999> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
satellite TV so that was probably a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.939 
satellite TV so that was probably a
milestone<00:00:57.629> also<00:00:58.079> father<00:00:58.350> does<00:00:58.559> football

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
milestone also father does football

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.000 
milestone also father does football
because<00:00:59.339> that<00:00:59.789> Telstar<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.989> seen<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.499> every

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
because that Telstar was seen in every

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
because that Telstar was seen in every
match<00:01:02.249> and<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:02.999> was<00:01:03.179> an<00:01:03.420> outstanding<00:01:03.960> success

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
match and it was an outstanding success

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.360 
match and it was an outstanding success
in<00:01:04.890> those<00:01:05.460> years<00:01:06.210> since<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.830> gradually

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
in those years since then we gradually

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.690 
in those years since then we gradually
improved<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:10.260> balls<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.710> only<00:01:11.100> from<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
improved the balls not only from a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.790 
improved the balls not only from a
performance<00:01:12.150> characteristics<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.530> also

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
performance characteristics but we also

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.000 
performance characteristics but we also
looked<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.200> ball<00:01:16.470> actually

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
looked into the way the ball actually

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.820 
looked into the way the ball actually
can<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.370> seen<00:01:17.730> by<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.480> spectators<00:01:19.050> or<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.800> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
can be seen by the spectators or on a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
can be seen by the spectators or on a
camera<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> next<00:01:21.660> big

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
camera and I think the next big

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.460 
camera and I think the next big
milestone<00:01:22.050> came<00:01:22.620> with<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> tango<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.120> was

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
milestone came with the tango that was

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
milestone came with the tango that was
developed<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.360> World<00:01:27.360> Cup<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:28.250> 1978<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
developed for the World Cup in 1978 this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.710 
developed for the World Cup in 1978 this
tango<00:01:31.170> design<00:01:32.150> almost<00:01:33.150> gives<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
tango design almost gives you the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
tango design almost gives you the
impression<00:01:33.870> of<00:01:34.320> ten<00:01:34.740> identical<00:01:35.490> circles<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
impression of ten identical circles that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
impression of ten identical circles that
were<00:01:36.330> seen<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> ball<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.100> uh

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
were seen on the ball and I was uh

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
were seen on the ball and I was uh
turning<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.880> design<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.780> became

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
turning and that design actually became

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.650 
turning and that design actually became
almost<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.280> milestone<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
almost like a milestone and a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.680 
almost like a milestone and a
recognition<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.920> key<00:01:44.250> identifier<00:01:44.910> for

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
recognition or an a key identifier for

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.190 
recognition or an a key identifier for
Adidas<00:01:46.200> match<00:01:46.650> balls<00:01:47.100> since<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.690> early

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
Adidas match balls since these early

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.340 
Adidas match balls since these early
years<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.010> also<00:01:50.250> improved<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.300> way<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.230> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
years we also improved the way that the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.680 
years we also improved the way that the
materials<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.280> withstand<00:01:54.120> any<00:01:54.360> water

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
materials would withstand any water

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.500 
materials would withstand any water
uptake<00:01:55.020> which<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> worst<00:01:56.610> problem<00:01:57.360> in

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
uptake which was the worst problem in

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.290 
uptake which was the worst problem in
the<00:01:57.840> early<00:01:57.870> decades<00:01:58.440> when<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.700> match<00:01:59.910> balls

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
the early decades when the match balls

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.780 
the early decades when the match balls
were<00:02:00.930> seen<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.620> they<00:02:01.830> were<00:02:02.010> had<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> certain

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
were seen that they were had a certain

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.970 
were seen that they were had a certain
weight<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.300> beginning<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.260> over<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:04.650> game

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
weight in the beginning but over a game

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.340 
weight in the beginning but over a game
when<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.400> played<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.700> wet<00:02:06.090> conditions<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
when it was played in wet conditions the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.739 
when it was played in wet conditions the
the<00:02:08.039> ball<00:02:08.250> took<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:08.970> much<00:02:09.030> weight<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.659> you

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:09.749 
the ball took up so much weight and you

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.380 
the ball took up so much weight and you
can<00:02:09.899> imagine<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.499> a<00:02:10.679> striker<00:02:11.039> does<00:02:11.640> head<00:02:12.120> ball

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
can imagine if a striker does head ball

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.960 
can imagine if a striker does head ball
or<00:02:12.689> gets<00:02:13.019> gets<00:02:13.469> shot

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
or gets gets shot

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.990 
or gets gets shot
takes<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.750> shot<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:17.340> difficult<00:02:17.580> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
takes that shot it's it's difficult of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.630 
takes that shot it's it's difficult of
course<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.300> handle<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> because<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
course to handle and because of the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.890 
course to handle and because of the
irregularities<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.480> ball<00:02:21.660> weight

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
irregularities with with the ball weight

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.830 
irregularities with with the ball weight
so<00:02:22.710> we<00:02:22.920> worked<00:02:23.190> from<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.610> side<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
so we worked from that side and then I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.730 
so we worked from that side and then I
think<00:02:25.200> another<00:02:25.830> major<00:02:26.610> milestone<00:02:26.870> came<00:02:27.870> when

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
think another major milestone came when

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.190 
think another major milestone came when
we<00:02:29.130> found<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.820> new<00:02:30.090> method<00:02:30.360> through<00:02:30.750> our<00:02:30.870> added

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
we found a new method through our added

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.220 
we found a new method through our added
as<00:02:31.320> innovation<00:02:31.980> people<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:33.210> we<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.900> change

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
as innovation people that we can change

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.490 
as innovation people that we can change
the<00:02:34.500> manufacturing<00:02:35.400> process<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.240> match<00:02:37.110> balls

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the manufacturing process of match balls

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.040 
the manufacturing process of match balls
the<00:02:38.040> perfect<00:02:38.490> example<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.750> started

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the perfect example is and it started

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.930 
the perfect example is and it started
ready<00:02:40.230> two<00:02:40.500> years<00:02:40.740> earlier<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.490> ball<00:02:41.760> that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
ready two years earlier for a ball that

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.850 
ready two years earlier for a ball that
we<00:02:42.090> developed<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.750> European<00:02:43.320> champion

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
we developed for the European champion

ships<00:02:44.460> when<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.270> see<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:47.220> match<00:02:47.460> ball

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
ships when you see the the match ball

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.580 
ships when you see the the match ball
that<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.270> used<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.950> 2006<00:02:49.950> World<00:02:50.700> Cup<00:02:50.820> that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
that we used in the 2006 World Cup that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.950 
that we used in the 2006 World Cup that
ball<00:02:52.590> no<00:02:52.950> longer<00:02:53.580> uses<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> normal

ball no longer uses the normal
manufacturing<00:02:55.950> process<00:02:56.490> but<00:02:56.700> instead<00:02:57.210> comes

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
manufacturing process but instead comes

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.950 
manufacturing process but instead comes
with<00:02:58.380> thermally<00:02:59.070> bonded<00:02:59.630> panels<00:03:00.630> and

elements<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.190> not<00:03:02.460> only<00:03:02.790> created<00:03:03.150> much

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
elements that not only created much

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.770 
elements that not only created much
smooth<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.230> surface<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:05.520> got<00:03:06.150> rid<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.420> the

smooth the surface but got rid of the
irregularities<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.950> would<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.280> in

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
irregularities that you would have in

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.660

the conventional manufacturing process

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.420 
the conventional manufacturing process
we<00:03:12.360> worked<00:03:12.660> further<00:03:13.050> with<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.590> system<00:03:14.160> and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
we worked further with that system and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.400 
we worked further with that system and
the<00:03:14.610> feedback<00:03:14.910> from<00:03:15.120> players<00:03:15.630> was<00:03:15.960> terrific

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
the feedback from players was terrific

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.040 
the feedback from players was terrific
and<00:03:16.980> now<00:03:17.460> if<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.880> take<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.810> latest

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and now if you take it to the latest

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.280 
and now if you take it to the latest
match<00:03:19.530> board<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.010> again<00:03:20.489> improved<00:03:21.150> from<00:03:22.050> that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
match board we again improved from that

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
match board we again improved from that
measurement<00:03:22.770> we<00:03:23.130> still<00:03:23.459> use<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.000> thermally

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
measurement we still use the thermally

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.310 
measurement we still use the thermally
bonded<00:03:26.000> manufacturing<00:03:27.000> process<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:28.290> a

smooth surface but it is rougher on the
outside<00:03:32.070> simply<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.880> give<00:03:33.150> players<00:03:33.660> more<00:03:33.989> grip

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.960 
outside simply to give players more grip
no<00:03:34.950> matter<00:03:35.190> what<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.520> weather<00:03:35.670> conditions

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
no matter what the weather conditions

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.320 
no matter what the weather conditions
would<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.650> extremely<00:03:38.430> stable<00:03:38.880> flight

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
would be and the extremely stable flight

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.630 
would be and the extremely stable flight
characteristics<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.800> what<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.370> players

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640

characteristics is what the players
feedback<00:03:42.180> was<00:03:42.390> mostly<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:43.350> about<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.890> think

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
feedback was mostly all about so I think

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.560 
feedback was mostly all about so I think
if<00:03:44.430> we<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.390> where<00:03:45.989> we<00:03:46.110> now<00:03:46.320> are<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:47.000> 2010<00:03:48.000> if

if we see where we now are in 2010 if
I'll<00:03:48.780> take<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.230> back<00:03:49.500> where<00:03:49.800> we<00:03:49.860> started<00:03:50.330> or

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
I'll take you back where we started or

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.690 
I'll take you back where we started or

they<00:04:00.840> measure<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.440> same<00:04:01.739> but<00:04:02.040> if<00:04:02.670> let's<00:04:03.030> say

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
they measure the same but if let's say

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.330 
they measure the same but if let's say
we<00:04:03.450> would<00:04:03.630> both<00:04:03.750> play<00:04:04.050> now<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.500> wet<00:04:04.739> conditions

that<00:04:06.030> one<00:04:06.209> probably<00:04:06.450> would<00:04:06.720> weigh<00:04:06.870> maybe

that one probably would weigh maybe

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.530 
that one probably would weigh maybe

twice the weight it has now this one

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.690 
twice the weight it has now this one
