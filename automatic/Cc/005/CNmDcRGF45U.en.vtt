00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
hoping that I won't get as many stretch

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
hoping that I won't get as many stretch
marks<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.820> time<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.020> show<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.229> well

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

before<00:01:28.799> picture<00:01:30.470> I'll<00:01:31.470> show<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> was

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.350 

so<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:40.220> before<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.490> started<00:01:41.640> using<00:01:42.030> bio

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
so that was before I started using bio

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.700 
so that was before I started using bio
oil<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.440> very<00:01:43.650> read<00:01:43.890> stretch<00:01:44.490> marks<00:01:45.710> from

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
oil I had very read stretch marks from

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.910 
oil I had very read stretch marks from
my<00:01:46.860> previous<00:01:47.100> pregnancy<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> where<00:01:49.650> I've<00:01:49.740> put

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
my previous pregnancy and where I've put

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
my previous pregnancy and where I've put
on<00:01:49.980> quite<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> bit<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.640> weight<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.150> as<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.900> can

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
on quite a bit of weight and as you can

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.060 
on quite a bit of weight and as you can
see<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.800> difference<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.960> fantastic<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.040> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
see the difference is fantastic now I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
see the difference is fantastic now I
don't<00:01:56.220> expect<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.060> miracle<00:01:57.300> cure<00:01:57.720> I'm

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
don't expect it to be a miracle cure I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
don't expect it to be a miracle cure I'm
sure<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.160> gonna<00:01:59.340> make<00:01:59.730> them<00:01:59.850> disappear

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
sure it's not gonna make them disappear

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.970 
sure it's not gonna make them disappear
overnight<00:02:01.550> but<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:02.700> helping<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.620> ease<00:02:04.620> them

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
overnight but it's helping to ease them

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.250 
overnight but it's helping to ease them
definitely<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.180> hoping<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.660> continued

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
definitely and I'm hoping with continued

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.660 
definitely and I'm hoping with continued
use<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:09.210> they<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.479> fade<00:02:09.660> even<00:02:09.840> more<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.670> will

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
use that they will fade even more I will

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.490 
use that they will fade even more I will
continue<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.270> using<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.990> pregnancy
