00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
thing is is that once a year we actually

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.930 
thing is is that once a year we actually
take<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.390> manual<00:03:25.989> read<00:03:26.230> at<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> same<00:03:26.560> time<00:03:27.489> that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
take a manual read at the same time that

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.380 
take a manual read at the same time that
the<00:03:28.410> electronic<00:03:29.410> read<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.370> being<00:03:30.700> taken<00:03:31.180> and

the electronic read is being taken and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.930 
the electronic read is being taken and
then<00:03:31.900> we<00:03:31.989> compare<00:03:32.440> those<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.519> make<00:03:33.730> sure

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
then we compare those and we make sure

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.570 
then we compare those and we make sure
that<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.510> reads<00:03:34.780> are<00:03:34.989> in<00:03:35.110> line<00:03:35.320> saving<00:03:36.310> time

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580

that the reads are in line saving time
and<00:03:36.880> money<00:03:37.000> are<00:03:37.570> only<00:03:37.750> two<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.440> many

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
advantages of this automated system it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.710 
advantages of this automated system it
actually<00:03:41.470> gives<00:03:42.280> us<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.489> ability<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.060> and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
actually gives us the ability to and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.360 
actually gives us the ability to and
pull<00:03:44.650> hourly<00:03:45.610> usage<00:03:46.049> from<00:03:47.160> someone's<00:03:48.160> meter

so<00:03:49.030> if<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.720> call<00:03:50.019> us<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.560> say<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:51.160> have<00:03:51.670> no

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
so if you call us and you say I have no

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.090 
so if you call us and you say I have no
clue<00:03:52.239> how<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.420> could<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:52.840> used<00:03:53.019> three<00:03:53.799> times

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
clue how I could have used three times

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.759 
clue how I could have used three times
as<00:03:54.310> much<00:03:54.459> usage<00:03:54.820> this<00:03:55.060> month<00:03:55.450> then<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.350> have<00:03:56.650> in

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
as much usage this month then I have in

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.860 
as much usage this month then I have in
the<00:03:56.890> past<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:58.150> checked<00:03:58.540> everything

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the past and you checked everything

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.050 
the past and you checked everything
you've<00:03:59.170> checked<00:03:59.350> your<00:03:59.500> irrigation<00:04:00.060> you've

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
you've checked your irrigation you've

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.580 
you've checked your irrigation you've
checked<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.720> make<00:04:01.780> sure<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:02.110> don't<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.440> any

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
checked to make sure you don't have any

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.850 
checked to make sure you don't have any
leaks<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:04.630> can<00:04:04.810> actually<00:04:04.959> send<00:04:05.320> someone<00:04:05.650> out

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860
