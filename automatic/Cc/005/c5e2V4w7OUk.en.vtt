00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
at the new phosphor world time curve

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.070 
at the new phosphor world time curve
it's<00:00:19.290> in<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.890> ink<00:00:20.369> digital<00:00:21.090> watch<00:00:21.330> let's<00:00:21.900> take<00:00:22.050> a

small time and then you have a world

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.390 
small time and then you have a world
time<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.710> this<00:02:10.710> one<00:02:10.860> gives<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.160> ability
