00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello together I join in today 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.609
 Christmas was high tech I got it 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.930
 seen and found at the dear andrea 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.340
 Cool him and thought I 'll do it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.290
 That's why I think I was even 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.130
 not shown but later theoretically 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.330
 actually no role 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 I'm sorry that now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.220
 again so a little time passed 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.320
 is up to the next video on me 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.939
 instagram and twitter and so follows 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 may know who was in malaga 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.910
 with dear star kat and eleven crime 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.470
 There we have a video shot on the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.199
 20 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.030
 is channel-ahead on the then and there 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.260
 it is still one of me and everything but 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.120
 everything 26th 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.410
 that user explanation why is now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.750
 somehow took so long 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.329
 Before we start the day you have 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.620
 maybe already seen it 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.879
 I put my heart into it and I have 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.579
 always a little bit of humor 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 matching the questions so I'll start 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.360
 with the question 1 then you really catch 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.739
 to buy gingerbread and decorate 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 So I have to say I do not like any 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 That's why I never catch gingerbread with it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.609
 to buy gingerbread but decorate 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 is so different for me must 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.850
 say this year it was completely with me 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.769
 it's still bad 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 Decorated so I have the stuff now 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.680
 all worn down and they stand 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.970
 in the living room but yes I am somehow 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.470
 not yet come to something 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.729
 from somewhere to do so 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.509
 only thing I really decorated now 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 I've come in handy that was here and there 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.479
 very proud of myself, I must say 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.350
 asks number 2 how stressful is that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.210
 Christmas time really for you 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.700
 I think it's always a bit like that 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.110
 hard to find gifts for everyone and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.299
 that's why it's kind of like that 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.619
 a kind of stress because I think so in 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.119
 the vorweihnachtszeit then comes yet 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.950
 a lot of times you can jam that fast 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 had to do and then was next to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.770
 to provide for gifts 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.899
 and sometimes they are a bit too 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.479
 more complicated things that is always 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.829
 not so easy and I think that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.899
 Christmas time in itself not quite 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.430
 so easy when you are so family 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.960
 there and there and then back and forth 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.549
 that's just always a bit like that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.509
 exhausting that's why I'm for 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.759
 basically Christmas 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.939
 It must be pretty hard to say it is 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.710
 Not at all as cheap as it could be 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.849
 let's ask three what do you want 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.470
 really the most 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.220
 So that's a really tough question 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.550
 even if you give it to me now 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.560
 probably does not believe 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.390
 but I do not want anything more to me I ils 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.750
 I think that's what you want most of all 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.070
 and the material is that is somehow 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.510
 that's two weeks back something 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.630
 completely different so it would always 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.640
 stupid sometime so I wish 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.900
 actually someday when I am 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.460
 Sometime something should die 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.530
 hopefully it will not be that far yet 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.470
 that I die happy then we say 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.220
 i have lived well and i have 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.510
 really lived and I do not regret anything 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.520
 so now except for such little things here 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.320
 I'm buying something but I mean 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.820
 Do not really regret what and me now 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.200
 I just really happy 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.700
 I really wish that to happen 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.240
 I think that's really it 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.560
 most important to be happy 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.050
 Sounds a bit clichÃ©d like this 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.930
 a little bit like me I'm a bad choice 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.080
 I want to win the miss and me 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.220
 I wish world peace that hunger 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.600
 nothing is lost for whom is it defeated ? 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.880
 most difficult a suitable gift 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.990
 to find 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.130
 So I would say for my whole 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.060
 family somehow so I finds for 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.160
 my parents always a bit 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.090
 difficult and I do not want anymore 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.489
 give as light 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.690
 every year so something new 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.630
 It's not just like that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.530
 blabla is not that easy and 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.209
 for my brother I think so too 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.170
 quite difficult yes basically 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.700
 it really only at 1 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.220
 my brother always like that with my parents 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.709
 Think about it a bit 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.629
 well but just what i am this year 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.159
 but a kitchen machine has requested 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.290
 Unfortunately, I already have something else for me 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.269
 the two good ones i hope they will 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.069
 not to be disappointed okay just ask 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.450
 five, what was the worst thing about you 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.209
 every christmas gift 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.560
 I thought so because then 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.349
 it does not really matter anymore 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.110
 but then i have in my childhood 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.670
 thought back and that we were back then 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.700
 but a fiat driver i that i was like that 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.109
 8 8 to 10 something in the shoot and we 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.819
 are always on the second day of Christmas 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.859
 to the whole family and there have the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.930
 children still a bit like that 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.159
 blabla and actually 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.690
 cool things get or hold such a thing 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.709
 vouchers are valid though in the age 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.190
 we have not got any money yet 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.299
 no matter 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.280
 but we always have such cool stuff 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.690
 I've always been so happy 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.669
 then it was a christmas because I have so 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.530
 a doll got but not such a 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.180
 baby born ross or would i be in 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.419
 the age namely full of pleasure no me 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.910
 have such a group so right 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.310
 ugly doll highest such as his 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.570
 Grandma always in the closet has so 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.560
 a doll has a dish that was 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.940
 really warm that has no 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.169
 long hair but she had so short 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.889
 you did not know if you were a male or a boy 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.650
 weiblein 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.090
 and yes that was the best present 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.139
 my mother had later told that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.370
 they actually already to those 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.090
 I could tell that to the child 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.320
 not hands 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.389
 I do not have the gift with me either 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.919
 it's actually taken home 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.349
 bad education or something 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.789
 ungrateful but I found the doll like that 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.090
 bad, that really scares me 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.570
 made that I did not touch her 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.039
 have or not with home 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.340
 ask number six how do you spend 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.800
 Christmas Eve this year I will be in 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.320
 Brunswick be my parents with mine 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.580
 brother my nephew and acquaintances with so 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.409
 that is so standard of old 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.940
 actually good and I'm happy too 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.139
 right because then I think so all 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.620
 come together one year 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.789
 and yes I find really beautiful as 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.930
 he was not so nice two years ago 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.320
 I think we are there because we are 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.880
 23 in the evening but still driven by the 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.380
 not checkout and we were somehow 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.229
 in the evening at eleven o'clock on the highway and 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.710
 I have 20 kilometers of Brunswick 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.969
 plates 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.229
 that was not so funny but otherwise 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.729
 I always look forward to the future 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.759
 drive when we are there then with 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.809
 bring in 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.129
 seventh, what do you think about it? 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.989
 Christmas in a warm country like that 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.949
 refer 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.269
 I think that would be fine for me 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.899
 I kind of need that for me somehow 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:49.889
 already a bit 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:51.259
 christmas mood i am now 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.029
 actually still 0 in christmas mood 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.169
 but at christmas itself I need 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.649
 the ones and I would have believed I want 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.789
 not that one 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:00.629
 So I need that a bit too 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:02.909
 fucking weather outside and fir-tree 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.259
 So a Christmas tree and it is included 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.459
 us always pretty cool so if i have 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.449
 then maybe not even in brackweden 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.139
 right when my mother lies down 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.369
 once fully loaded and yes so 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.009
 that's why warm landwehr would be then 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:15.389
 I do not believe anything for me 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.549
 Eighth, you can then still a poem 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.439
 or christmas song i also say 

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:21.449
 could actually times before many 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.949
 many years rufrecht that 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:29.089
 is now unfortunately so are only one 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:29.089
 few pieces there but where I what 

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:34.979
 I know that something nice here 

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:36.989
 Santa Claus I look at this evil 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.329
 Glue your good ones then I will 

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:40.709
 also be very good, I think so 

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:42.989
 do not know if you prefer your route 

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:44.159
 a pac or rather your good one is though 

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:45.269
 theoretically is a very short one 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.419
 Christmas poem and I am very proud 

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:49.379
 on me that I still within 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:53.099
 Ninth or without a real Christmas tree 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:55.169
 For me, that's a stupid thing 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:59.189
 ask because we have false bottom 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.449
 But it's just because it 's stupid 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:02.759
 I really like a real one for me 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.979
 It really has to be a real one 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.689
 Must smell like Christmas tree and 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.309
 At some point, the needles must deviate 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.619
 and that is that I really like 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:13.049
 dear nights 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:14.879
 At some point I have one more time 

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:20.189
 Last question your prediction is there 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:21.689
 snow on Christmas Eve so if then 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:23.429
 There's just so much of it physically 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:25.379
 Closer will not know about 

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:26.939
 something so I think so rather no 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:31.669
 and if only a little bit 

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:35.309
 so that's my forecast 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:38.159
 Okay that was the day 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:40.439
 i still think who i think now 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.299
 dear sabrina, because of me 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:44.939
 always directly and because they are quite a 

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:46.480
 love is and otherwise what is now 

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:49.330
 from me and I hope you 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.930
 still a nice time basically one 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
 beautiful time 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.450
 see you on then next time 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.450
 meet again
