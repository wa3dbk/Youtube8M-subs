00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.929
 Hello and welcome to a new video from Pocket Bike Expert 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.370
 We take as we go Bachmann when buying or after 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.789
 should consider the purchase of a Schieder bike 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.970
 and what you should exchange for the ride 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.400
 is pleasant and safe 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.589
 the pocket bike is also running well 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.499
 the first Martin Schaer would recommend doing 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 However, the team hose remain exchanged 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.240
 Here is once the ribbon hose of the offers contributed when you buy 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.890
 that can not really call gasoline hose 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.860
 that is not often clear that we were more 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 Prof, too, thinks so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.320
 everywhere 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.670
 since you can not rent at all for me no gas hose 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.070
 That's why buying necessarily stopped you to be renewed 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.560
 in the cart already for 3 euros only orally 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.830
 should acquire that take 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.540
 high quality on principle 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 first stop on the clothes 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.170
 yes the hold-rating tube for 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 Ulla or motorcycles 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030
 I got it in the Indian city of Pune Back Mining Ltd 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.190
 actually pretty good on the bike under the party 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.320
 So he wants the hose cart 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.610
 wanted to install 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.020
 then I would be your percent 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.939
 waiting 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.270
 to buy a new gasoline clamp process hose body 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.960
 because we are getting 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 4 see it that way 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.100
 the percent I just can not find anything 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.880
 he might quite simply like to buy better hose clamps in the shop 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.600
 and then very clever did not attack any more as I have the s 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.640
 with winning 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.350
 so how can you cost the hose 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.630
 and that's definitely 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.370
 much better 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.500
 I'm also very happy with denials 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 So I would like to say how it works with the Apple 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 I currently use only individually 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.749
 that is a normal one 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.749
 two bars what you can use for scooters 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.639
 yes, um 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.579
 there are differences and there are 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.219
 Ethical Synthetic and Heinz Synthetic Percent are full 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.969
 then do not report serious 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.259
 Following the tables one can also use pretty ones at the moment 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.890
 but no percentage is allowed on percent 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.459
 partly there are the tables 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.599
 but that by no means I think that's good and 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.810
 then it's just about the power of the engine is synonymous 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.269
 accordingly worse 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.249
 for the mini-shuttle conditions 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.779
 he also gives open 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.929
 occurring questions 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.979
 There should be a very early beginning 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.969
 since he takes the ratio 1 to 25 because you do not 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.969
 40 milliliters now on a stage win 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:09.279
 and even if the pocket-bike retracts 20 milliliters of oil 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.209
 a liter of gas 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.159
 Umarov was to avoid Jan possible engine damage will be safe 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.819
 had a medium to meet 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.289
 after Robben falls so halfway is retracted 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.749
 I would advise 30 milliliters of oil on a liter of gasoline 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.039
 mix like that 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:33.119
 The tent then corresponds to 15 Willich says Hoffenheim liters of gasoline 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.789
 you can easily dynamically bottle 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.539
 read off and then 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.539
 so far, nothing is in the way 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.749
 yes I hope I liked you a video and four give the video one 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.629
 Thumbs up uncommented it 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.579
 positive and maybe even their favorites
