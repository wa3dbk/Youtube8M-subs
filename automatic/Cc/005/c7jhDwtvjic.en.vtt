too many omega-6 fats in our diet and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.240 
too many omega-6 fats in our diet and
not<00:00:50.219> enough<00:00:50.520> omega-3<00:00:51.000> fats<00:00:51.480> remember<00:00:51.930> this

not enough omega-3 fats remember this
omega-3<00:00:53.250> fats<00:00:53.520> help<00:00:53.760> reduce<00:00:54.180> inflammation

well<00:00:58.620> peanuts<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.340> high<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> omega-6<00:01:00.570> fats

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
well peanuts are high in omega-6 fats

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
well peanuts are high in omega-6 fats
they're<00:01:01.649> low<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.010> omega-3<00:01:02.609> fat<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.149> can

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
they're low in omega-3 fat so they can

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
they're low in omega-3 fat so they can
cause<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.719> imbalance<00:01:03.960> ratio<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
cause an imbalance ratio there that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
cause an imbalance ratio there that
really<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> first<00:01:06.630> issues<00:01:07.170> you're

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
going to find with peanuts is that they

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
going to find with peanuts is that they
have<00:01:09.479> too<00:01:09.840> many<00:01:09.960> omega-6<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.979> enough

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
have too many omega-6 is not enough

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
have too many omega-6 is not enough
omega-3s<00:01:12.080> that's<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> first<00:01:13.439> problem<00:01:13.710> with

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
omega-3s that's the first problem with

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
omega-3s that's the first problem with
most<00:01:14.070> peanuts<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.970> second<00:01:15.540> issue<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
most peanuts the second issue is that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.800 
most peanuts the second issue is that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
most peanuts are grown on the ground

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
most peanuts are grown on the ground
they<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.229> very<00:01:19.439> moist<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.159> lot<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> them

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
they get very moist and a lot of them

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.859 
they get very moist and a lot of them
contain<00:01:22.310> mycotoxins<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.460> mold<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
contain mycotoxins or mold and so that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
contain mycotoxins or mold and so that
mold<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> big<00:01:25.920> reasons<00:01:26.070> why<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
mold is one of the big reasons why so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.109

ideally a type of a peanut called a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.500 
ideally a type of a peanut called a
Valencia<00:02:26.840> peanut<00:02:27.170> or<00:02:27.830> jungle<00:02:28.700> peanuts<00:02:29.120> and

Valencia peanut or jungle peanuts and

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.480 
Valencia peanut or jungle peanuts and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
these peanuts are typically not grown in

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.590 
these peanuts are typically not grown in
the<00:02:31.610> moisture<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.090> ground<00:02:32.390> they're

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
the moisture of the ground they're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.690 
the moisture of the ground they're
typically<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.200> bushes<00:02:33.860> off<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.250> ground<00:02:34.490> or

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
typically and bushes off the ground or

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.370 
typically and bushes off the ground or
higher<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.810> that's<00:02:36.020> going<00:02:36.290> to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
higher up and so that's going to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.200 
higher up and so that's going to
eliminate<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.220> issue<00:02:37.460> with<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> mold

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
eliminate that of issue with the mold

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.030 
eliminate that of issue with the mold
and<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:39.440> way<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:39.890> eat
