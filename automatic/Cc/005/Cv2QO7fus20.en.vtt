00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.870 

this<00:00:02.990> bark<00:00:03.260> mulch<00:00:03.470> is<00:00:03.889> really<00:00:04.550> good<00:00:04.700> for

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:04.880 
this bark mulch is really good for

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.519 
this bark mulch is really good for
controlling<00:00:05.270> annual<00:00:05.630> weeds<00:00:05.779> like<00:00:06.200> if<00:00:06.410> you

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
controlling annual weeds like if you

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.070 
controlling annual weeds like if you
have<00:00:06.680> spurge<00:00:07.210> annual<00:00:08.210> bluegrass<00:00:08.420> perhaps

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
have spurge annual bluegrass perhaps

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.930 
have spurge annual bluegrass perhaps
things<00:00:09.590> that<00:00:09.740> just<00:00:09.920> come<00:00:10.070> up<00:00:10.250> one<00:00:10.430> set<00:00:10.700> seed

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
things that just come up one set seed

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.090 
things that just come up one set seed
and<00:00:11.090> then<00:00:11.180> and<00:00:11.420> then<00:00:11.540> you<00:00:12.200> know<00:00:12.320> died<00:00:12.530> there

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
and then and then you know died there

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.710 
and then and then you know died there
it's<00:00:13.280> pretty<00:00:13.640> good<00:00:13.820> because<00:00:14.180> what<00:00:14.300> happens<00:00:14.600> is

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
it's pretty good because what happens is

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.480 
it's pretty good because what happens is
the<00:00:14.900> seeds<00:00:15.140> will<00:00:15.380> land<00:00:15.560> on<00:00:15.680> the<00:00:15.800> mulch<00:00:16.010> the

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
the seeds will land on the mulch the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.700 
the seeds will land on the mulch the
mulch<00:00:16.699> dries<00:00:17.029> out<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.359> then<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.779> seeds<00:00:18.019> they

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
mulch dries out and then the seeds they

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.019 
mulch dries out and then the seeds they
may<00:00:18.919> sprout<00:00:19.220> but<00:00:19.400> then<00:00:19.519> they<00:00:19.609> die<00:00:19.759> because

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
may sprout but then they die because

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.249 
may sprout but then they die because
it's<00:00:20.119> not<00:00:20.210> enough<00:00:20.390> water<00:00:20.570> so<00:00:20.839> that's<00:00:21.079> that's

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
it's not enough water so that's that's

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.919 
it's not enough water so that's that's
usually<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.679> reason<00:00:22.099> for<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:22.579> mulch<00:00:22.929> but

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929 
usually the reason for this mulch but

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.109 
usually the reason for this mulch but
where<00:00:24.079> you<00:00:24.140> have<00:00:24.289> perennial<00:00:24.859> weeds<00:00:25.119> the

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
where you have perennial weeds the

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.239 
where you have perennial weeds the
situation<00:00:26.810> is<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:27.380> they<00:00:27.589> can<00:00:27.769> often<00:00:28.069> push

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
situation is is that they can often push

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.970 
situation is is that they can often push
the<00:00:28.429> much<00:00:28.669> so<00:00:29.179> this<00:00:30.169> fabric<00:00:30.529> mulch<00:00:30.739> is

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
the much so this fabric mulch is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.650 
the much so this fabric mulch is
something<00:00:31.310> that<00:00:31.460> we<00:00:31.909> find<00:00:32.149> works<00:00:32.360> really<00:00:32.540> well

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
something that we find works really well

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.750 
something that we find works really well
for<00:00:32.810> most<00:00:33.110> perennial<00:00:33.560> weeds<00:00:33.680> it's<00:00:33.950> very<00:00:34.340> tough

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
for most perennial weeds it's very tough

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.880 
for most perennial weeds it's very tough
you<00:00:34.940> see<00:00:35.120> if<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:35.360> doesn't<00:00:35.750> have<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:35.900> weave<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.710> it

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
you see if it doesn't have a weave to it

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.070 
you see if it doesn't have a weave to it
because<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.880> ones<00:00:38.060> that<00:00:38.210> have<00:00:38.330> a<00:00:38.360> weave<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.900> it

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
because the ones that have a weave to it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.590 
because the ones that have a weave to it
the<00:00:39.980> weed<00:00:40.760> can<00:00:40.940> just<00:00:41.090> grow<00:00:41.210> right<00:00:41.270> through

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
the weed can just grow right through

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.290 
the weed can just grow right through
that<00:00:41.630> okay<00:00:42.520> so<00:00:43.520> these<00:00:43.640> are<00:00:43.820> these<00:00:43.970> are<00:00:44.030> pretty

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
that okay so these are these are pretty

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.510 
that okay so these are these are pretty
tough<00:00:44.570> what<00:00:45.230> I've<00:00:45.380> done<00:00:45.410> here<00:00:45.710> because<00:00:46.400> you've

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
tough what I've done here because you've

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.030 
tough what I've done here because you've
already<00:00:46.700> planted<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.210> plants<00:00:47.630> is<00:00:47.750> is<00:00:48.500> cut<00:00:48.920> an

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
already planted the plants is is cut an

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.150 
already planted the plants is is cut an
X<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.520> it<00:00:49.640> okay<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.320> it's<00:00:51.590> very<00:00:51.710> important<00:00:52.100> to

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
X in it okay so it's very important to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.250 
X in it okay so it's very important to
have<00:00:52.250> an<00:00:52.430> X<00:00:52.670> as<00:00:53.000> opposed<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.630> a<00:00:53.660> circle<00:00:54.110> and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
have an X as opposed to a circle and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.670 
have an X as opposed to a circle and
I'll<00:00:54.890> show<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.190> reason<00:00:55.490> in<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.670> second<00:00:56.680> so

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
I'll show you the reason in a second so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.230 
I'll show you the reason in a second so
what<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.190> do<00:00:59.440> essentially<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.120> pull<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
what you do essentially you pull the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.890 
what you do essentially you pull the
plant<00:01:02.890> through<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.009> X<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.299> reason<00:01:05.689> the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
plant through this X now the reason the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.620 
plant through this X now the reason the
X<00:01:06.050> is<00:01:06.260> important<00:01:06.800> is<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.280> allows<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.210> put

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
X is important is that allows you to put

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.510 
X is important is that allows you to put
the<00:01:08.870> mulch<00:01:09.680> as<00:01:10.010> close<00:01:10.460> up<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.280> shrub<00:01:13.280> as

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
the mulch as close up to the shrub as

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.310 
the mulch as close up to the shrub as
you<00:01:13.640> can<00:01:13.880> okay<00:01:14.570> because<00:01:14.750> every<00:01:14.930> time<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.140> have

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
you can okay because every time you have

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.350 
you can okay because every time you have
a<00:01:15.350> space<00:01:15.650> that's<00:01:16.130> an<00:01:16.340> opportunity<00:01:16.610> for<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.210> weed

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
a space that's an opportunity for a weed

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.990 
a space that's an opportunity for a weed
to<00:01:17.510> grow<00:01:17.659> through<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.040> want<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.430> reduce

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
to grow through so you want to reduce

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.090 
to grow through so you want to reduce
the<00:01:20.180> amount<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.510> spaces<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:22.070> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
the amount of spaces that the that the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.310 
the amount of spaces that the that the
fabric<00:01:22.370> mulch<00:01:22.700> isn't<00:01:23.030> covering<00:01:23.330> okay<00:01:24.260> so

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
fabric mulch isn't covering okay so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.170 
fabric mulch isn't covering okay so
there<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.620> go<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.950> don't<00:01:25.100> have<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.430> dig<00:01:26.000> out

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
there you go you don't have to dig out

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.850 
there you go you don't have to dig out
anything<00:01:26.659> for<00:01:26.810> your<00:01:26.870> plant<00:01:27.170> goes<00:01:27.590> right<00:01:27.830> over

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
anything for your plant goes right over

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.690 
anything for your plant goes right over
the<00:01:28.130> top<00:01:28.630> like<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.950> what<00:01:31.159> you<00:01:31.310> do<00:01:31.490> is

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the top like that then what you do is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.610 
the top like that then what you do is
you<00:01:32.210> take<00:01:32.240> your<00:01:32.450> bark<00:01:32.870> mulch<00:01:33.110> or<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.440> could

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
you take your bark mulch or you could

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.050 
you take your bark mulch or you could
use<00:01:33.650> rocks<00:01:34.190> also<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.000> put<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.020> down<00:01:36.460> yeah

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.360 

this<00:01:41.060> much<00:01:41.470> isn't<00:01:42.470> really<00:01:42.710> for<00:01:42.920> keeping<00:01:43.190> out

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
this much isn't really for keeping out

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.750 
this much isn't really for keeping out
weeds<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:45.020> really<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.560> protect<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.280> fabric

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
weeds it's really to protect the fabric

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.750 
weeds it's really to protect the fabric
the<00:01:47.180> fabric<00:01:47.890> even<00:01:48.890> though<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.040> might<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.610> an

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
the fabric even though it might have an

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.570 
the fabric even though it might have an
ultraviolet<00:01:50.479> light<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.930> sunlight<00:01:51.580> inhibitor

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
ultraviolet light the sunlight inhibitor

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.210 
ultraviolet light the sunlight inhibitor
in<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.210> will<00:01:53.720> break<00:01:53.990> down<00:01:54.049> over<00:01:54.500> time<00:01:54.680> if

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
in it it will break down over time if

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.859 
in it it will break down over time if
