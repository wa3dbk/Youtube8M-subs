00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
is kind of important you want to go over

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
is kind of important you want to go over
over<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.069> want<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> anvil<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> fall<00:02:09.030> over

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
over the you want the anvil to fall over

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.059 
over the you want the anvil to fall over
them

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
them

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.759 
them
the<00:02:10.759> latter<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.930> let's<00:02:12.110> just<00:02:12.290> build<00:02:12.409> this<00:02:12.590> up

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
the latter so let's just build this up

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.940 
the latter so let's just build this up
here<00:02:13.629> how<00:02:14.629> many<00:02:14.689> did<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.079> build<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.439> up<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.739> like

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
here how many did I build it up I like

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920 
here how many did I build it up I like
having<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.579> that<00:02:16.969> height<00:02:17.209> one<00:02:17.420> two<00:02:17.599> three

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
having it that that height one two three

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.270 
having it that that height one two three
blocks<00:02:18.079> up<00:02:18.469> so<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.299> then<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
blocks up so just like that and then the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.179 
blocks up so just like that and then the
descend<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> UH<00:02:23.560> what's<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.650> cold<00:02:24.890> where<00:02:25.099> is

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
descend the UH what's a cold where is

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.220 
descend the UH what's a cold where is
this<00:02:25.370> thing

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this thing

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.339 
this thing
sticky<00:02:27.230> piston<00:02:27.819> put<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:29.480> there<00:02:29.840> for

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
sticky piston put that right there for

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.339 
sticky piston put that right there for
sure<00:02:31.090> yep<00:02:32.090> that's<00:02:32.540> how<00:02:32.689> it's<00:02:32.780> gonna<00:02:32.840> go<00:02:33.019> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
sure yep that's how it's gonna go and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.770 
sure yep that's how it's gonna go and
then<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.430> basically<00:02:34.670> stack<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.359> angles<00:02:35.599> up

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
then you basically stack the angles up

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.819 
then you basically stack the angles up
here<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.930> way<00:02:39.109> that<00:02:39.139> you<00:02:39.379> pushed

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
here and then the way that you pushed

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.210 
here and then the way that you pushed
this<00:02:40.099> out<00:02:40.840> actually<00:02:41.840> that's<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.560> how<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.799> goes

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
this out actually that's not how it goes

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.479 
this out actually that's not how it goes
actually<00:02:43.549> yes<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:43.909> but<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> end<00:02:44.810> goes<00:02:45.489> yeah

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
actually yes it is but the end goes yeah

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.440 
actually yes it is but the end goes yeah
no<00:02:46.639> that's<00:02:46.790> not<00:02:46.970> how<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.209> is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
no that's not how it is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.170 
no that's not how it is
you<00:02:47.780> put<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.139> one<00:02:48.319> one<00:02:48.739> more<00:02:48.950> back<00:02:49.129> like<00:02:50.000> that

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
you put this one one more back like that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.699 
you put this one one more back like that
and<00:02:51.970> then<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.150> way<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.359> want<00:02:53.689> the<00:02:53.959> piston<00:02:54.620> to

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
and then the way you want the piston to

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.860 
and then the way you want the piston to
pulse<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.400> need<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.790> make<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.299> pulse

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
pulse is you need to make a pulse

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.500 
pulse is you need to make a pulse
limiter<00:02:57.220> over<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.489> it's<00:02:58.639> rather<00:02:58.819> easy<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.239> do

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
limiter over here it's rather easy to do

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.649 
limiter over here it's rather easy to do
just<00:03:00.290> put<00:03:00.500> down<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.709> redstone<00:03:01.189> block<00:03:01.489> piece<00:03:02.419> of

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
just put down a redstone block piece of

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.909 
just put down a redstone block piece of
redstone<00:03:02.930> right<00:03:03.829> there<00:03:05.079> um<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.139> forget<00:03:06.709> is<00:03:06.889> it

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
redstone right there um I forget is it

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.129 
redstone right there um I forget is it
this<00:03:07.159> one<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.519> longest<00:03:07.790> tick<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.329> I'm

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
this one to the longest tick it's I'm

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.729 
this one to the longest tick it's I'm
suck<00:03:09.439> I'm<00:03:09.889> just<00:03:10.129> go<00:03:10.250> check<00:03:11.500> shortest<00:03:12.500> tick

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
suck I'm just go check shortest tick

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.020 
suck I'm just go check shortest tick
longest<00:03:13.340> -<00:03:13.489> all<00:03:13.700> right<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:15.760> essentially<00:03:16.760> what

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
longest - all right and essentially what

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.319 
longest - all right and essentially what
you're<00:03:17.209> gonna<00:03:17.329> do<00:03:17.599> is<00:03:17.870> hook<00:03:18.229> up<00:03:18.409> whatever

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
you're gonna do is hook up whatever

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.729 
you're gonna do is hook up whatever
whatever<00:03:20.329> redstone<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.989> had<00:03:21.169> going<00:03:21.379> over

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
whatever redstone you had going over

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.009 
whatever redstone you had going over
here<00:03:22.540> through<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.659> block<00:03:25.629> so<00:03:26.629> it<00:03:26.690> turns<00:03:26.900> it

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
here through this block so it turns it

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.670 
here through this block so it turns it
off<00:03:27.109> and<00:03:28.269> then<00:03:29.269> this<00:03:29.449> goes<00:03:29.659> into<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:30.049> hold<00:03:30.500> on

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
off and then this goes into this hold on

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:40.770 
off and then this goes into this hold on
I<00:03:31.510> um<00:03:35.500> yes<00:03:38.199> kind<00:03:39.199> of<00:03:39.379> goofed<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:40.099> little<00:03:40.489> bit

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
I um yes kind of goofed a little bit

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I um yes kind of goofed a little bit
this<00:03:41.780> needs<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.199> go<00:03:42.879> into<00:03:43.879> this

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
this needs to go into this

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.050 
this needs to go into this
like<00:03:46.490> that<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.900> go<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:49.520> we're<00:03:49.640> fine

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
like that there you go so we're fine

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.050 
like that there you go so we're fine
and<00:03:50.990> basically<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.470> discussed<00:03:51.860> this<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.460> put

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
and basically you discussed this and put

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.840 
and basically you discussed this and put
a<00:03:53.090> lever<00:03:53.630> button<00:03:54.350> whatever<00:03:54.710> source<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.490> power

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
a lever button whatever source of power

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.090 
a lever button whatever source of power
you<00:03:56.210> want<00:03:56.360> down<00:03:56.630> here<00:03:57.610> oops<00:03:58.610> it's<00:03:59.270> not<00:03:59.480> Weaver

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
you want down here oops it's not Weaver

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.710 
you want down here oops it's not Weaver
grab<00:04:01.100> some<00:04:01.280> TNT<00:04:03.250> pop<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.460> in<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.730> dispensers

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
grab some TNT pop it in the dispensers

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.920 
grab some TNT pop it in the dispensers
and<00:04:06.340> we<00:04:07.340> should<00:04:07.700> be<00:04:07.910> good<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.150> go

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
and we should be good to go

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.620 
and we should be good to go
actually<00:04:10.600> let's<00:04:11.600> check<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.900> out<00:04:13.480> hope<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
actually let's check it out hope this

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.430 
actually let's check it out hope this
works<00:04:14.750> out<00:04:14.960> I<00:04:16.720> didn't<00:04:17.720> even<00:04:17.840> go<00:04:18.049> off<00:04:18.080> what

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
works out I didn't even go off what

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.210 
works out I didn't even go off what
happened<00:04:18.830> oopsie<00:04:19.370> doops<00:04:20.140> yeah<00:04:21.140> yeah<00:04:23.980> there<00:04:24.980> we

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
happened oopsie doops yeah yeah there we

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.660 
happened oopsie doops yeah yeah there we
go<00:04:25.750> alright<00:04:26.750> there<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.530> an<00:04:27.650> anvil<00:04:27.920> cannon<00:04:28.460> and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
go alright there is an anvil cannon and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.280 
go alright there is an anvil cannon and
the<00:04:29.090> thing<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.390> it's<00:04:29.510> going<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.840> land<00:04:30.020> here

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
the thing is it's going to land here

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.650 
the thing is it's going to land here
every<00:04:30.680> single<00:04:31.070> time<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.580> think<00:04:32.150> until<00:04:32.600> you

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
every single time I think until you

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.860 
every single time I think until you
start<00:04:32.990> moving<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:34.270> repeaters<00:04:35.270> timings

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
start moving the the repeaters timings

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.060 
start moving the the repeaters timings
around<00:04:36.170> better<00:04:37.130> than<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.790> mean<00:04:39.070> pretty
