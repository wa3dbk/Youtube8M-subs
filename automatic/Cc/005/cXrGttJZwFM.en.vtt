00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.660
 about the few people know what you do 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.250

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.650
 proportions large continue in our 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.300
 can afford health in germany 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.939
 known the german oak famous 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.560
 German old colleagues describe what 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.779
 and calibrate all or calibrate with 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.580
 but what happened is what interests me 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.440
 the oak leaves are the same 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.440
 Everyone can pick themselves a little 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.519
 own initiative asks oak leaves 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.839
 contain a very effective sector 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.570
 the real memory weakness around 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.340
 against osteoporosis the active ingredient of 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.120
 oak leaves leads the body increasingly 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.520
 cold to the train 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.800
 Of course, I'm still not rising and you 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.449
 can avoid osteoporosis or one 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.899
 emerged from the break to a standstill 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 bring 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.730
 oak leaves are also used for 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.890
 conjunctivitis for a unilateral 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.660
 conjunctivitis still at least 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 contribute incontinence you can yes 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.530
 still with a childbearing are used 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.880
 what you should not do if you are 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.330
 we get 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.149
 how am I doing such an old one 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.770
 leafing for me is easy 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.280
 once fresh oak leaves still too 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.960
 to notice 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.710
 The tea must be fresh leaves 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.679
 the fresh leaves are made 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.929
 The rich man in the flow text leaves 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.090

 water one leaves the oak the 15 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.840
 Minutes attract most of us 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.659
 herbal 10 needs ktv and three 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.240

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.740
 consumption 15 minutes after 15 minutes 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.939
 all the tannins outside them 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.189
 whole flavonoid 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.729
 what they contain are short team 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.689
 which are patents and other active ingredients 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.700
 then in the water 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.840
 when I'm drinking that old rail 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.310
 is total osteoporosis arthrosis for 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.599
 men and women of menopause is 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.340
 you do not just see the women 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.500
 men themselves are also affected by many 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.810
 people where I recommended as leaves 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.019
 have and also vitamin d3 against brose 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.590
 the bones are dissolved in the foot 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.590
 lack of nutrients 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.319
 What are the characteristics of the leaves? 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.000
 Plate are have a 110 large effect 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.760
 means they pull together they are 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.870
 together again 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.260
 confirmations antiphlogistika one the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 floristry and means to prevent them 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.709
 there can be no inflammations 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.540
 Inflammations in the body therefore understand 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.190
 so if you are so in charge you have to 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.800
 not necessarily first pharmacy visit 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.610
 him for a few years 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.770
 comply 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.239
 first filled three games looks 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.220
 the signal is the new bone 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.800
 arises and then heard a body 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.190
 minerals and also makes a sign 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.290
