missile enters the EMP UAV zone it will
detonate<00:02:40.290> rather<00:02:40.860> than<00:02:41.099> impacting<00:02:41.730> and

detonate rather than impacting and
killing<00:02:42.299> your<00:02:42.390> team<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:43.379> also<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.739> good

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
killing your team it's also a good

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.380 
killing your team it's also a good
practice<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.519> give<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:44.910> team<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
commander mode is about more than just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.240 
commander mode is about more than just
endlessly<00:02:57.329> spamming<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.019> UAV<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.980> about

endlessly spamming the UAV it's about

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.789 
endlessly spamming the UAV it's about
timing<00:02:59.639> knowing<00:03:00.630> not<00:03:00.810> only<00:03:00.840> where<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.560> use

timing knowing not only where to use
