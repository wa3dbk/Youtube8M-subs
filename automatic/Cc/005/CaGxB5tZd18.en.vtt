okay power pack is on is check the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.800 
okay power pack is on is check the
voltage<00:03:03.860> 13-point<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.980> down<00:03:08.810> let's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
voltage 13-point and is going down let's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:25.460 
voltage 13-point and is going down let's
see<00:03:10.110> what<00:03:10.290> happens
