this is a finding the goddamn mushrooms
now<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.630> my<00:00:24.869> game<00:00:25.109> or

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
now I don't know if it was my game or

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.099 
now I don't know if it was my game or
just<00:00:26.730> my<00:00:26.880> generate<00:00:27.269> world<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:28.019> just

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
just my generate world or that's just

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.120 
just my generate world or that's just
how<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.680> general<00:00:29.010> though<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:31.009> tended<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
how it is in general though I tended to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.830 
how it is in general though I tended to
find<00:00:32.460> you're<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.820> need<00:00:33.000> purple<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.660> brown

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
find you're gonna need purple and brown

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.160 
find you're gonna need purple and brown
mushroom<00:00:34.260> no<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> normal<00:00:36.600> color<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
mushroom no I think the normal color is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
mushroom no I think the normal color is
yellow<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:40.160> yellow<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.309> brown<00:00:41.670> i<00:00:41.730> believe<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
yellow and yellow and brown i believe it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
yellow and yellow and brown i believe it

pack<00:00:54.110> now<00:00:55.110> red<00:00:55.590> mushrooms<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.329> had

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
pack now red mushrooms for me I had

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.849 
pack now red mushrooms for me I had
found<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:57.960> easier<00:00:58.350> underground<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.430> uh

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
found them easier underground and uh

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
found them easier underground and uh
brown<00:01:01.859> mushrooms<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> find<00:01:02.969> pretty<00:01:03.180> much

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
brown mushrooms you can find pretty much

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.560 
brown mushrooms you can find pretty much
anywhere<00:01:03.769> these<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> look<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.580> tend<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
anywhere these have to look I tend to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
anywhere these have to look I tend to
find<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:07.020> close<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.740> trees<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.520> slow

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
find them close to trees that will slow

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.690 
find them close to trees that will slow
you<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.290> keep<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.560> mind<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.490> check

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you down keep that in mind so just check

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
you down keep that in mind so just check
Chi<00:01:12.030> trees<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> underground<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> deep

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
Chi trees and underground like a deep

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
Chi trees and underground like a deep
underground<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.060> edges<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> entrances

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
underground and the edges of entrances

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
underground and the edges of entrances
of<00:01:16.439> caves<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.490> order<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> find<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:20.330> don't

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
of caves in order to find it I don't

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.910 
of caves in order to find it I don't
think<00:01:21.479> there's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> specific<00:01:21.900> column<00:01:22.619> Graham

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
think there's a specific column Graham

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.499 
think there's a specific column Graham
you<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> should<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.700> let<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you know I should just let this look it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
you know I should just let this look it
up<00:01:24.570> anyway<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.860> should<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.100> done<00:01:26.280> this

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
up anyway actually should have done this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.539 
up anyway actually should have done this
before<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.880> tutorials<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:28.170> Dooley<00:01:28.549> alright

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
before I do tutorials but Dooley alright

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.780 
before I do tutorials but Dooley alright
got<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> details<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.770> mushrooms<00:01:31.770> grow<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
got the details on mushrooms grow and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
got the details on mushrooms grow and
very<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.600> places<00:01:34.409> where<00:01:34.530> there's<00:01:34.680> very<00:01:34.950> little

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
very in places where there's very little

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.149 
very in places where there's very little
light<00:01:35.540> very<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.869> natural<00:01:37.140> light<00:01:37.650> such<00:01:38.130> as

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
light very little natural light such as

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
light very little natural light such as
sunlight<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.079> find<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
sunlight so just you can find the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.300 
sunlight so just you can find the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
Thunder trees in cave entrances imaging
caves<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.880> general<00:01:45.259> down<00:01:46.259> near<00:01:46.530> lava<00:01:46.829> I've

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
