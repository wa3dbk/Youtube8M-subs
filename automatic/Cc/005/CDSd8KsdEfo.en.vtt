700<00:00:16.049> d<00:00:16.199> which<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.470> obviously<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> canon<00:00:17.190> DSLR

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
700 d which is obviously a canon DSLR

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.240 
700 d which is obviously a canon DSLR
and<00:00:18.119> basically<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.230> obviously<00:00:19.859> with

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and basically with that obviously with

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.450 
and basically with that obviously with
the<00:00:20.369> 700d<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> STM<00:00:21.930> technology<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the 700d get the STM technology with the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.870 
the 700d get the STM technology with the
autofocus<00:00:24.060> built<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.439> video<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
autofocus built in for video which is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.660 
autofocus built in for video which is
very<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.210> quiet<00:00:28.099> because<00:00:29.099> obviously<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
very very quiet because obviously it's a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.640 
very very quiet because obviously it's a
solid<00:00:30.060> motor<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.960> basically<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:31.560> going

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
solid motor so basically what I'm going

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
solid motor so basically what I'm going
to<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.250> video<00:00:32.520> today<00:00:32.969> guys<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.510> give

to do in this video today guys is give
you<00:00:33.809> guys<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.410> overview<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you guys a bit of an overview of the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
you guys a bit of an overview of the
general<00:00:35.790> auto<00:00:36.180> focusing<00:00:36.989> obviously<00:00:37.950> you've

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
general auto focusing obviously you've

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.319 
general auto focusing obviously you've
went<00:00:38.190> better<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.910> video<00:00:39.030> because

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
went better here on this video because

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
went better here on this video because
it<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.629> silent<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> few

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it is silent but we can use a few

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
it is silent but we can use a few
products<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> camera

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
products to go in and out of the camera

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.470 
products to go in and out of the camera
you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.980> probably<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> put<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.000> hand<00:00:45.210> up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you can probably see if I put my hand up

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.080 
you can probably see if I put my hand up
the<00:00:46.050> background<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.980> video<00:00:47.250> may<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the background of this video may go a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
the background of this video may go a
little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.570> blurry<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.770> they'll<00:00:49.860> actually

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
little bit blurry and they'll actually

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
little bit blurry and they'll actually
focus<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:50.820> hand<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.420> come<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
focus in on my hand when we come back to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.420 
focus in on my hand when we come back to
my<00:00:51.930> face<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.219> back

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
my face as you can see it will go back

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.119 
my face as you can see it will go back
it's<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> fastest<00:00:54.930> auto<00:00:55.170> focusing<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it's not the fastest auto focusing in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's not the fastest auto focusing in
the<00:00:56.280> world<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> camcorder<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> phone

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the world like a camcorder or a phone

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.040 
the world like a camcorder or a phone
maybe<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.640> far<00:00:59.850> as<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> DSLR<00:01:00.510> goes<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
maybe but as far as a DSLR goes this is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
maybe but as far as a DSLR goes this is
a<00:01:01.079> major<00:01:01.410> improvement<00:01:01.890> than<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> fact<00:01:02.550> it's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
a major improvement than the fact it's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
a major improvement than the fact it's
silent<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.690> makes<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> even<00:01:04.110> better<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
silent just makes it even better on the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.640 
silent just makes it even better on the
600<00:01:05.309> D<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> six<00:01:06.330> other<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:07.320> sure<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
600 D and the six other not sure on the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
600 D and the six other not sure on the
650<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.659> noisy

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
650 I think it was a little bit noisy

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.899 
650 I think it was a little bit noisy
and<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> bit<00:01:10.680> off-putting<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> for

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and it's a bit off-putting to use it for

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
and it's a bit off-putting to use it for
video<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.869> we're<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.380> guys

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
so basically I'm just going to drop this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
so basically I'm just going to drop this
product<00:01:28.470> into<00:01:28.680> view<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> guys<00:01:29.460> could<00:01:29.640> see

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
product into view and you guys could see

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.640 
product into view and you guys could see
the<00:01:29.970> autofocus<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.900> action<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> there<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> go

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the autofocus in action so there you go

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530 
the autofocus in action so there you go
then<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> saw<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:36.030> takes<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
then if you saw that it takes a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
then if you saw that it takes a
literally<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:37.110> half<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.650> second<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
literally probably half a second to a
