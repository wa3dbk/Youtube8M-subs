 control b agree once this comes out 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.260
 which is to justly look for a 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.370
 group of words what you have to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.370
 to do is just look for this sv back 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.340

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.950
 low back you give to look for next and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.590
 you will come out here in agreement what you do 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.050
 it's exactly where he puts a 1 wolf rice 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.769
 and you put a 0 now close the file 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.800
 you give to save and this part will already be 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.660
 list you have already the hack put is worth a 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.260
 Once this is done, we can start 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.760
 the game remind you that this does not work 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.760
 in the online 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.580
 gives you error they are worth and even if you are the host 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.250
 I was trying and at least 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.920
 it has not worked for me to tell you too 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.409
 that this can only be done I think that in 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.090
 the destination with the updated game 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.440
 good thing is that I have the game of 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.010
 stigma so I've done it with the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 steam game 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.080
 and what we do is go to 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.420
 individual because as I tell you only 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.420
 it works in individual and you get into 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.220
 dit ops arcade 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.360
 that is where the mod is going to be 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.950
 everything we have been doing 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.910
 and the truth is that this is quite 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.880
 pimp is very is very handsome is to see it in 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.740
 first person or it's like it's 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.380
 because a map in the first person is 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.360
 pretty cool and good nothing I leave you 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.330
 there will be a video so you can 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.820

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.760

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.710
 available weapons in our hands not 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.990
 I know if they will kill us I will test yes if we 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.440
 kill is worth it so we do not have a model 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.600
 agree if you want to have a mod 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.340
 you have a hack in the previous video of 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.770
 agreement on how to put capital 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.850

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.840

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.180

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.149
 third person by pressing control you can 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:06.360

 mod that is quite currado and also 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.629
 it's good that you have an option to 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.979
 change of weapon as you are seeing is 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.080
