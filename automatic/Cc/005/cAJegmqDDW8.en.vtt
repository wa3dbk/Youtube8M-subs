00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
so this is the first boot in the crypt

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.500 
so this is the first boot in the crypt
online<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> kr2<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.680> 98<00:00:29.609> flex

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
online the kr2 now this is a 98 flex

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.470 
online the kr2 now this is a 98 flex
boot<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> about<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> 98<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.430> boot<00:00:32.700> right

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
boot which is about a 98 with boot right

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.030 
boot which is about a 98 with boot right
that's<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> narrowest<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> boot

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
that's about the narrowest the boot

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's about the narrowest the boot
comes<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.489> than<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> full-blown<00:00:36.149> race<00:00:36.360> boot

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
comes other than a full-blown race boot

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
comes other than a full-blown race boot
absolutely<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.700> tight
