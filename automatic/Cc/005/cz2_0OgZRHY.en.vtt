00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
but it is a question I can learn from

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.190 
but it is a question I can learn from
because<00:03:07.359> like<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.450> said<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.900> running<00:03:09.170> a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
because like I said I was running a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.460 
because like I said I was running a
little<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.739> little<00:03:10.130> bit<00:03:10.310> too<00:03:10.430> fast<00:03:10.670> them<00:03:10.910> just

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
little a little bit too fast them just

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.699 
little a little bit too fast them just
it<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.590> necessary<00:03:13.160> in<00:03:13.760> an<00:03:14.000> urban<00:03:14.359> area<00:03:14.720> where

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
it is necessary in an urban area where

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.160 
it is necessary in an urban area where
all<00:03:16.069> kinds<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.670> stuff<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.060> happen<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.690> all

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
all kinds of stuff can happen and all

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
kinds of stuff can be um on the relative

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.280 
kinds of stuff can be um on the relative
it's<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.430> good<00:03:22.609> learning<00:03:23.600> moments<00:03:24.170> for

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
it's a it's a good learning moments for

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.970 
it's a it's a good learning moments for
