I'm Mike McConville from Horizon hobby

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.020 
I'm Mike McConville from Horizon hobby
and<00:00:10.170> today<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:10.860> we've<00:00:11.010> done<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.490> taken<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
and today what we've done is taken a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.950 
and today what we've done is taken a
couple<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.480> our<00:00:12.719> parks<00:00:13.530> own<00:00:13.650> airplanes<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
couple of our parks own airplanes and

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.170 
couple of our parks own airplanes and
installed<00:00:15.960> 636<00:00:16.830> open<00:00:17.220> stock<00:00:17.430> receivers<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
installed 636 open stock receivers and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.870 
installed 636 open stock receivers and
configured<00:00:18.630> them<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.369> s3x

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
configured them so that we have a s3x

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.970 
configured them so that we have a s3x
mode<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.420> also<00:00:21.930> set<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.529> mode<00:00:22.740> where

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
mode and also set up a mode where

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.230 
mode and also set up a mode where
there's<00:00:23.189> no<00:00:23.369> as3x

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
there's no as3x

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.939 
there's no as3x
and<00:00:24.570> then<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.840> brought<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> bunch<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> pilots

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and then we brought in a bunch of pilots

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.310 
and then we brought in a bunch of pilots
to<00:00:26.070> experience<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> airplanes<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.480> as3x

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to experience the airplanes with as3x

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:39.540 
to experience the airplanes with as3x
and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:28.859> without<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> s3x

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.390 

now<00:00:40.550> on

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200 

huh<00:00:44.700> what's<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> first<00:00:45.630> thing<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.960> notice

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
huh what's the first thing you notice

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.840 
huh what's the first thing you notice
what<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.750> stable

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
what more stable

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
what more stable
well<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:50.970> definitely<00:00:51.120> much<00:00:51.480> smoother<00:00:51.930> as

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
well it's definitely much smoother as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
well it's definitely much smoother as
soon<00:00:53.130> as<00:00:53.220> he<00:00:53.310> turned<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.790> noticed<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
soon as he turned it on I noticed a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.390 
soon as he turned it on I noticed a
difference<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.740> don't<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> coordinate

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
difference you don't have to coordinate

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.490 
difference you don't have to coordinate
as<00:00:56.730> much<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.450> just<00:00:57.690> made<00:00:57.870> me<00:00:58.020> better<00:00:58.200> than<00:00:58.290> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
as much it's just made me better than I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.479 
as much it's just made me better than I
am<00:00:58.650> playing<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.850> makes<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.270> good<00:01:01.489> s3x

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
am playing so it makes you look good s3x

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.450 
am playing so it makes you look good s3x
made<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.360> smooth<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.650> easy<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.190> felt

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
made that really smooth and easy I felt

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
made that really smooth and easy I felt
like<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.729> didn't<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.120> do<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:11.960> yeah

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
like I didn't have to do it yeah

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
like I didn't have to do it yeah
seemed<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.710> before<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.759> when<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> tried

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
seemed like before I would when I tried

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.730 
seemed like before I would when I tried
to<00:01:15.950> turn<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.880> Dover<00:01:18.270> crack<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.590> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to turn my Dover crack because it was so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.020 
to turn my Dover crack because it was so
quick<00:01:20.750> now<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.960> as3x<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.369> control<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
quick now with as3x on I can control a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
quick now with as3x on I can control a
lot<00:01:24.360> better<00:01:24.660> if<00:01:25.410> you<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> takes<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.340> coupla

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
lot better if you will it takes a coupla

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.430 
lot better if you will it takes a coupla
now<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.940> help<00:01:27.300> smooth<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> Coakley<00:01:28.290> now

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
now to help smooth the Coakley now

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.170 
now to help smooth the Coakley now
exactly<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> reduces<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.940> work

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
exactly with it and it reduces a work

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.840 
exactly with it and it reduces a work
world<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.890> lot<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> times<00:01:32.610> that's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
world and that's a lot of times that's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.150 
world and that's a lot of times that's
what<00:01:33.150> differentiates<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:34.110> good<00:01:34.320> power<00:01:34.619> from<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
what differentiates a good power from a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.460 
what differentiates a good power from a
really<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.700> power<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.300> how<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.290> manage

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
really good power is how you can manage

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.080 
really good power is how you can manage
work<00:01:37.800> board<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:43.460> feels<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.700> flies<00:01:44.820> with

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
work board I feels like it flies with

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.559 
work board I feels like it flies with
you<00:01:45.119> apart<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.310> makes<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.819> makes<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> feel

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
you apart it just makes it makes it feel

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.969 
you apart it just makes it makes it feel
like<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> better<00:01:48.929> plane<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like a better plane that's all it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.139 
like a better plane that's all it
doesn't<00:01:50.220> feel<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.640> fighting<00:01:50.940> me<00:01:51.030> or

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
doesn't feel like it's fighting me or

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.120 
doesn't feel like it's fighting me or
anything<00:01:51.300> like<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.679> just<00:01:52.679> feels<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.069> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
anything like that just feels like a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.480 
anything like that just feels like a
bigger<00:01:53.819> heavier<00:01:54.179> more<00:01:54.750> expensive<00:01:55.170> plane<00:01:55.490> your

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
bigger heavier more expensive plane your

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.010 
bigger heavier more expensive plane your
ex<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.729> good<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.030> beginner<00:01:57.240> through<00:01:57.450> expert<00:01:57.929> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
without having the plane flip over on

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.820 
without having the plane flip over on
yes<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:09.090> still<00:02:09.600> feel<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.289> control<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
yes I still feel like I'm in control the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.070 
yes I still feel like I'm in control the
plane<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.940> move<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> stick<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> little

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
plane but if I move the stick a little

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.980 
plane but if I move the stick a little
too<00:02:13.290> much<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.010> then<00:02:15.000> let<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.569> let<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.780> settle

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
too much and then let just let it settle

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.809 
too much and then let just let it settle
down<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.440> settles<00:02:16.770> down<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.069> its<00:02:17.220> own<00:02:17.370> instead

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
down it settles down on its own instead

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.390 
down it settles down on its own instead
of<00:02:18.110> instead<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> me<00:02:19.560> having<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.890> make<00:02:20.100> another

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
of instead of me having to make another

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.949 
of instead of me having to make another
correction<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.030> maybe<00:02:21.209> over<00:02:21.510> correcting

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
correction and maybe over correcting

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.550 
correction and maybe over correcting
again<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.560> when<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.800> get<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.010> trouble

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
again and that's when you get in trouble

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:34.059 
again and that's when you get in trouble
I<00:02:29.020> felt<00:02:30.020> very<00:02:30.140> twitchy<00:02:30.530> at<00:02:30.920> first<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:33.069> when

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
I felt very twitchy at first and when

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.910 
I felt very twitchy at first and when
the<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.640> s3x<00:02:35.270> was<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:36.170> felt<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:36.709> things

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the a s3x was on it felt like things

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.070 
the a s3x was on it felt like things
were<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.160> smoothing<00:02:37.940> right<00:02:38.270> out<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.930> think

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
were just smoothing right out I think

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.840 
were just smoothing right out I think
that's<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.470> best<00:02:39.620> I've<00:02:39.770> ever<00:02:39.860> flown<00:02:40.250> over<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that's the best I've ever flown over the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.000 
that's the best I've ever flown over the
five<00:02:41.510> times<00:02:41.780> I've<00:02:41.989> flown<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.530> really<00:02:42.739> yeah

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
five times I've flown is it really yeah

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
five times I've flown is it really yeah
that<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:44.750> cool
