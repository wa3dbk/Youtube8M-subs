00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this way you search your library for a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.340 
this way you search your library for a
basic<00:00:53.070> land<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.760> forest<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> forest

get<00:03:26.500> into<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.800> state<00:03:27.130> where<00:03:27.160> you're<00:03:27.370> just

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
get into a state where you're just

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.550 
get into a state where you're just
swaying<00:03:27.760> 46<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.540> have<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.720> keep<00:03:28.840> jumping

swaying 46 and I have to keep jumping
chump<00:03:30.220> blocking<00:03:31.000> eventually<00:03:31.570> he's<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:31.870> to

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
chump blocking eventually he's going to

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.050 
chump blocking eventually he's going to
get<00:03:32.080> through<00:03:32.320> so<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.860> think<00:03:33.519> of<00:03:33.820> two

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
get through so I think of two

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.610 
get through so I think of two
two-and-a-half<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.900> about<00:03:35.140> right<00:03:35.320> for<00:03:35.500> him

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
two-and-a-half is about right for him

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.560 
two-and-a-half is about right for him
loaded<00:03:36.070> yeah<00:03:36.310> we'll<00:03:36.580> see<00:03:36.760> we'll<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.060> what

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
loaded yeah we'll see we'll see what

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.910 
loaded yeah we'll see we'll see what
kind<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:37.780> use<00:03:37.930> he<00:03:38.080> gets<00:03:38.230> unlimited<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:38.890> I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
kind of use he gets unlimited but I

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.170 
kind of use he gets unlimited but I
don't<00:03:39.190> think<00:03:39.310> standard<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:39.880> going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> be

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
don't think standard is going to be

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.330 
don't think standard is going to be
