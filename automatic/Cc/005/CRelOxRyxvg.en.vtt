or there's an attack chopper you gain
the<00:00:53.699> proper<00:00:54.239> position<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.020> shooting

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the proper position so you're shooting

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
the proper position so you're shooting
down<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.219> can't<00:00:56.489> hit<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
down on them and they can't hit the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
down on them and they can't hit the
broadside<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> barn<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.930> seems<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> be

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
broadside of the barn that seems to be

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
broadside of the barn that seems to be
my<00:00:58.620> luck<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.520> other<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.390> I'm

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
my luck the other one is when I'm

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.849 
my luck the other one is when I'm
actually<00:01:00.719> gunning<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.410> somebody<00:01:01.710> about

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
actually gunning for somebody about

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.969 
actually gunning for somebody about
ninety-five<00:01:02.579> percent<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.180> time<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.799> pilot<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
ninety-five percent of time the pilot is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
ninety-five percent of time the pilot is
worse<00:01:05.460> than<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.720> don't<00:01:06.750> know

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
worse than me and they really don't know

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
worse than me and they really don't know
what<00:01:07.200> they're<00:01:07.350> doing<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.130> means<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.880> might

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
what they're doing which means we might

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
what they're doing which means we might
get<00:01:09.270> two<00:01:09.479> kills<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.590> positioned<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
get two kills get out positioned and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
get two kills get out positioned and
just<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.119> destroyed<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:12.810> completely

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
just get destroyed which completely

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
just get destroyed which completely
wastes<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> chopper<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.460> here's<00:01:14.700> my<00:01:14.850> thought

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
wastes the chopper so here's my thought

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
wastes the chopper so here's my thought
process<00:01:15.540> I'm<00:01:15.689> thinking<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.170> starting<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> bi

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
process I'm thinking of starting up a bi

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.910 
process I'm thinking of starting up a bi
weekly<00:01:17.310> series<00:01:17.850> where<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.600> find<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.320> good<00:01:19.619> gunner

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
weekly series where I find a good gunner

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
weekly series where I find a good gunner
and<00:01:20.189> pilot<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> rotate<00:01:21.509> back<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.960> forth

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and pilot and we rotate back and forth

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
and pilot and we rotate back and forth
what<00:01:23.040> would<00:01:23.220> make<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.640> different<00:01:23.939> from

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
what would make this different from

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600 
what would make this different from
other<00:01:24.450> people<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.920> flashes<00:01:26.490> in
