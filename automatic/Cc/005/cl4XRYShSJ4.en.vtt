00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
with a clamp as well so this clamp has a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
with a clamp as well so this clamp has a
quarter<00:01:33.780> twenty<00:01:34.049> thread<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
quarter twenty thread on it I'm going to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
quarter twenty thread on it I'm going to
unscrew<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.270> real

unscrew this here so you can see it real

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.770 
unscrew this here so you can see it real
quick<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> there's<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> quarter<00:01:39.270> twenty<00:01:39.540> thread

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
quick so there's a quarter twenty thread

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
quick so there's a quarter twenty thread
on<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> shaft<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.400> clamp

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
on this shaft right here this this clamp

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
on this shaft right here this this clamp
goes<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.899> five-eighths<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> an<00:01:43.590> inch<00:01:43.710> all

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
goes from five-eighths of an inch all

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.380 
goes from five-eighths of an inch all
the<00:01:44.009> way<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> inch<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.880> three-quarter<00:01:45.149> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the way up to inch and three-quarter so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.060 
the way up to inch and three-quarter so
it'll<00:01:45.540> fit<00:01:45.689> every<00:01:46.049> tripod<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.890> there

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it'll fit every tripod that's out there

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.889 
it'll fit every tripod that's out there
are<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> legs<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.670> any<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.909> stuff<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.659> has

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
are the legs or any of that stuff it has

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
are the legs or any of that stuff it has
rubber<00:01:49.229> clamping<00:01:49.710> pads<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> inside<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
rubber clamping pads on the inside so it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370 
rubber clamping pads on the inside so it
clamps<00:01:51.180> nicely<00:01:51.570> even<00:01:51.720> though<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> round

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
clamps nicely even though it's a round

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.149 
clamps nicely even though it's a round
rail<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.770> clamps<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.399> nicely<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
rail it clamps really nicely to it a

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.410 
rail it clamps really nicely to it a
couple<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.340> other<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> happens<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
couple of other things this happens to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.139 
couple of other things this happens to
be<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.780> samsung<00:01:58.560> phone<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.430> you<00:02:00.000> can

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
be a samsung phone and I you can

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
be a samsung phone and I you can
probably<00:02:00.360> tell<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> camera<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.439> covered

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
probably tell that the camera is covered

probably tell that the camera is covered
up<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.070> well<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> way<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.820> works<00:02:03.030> these

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
up here well the way this works these

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.420 
up here well the way this works these
arms<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.320> able<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.950> slide<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
no big deal slide the arm to the sides

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.969 
no big deal slide the arm to the sides
of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> year<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.629> your<00:02:10.020> camera<00:02:10.619> clear
