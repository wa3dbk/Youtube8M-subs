00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
more also I'll be able to start off I'm

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.080

not<00:02:55.799> being<00:02:56.040> able<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.879> start

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
not being able to I'm going to start

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.240 
not being able to I'm going to start
offloading<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.510> lot<00:02:57.810> more<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.349> machinima<00:02:58.889> so

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
offloading a lot more to machinima so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.099 
offloading a lot more to machinima so
you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.459> see<00:02:59.670> me<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.819> respawn<00:03:00.480> I'm<00:03:00.750> hoping

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
you can see me on respawn I'm hoping

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.110 
you can see me on respawn I'm hoping
about<00:03:01.379> three<00:03:01.650> oh<00:03:01.829> it's<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.159> triple<00:03:02.459> kill<00:03:02.609> Wow

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
about three oh it's a triple kill Wow

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.819 
about three oh it's a triple kill Wow
so<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> reckon<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.989> lot<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.139> commentary<00:03:04.590> but

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
so I reckon it's a lot of commentary but

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.830 
so I reckon it's a lot of commentary but
um<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.459> could<00:03:05.609> also<00:03:05.760> see<00:03:06.060> me<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.239> respawn<00:03:06.810> a

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
that's basically it for that with the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.400 
that's basically it for that with the
Bayesian<00:04:33.080> Canadian<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.919> uh<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:35.240> think<00:04:36.020> is

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
Bayesian Canadian and uh I think is

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.540 
Bayesian Canadian and uh I think is
there<00:04:36.530> anything<00:04:36.740> else<00:04:36.949> really<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.370> want

I know that we had stopped uploading a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.749 
I know that we had stopped uploading a
lot<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.500> parts<00:04:52.250> from<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.520> that's

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
lot of the parts from that that's

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.820 
lot of the parts from that that's
because<00:04:53.090> Mitch<00:04:53.479> went<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:53.930> oh<00:04:54.110> shit<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.620> don't

drop<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.099> edge<00:04:55.220> that's<00:04:55.729> because<00:04:56.150> Mitch<00:04:56.509> went

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
drop the edge that's because Mitch went

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.260

think<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.400> don't<00:05:22.639> think<00:05:22.789> it<00:05:22.940> floated<00:05:23.210> every

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
think I don't think it floated every

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.060 
think I don't think it floated every
episode<00:05:23.780> but<00:05:23.870> they<00:05:23.990> uploaded<00:05:24.349> a<00:05:24.470> lot<00:05:24.770> of<00:05:24.919> them

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
episode but they uploaded a lot of them

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.500 
episode but they uploaded a lot of them
from<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.460> because<00:05:25.909> they<00:05:26.090> were<00:05:26.150> able<00:05:26.360> to

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
from it because they were able to

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.659 
from it because they were able to
because<00:05:26.840> they<00:05:27.470> were<00:05:27.530> not<00:05:27.680> moving<00:05:27.979> so

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
because they were not moving so

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.250
