Ivan at my slim turned on in a while but
I'm<00:04:17.470> I've<00:04:18.040> been<00:04:18.220> wondering<00:04:18.670> lately<00:04:18.700> if<00:04:19.390> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
I'm I've been wondering lately if the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.130 
I'm I've been wondering lately if the
operating<00:04:20.680> system<00:04:20.980> runs<00:04:21.190> better<00:04:21.489> on<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.790> slim

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
operating system runs better on the slim

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.410
