00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
the blade up and then I went up a couple

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.970 
the blade up and then I went up a couple
millimeters<00:04:52.580> like<00:04:53.150> scooping<00:04:53.630> out<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:54.740> this

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
millimeters like scooping out in this

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.950 
millimeters like scooping out in this
motion<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.900> then<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:57.020> put<00:04:57.230> on<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.500> zero<00:04:58.250> guard

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
motion and then I put on the zero guard

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.690 
motion and then I put on the zero guard
is<00:05:00.550> 1/16<00:05:01.550> inch<00:05:02.590> with<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.620> blade<00:05:03.980> down<00:05:04.280> and

is 1/16 inch with the blade down and

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.390 
is 1/16 inch with the blade down and
then<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:06.440> know<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.620> went<00:05:06.860> up<00:05:06.950> a<00:05:07.040> little<00:05:07.190> bit

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
then I you know I went up a little bit

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.450 
then I you know I went up a little bit
higher<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:08.390> then<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.660> put<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.020> guard<00:05:09.260> up<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:09.800> I

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
higher and then I put the guard up and I

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.130 
higher and then I put the guard up and I
went<00:05:10.700> up<00:05:10.820> a<00:05:10.880> little<00:05:11.000> bit<00:05:11.240> higher<00:05:11.450> at<00:05:11.930> this

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
went up a little bit higher at this

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.160 
went up a little bit higher at this
angle<00:05:12.640> and<00:05:13.640> scooping<00:05:14.210> up<00:05:14.390> like<00:05:14.630> cutting<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.140> a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
angle and scooping up like cutting in a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.680 
angle and scooping up like cutting in a
little<00:05:15.500> bit<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.860> scooping<00:05:16.310> up<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.700> outward

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
little bit and scooping up and outward

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:24.340 
little bit and scooping up and outward
and<00:05:18.410> then<00:05:18.890> I<00:05:18.920> did<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:20.110> I<00:05:22.720> did<00:05:23.720> that<00:05:23.750> mix<00:05:24.140> with

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
and then I did that I did that mix with

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.250 
and then I did that I did that mix with
the<00:05:24.530> one<00:05:24.770> guard<00:05:25.510> with<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.630> blade<00:05:26.840> all<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.140> way

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
the one guard with the blade all the way

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.370 
the one guard with the blade all the way
down<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.150> same<00:05:29.390> thing<00:05:29.750> just<00:05:30.020> scooping

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
down and the same thing just scooping

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.950 
down and the same thing just scooping
out<00:05:30.560> at<00:05:30.920> this<00:05:31.130> angle<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.850> little<00:05:32.270> bit<00:05:32.600> higher

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
out at this angle a little bit higher

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.810 
out at this angle a little bit higher
just<00:05:33.410> going<00:05:33.890> up<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.100> little<00:05:34.250> bit<00:05:34.430> higher<00:05:34.610> like<00:05:34.760> a

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
just going up a little bit higher like a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.880 
just going up a little bit higher like a
millimeter<00:05:35.360> or<00:05:35.510> two<00:05:35.720> with<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.650> blade

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
millimeter or two with the blade

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.060 
millimeter or two with the blade
scooping<00:05:37.520> each<00:05:37.730> time<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.210> increment<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:39.070> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
scooping each time you increment the the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.780 
scooping each time you increment the the
guards<00:05:40.430> upward<00:05:40.910> and<00:05:41.090> then<00:05:41.750> you<00:05:41.900> do<00:05:42.080> that<00:05:42.790> until

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
guards upward and then you do that until

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.750 
guards upward and then you do that until
it<00:05:44.210> starts<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.630> blend<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.560> then<00:05:46.490> what<00:05:46.670> I've

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
it starts to blend and then what I've

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.820 
it starts to blend and then what I've
had<00:05:46.970> been<00:05:47.240> because<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:48.020> picked<00:05:48.230> the<00:05:48.320> court<00:05:48.650> the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
had been because I picked the court the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.690 
had been because I picked the court the
blade<00:05:49.070> with<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.750> push<00:05:50.750> up<00:05:51.100> and<00:05:52.100> then<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.490> just

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
blade with the push up and then I just

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:03.680 
blade with the push up and then I just
use<00:05:52.910> the<00:05:53.030> corner<00:05:53.450> like<00:05:54.320> this<00:05:54.910> to<00:05:57.670> do<00:05:58.670> blending

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.180 

he's<00:06:04.690> going<00:06:04.990> up<00:06:05.200> a<00:06:05.290> little<00:06:05.470> bit<00:06:05.620> at<00:06:05.740> each<00:06:05.889> time

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
he's going up a little bit at each time

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.150 
he's going up a little bit at each time
and<00:06:06.520> then<00:06:06.610> checking<00:06:06.940> it<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.770> all<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:08.950> views

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
and then checking it and all the views

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.550 
and then checking it and all the views
details<00:06:09.760> are<00:06:09.880> on<00:06:09.910> my<00:06:10.180> on<00:06:10.450> my<00:06:10.570> side<00:06:10.840> taper<00:06:11.139> video

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
details are on my on my side taper video

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.590 
details are on my on my side taper video
like<00:06:11.800> in<00:06:12.010> way<00:06:12.190> detail<00:06:12.880> I<00:06:12.910> got<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.210> whole<00:06:13.389> video

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
like in way detail I got a whole video

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.640 
like in way detail I got a whole video
on<00:06:13.810> how<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.139> taper<00:06:14.470> the<00:06:14.650> size<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:17.110> then<00:06:17.320> I<00:06:17.440> put

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
on how I taper the size and then I put

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.170 
on how I taper the size and then I put
the<00:06:17.740> blade<00:06:18.010> down<00:06:18.660> to<00:06:19.660> do<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.970> you<00:06:21.970> know<00:06:22.120> to

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
the blade down to do the you know to

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.820 
the blade down to do the you know to
blend<00:06:22.480> it<00:06:22.630> in<00:06:22.750> a<00:06:22.780> little<00:06:22.900> bit<00:06:23.200> more<00:06:23.380> thick<00:06:23.680> if

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
blend it in a little bit more thick if

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.890 
blend it in a little bit more thick if
you<00:06:23.919> see<00:06:24.100> some<00:06:24.310> some<00:06:25.030> parts<00:06:25.360> that<00:06:25.419> are<00:06:25.540> dark

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
you see some some parts that are dark

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.860 
you see some some parts that are dark
and<00:06:26.230> not<00:06:27.220> blended<00:06:27.700> in<00:06:27.850> you<00:06:27.880> use<00:06:28.210> that<00:06:28.389> corner

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
and not blended in you use that corner

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.530 
and not blended in you use that corner
and<00:06:29.110> you<00:06:29.320> just<00:06:29.470> hit<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:30.850> can<00:06:31.000> see<00:06:31.150> it<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.389> little

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
and you just hit you can see it a little

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.290 
and you just hit you can see it a little
bit<00:06:31.840> at<00:06:32.620> a<00:06:32.650> time<00:06:32.740> like<00:06:33.190> that<00:06:33.220> so<00:06:33.880> now<00:06:34.060> we're<00:06:34.240> all
