have<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.049> put<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.319> together<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
have to do is put it together now we

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.919 
have to do is put it together now we
don't<00:01:35.039> have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.789> know<00:01:35.819> it's<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.420> ever

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
don't have to you know it's gonna ever

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.779 
don't have to you know it's gonna ever
yeah<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.889> think<00:01:38.009> these<00:01:38.130> things<00:01:38.310> are<00:01:38.429> gonna<00:01:38.520> flow

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
yeah I think these things are gonna flow

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.760 
yeah I think these things are gonna flow
maybe<00:01:39.210> should<00:01:39.689> try<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.929> out<00:01:40.049> yeah<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.409> throw<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
maybe should try it out yeah we throw in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.889 
maybe should try it out yeah we throw in
it<00:01:40.889> any<00:01:41.340> bets<00:01:41.609> head<00:01:41.999> slop<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.479> always<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.749> head

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it any bets head slop we always do head

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.629 
it any bets head slop we always do head

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
slaps I say sink float eventually it'll

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.179 
slaps I say sink float eventually it'll
sink<00:01:47.939> come<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.630> baby<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.950> wouldn't

with instructions what do we need those

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.459 
with instructions what do we need those
for<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.109> be<00:02:01.229> easy

done this for all of our dogs nuke
mojado<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.990> buy<00:02:07.139> it<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.619> think<00:02:08.429> we're<00:02:08.520> gonna

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
mojado just buy it I think we're gonna

mojado just buy it I think we're gonna
see<00:02:08.910> some<00:02:08.940> major<00:02:09.539> progress<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.380> very

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
see some major progress which is very

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710 
see some major progress which is very
unusual<00:02:11.100> here<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.940> would<00:02:12.060> take<00:02:12.240> us<00:02:12.450> two<00:02:12.690> days

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
unusual here it would take us two days

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.090 
unusual here it would take us two days
to<00:02:13.050> build<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.350> stuff<00:02:13.560> we're<00:02:13.770> gonna<00:02:13.860> have

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
to build this stuff we're gonna have

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.380 
to build this stuff we're gonna have
together<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.580> probably<00:02:14.790> 15<00:02:15.240> minutes

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
together in probably 15 minutes

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.500 
together in probably 15 minutes
hopefully<00:02:15.900> try<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.490> what<00:02:18.390> is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
hopefully try to get that in what is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.110 
hopefully try to get that in what is
going<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:19.140> why<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.740> these<00:02:19.980> wider<00:02:20.790> than

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
going on here why are these wider than

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.060 
going on here why are these wider than
our<00:02:21.210> dog<00:02:21.440> that's<00:02:22.440> not<00:02:22.620> right

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
our dog that's not right

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.550 
our dog that's not right
started<00:02:23.460> putting<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.730> together<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:25.290> seems

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
started putting it together and it seems

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.920 
started putting it together and it seems
like<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.340> couple<00:02:26.820> inches<00:02:26.970> too<00:02:27.300> wide<00:02:27.570> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
like it's a couple inches too wide I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.390 
like it's a couple inches too wide I
guess<00:02:28.200> what<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.470> could<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:28.860> sell<00:02:29.130> top

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
guess what we could do is sell top

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
guess what we could do is sell top
screws<00:02:29.730> into<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.690> potentially<00:02:30.990> have

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
screws into this do we potentially have

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.120 
screws into this do we potentially have
this<00:02:31.440> upside<00:02:31.770> down

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
this upside down

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.550 
this upside down
maybe<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.300> don't<00:02:33.780> think<00:02:33.930> these<00:02:34.020> two<00:02:34.080> things<00:02:34.410> go

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
maybe I don't think these two things go

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.200 
maybe I don't think these two things go
together<00:02:34.620> oh<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.160> excited<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.790> thing<00:02:36.030> I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
together oh so excited for this thing I

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.760 
together oh so excited for this thing I
thought<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.600> just<00:02:36.630> slot<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.170> together<00:02:37.440> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
thought we just slot it together and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.310 
thought we just slot it together and
it'd<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> water<00:02:38.520> minutes<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.480> of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
it'd be in the water minutes and of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080 
it'd be in the water minutes and of
course<00:02:40.590> that's<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> way<00:02:41.250> sometimes<00:02:41.910> it's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
course that's not the way sometimes it's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
course that's not the way sometimes it's
like<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.360> world<00:02:42.570> eights<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.440> might

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
like the world eights you what we might

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800 
like the world eights you what we might
need<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.830> do<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.220> put<00:02:44.370> wood<00:02:44.520> decking<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.450> top<00:02:45.660> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
need to do is put wood decking on top of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.970 
need to do is put wood decking on top of
this<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> only<00:02:46.290> way<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.800> I'm

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
this it's the only way to do it I'm

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.380 
this it's the only way to do it I'm
going<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.190> start<00:02:47.520> cutting<00:02:47.640> boards<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.270> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
going to start cutting boards this is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
going to start cutting boards this is
turning<00:02:48.630> into<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.990> little<00:02:49.170> bit<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> DIY

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
turning into a little bit of a DIY

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
turning into a little bit of a DIY
project<00:02:50.340> now<00:02:50.790> we're<00:02:50.970> cutting<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.540> bolting

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
project now we're cutting and bolting

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.560 
project now we're cutting and bolting
and<00:02:52.500> all<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.310> stuff<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.240> one<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.450> those

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and all that stuff so it's one of those

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.600 
and all that stuff so it's one of those
first<00:02:54.870> world<00:02:55.170> problem<00:02:55.560> situations<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.370> oh

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
first world problem situations right oh

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.420 
first world problem situations right oh
my<00:02:57.330> dog<00:02:57.660> doesn't<00:02:58.110> work<00:02:58.320> why<00:02:59.040> don't<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.250> just

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
my dog doesn't work why don't we just

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.550 
my dog doesn't work why don't we just
let<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> lay<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.390> top<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.900> rails<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.380> got

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
let it lay on top of the rails it's got

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.350 
let it lay on top of the rails it's got
the<00:03:01.680> grippy<00:03:02.040> surface<00:03:02.490> which<00:03:02.880> i<00:03:03.030> think<00:03:03.090> is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the grippy surface which i think is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.760 
the grippy surface which i think is
probably<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.870> most<00:03:03.990> important<00:03:04.410> thing<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.650> all

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
probably the most important thing of all

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.560 
probably the most important thing of all
this<00:03:04.980> stuff<00:03:05.250> what<00:03:05.490> we<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.880> do<00:03:06.030> was<00:03:06.330> take

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
this stuff what we have to do was take

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.600 
this stuff what we have to do was take
some<00:03:06.780> boards<00:03:07.230> block<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.770> up<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.040> bit<00:03:08.250> lay

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
some boards block it up a little bit lay

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.220 
some boards block it up a little bit lay
it<00:03:08.730> back<00:03:08.850> down<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.600> feeling<00:03:09.810> good<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.140> me

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
it back down this is feeling good to me

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.510 
it back down this is feeling good to me
I<00:03:10.290> think<00:03:10.380> we<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.620> make<00:03:10.740> this<00:03:10.860> work<00:03:11.070> let's<00:03:11.340> bang

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
I think we can make this work let's bang

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.800 
I think we can make this work let's bang
all<00:03:11.670> three<00:03:11.850> should<00:03:12.060> probably<00:03:12.240> put<00:03:12.480> those<00:03:12.600> on

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
all three should probably put those on

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.210 
all three should probably put those on
put<00:03:13.080> them<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> four<00:03:13.560> corners<00:03:13.710> we<00:03:14.100> got

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
put them on the four corners we got

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.250 
put them on the four corners we got
three<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.430> those<00:03:14.780> if<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.140> actually

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
three of those if you have to actually

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.410 
three of those if you have to actually
get<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> out<00:03:16.800> into<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.250> water<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:17.730> build<00:03:18.300> this

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
get it out into the water and build this

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.570 
get it out into the water and build this
bar<00:03:18.630> underwater<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.890> think<00:03:20.130> we<00:03:20.280> were<00:03:20.340> both

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
bar underwater so I think we were both

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.000 
bar underwater so I think we were both
in<00:03:20.850> Pleasant<00:03:21.540> denial<00:03:21.840> about<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.260> fact<00:03:22.710> but

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
in Pleasant denial about that fact but

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.470 
in Pleasant denial about that fact but
pretty<00:03:23.280> soon<00:03:23.340> we're<00:03:23.760> gonna<00:03:23.820> be<00:03:23.940> getting<00:03:24.240> wet
