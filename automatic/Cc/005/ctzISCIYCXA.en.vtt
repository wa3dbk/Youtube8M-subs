00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.810 
protein now in between meals a lot of
times<00:00:32.790> I'll<00:00:33.030> supplement<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> shakes

times I'll supplement a lot of shakes
nitro<00:00:35.820> tech<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.270> course<00:00:36.890> leading<00:00:37.890> into<00:00:38.160> my

nitro tech and of course leading into my

nitro tech and of course leading into my
work<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.700> some<00:00:38.969> might<00:00:39.149> consume<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> little

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
work out some might consume a little

work out some might consume a little
more<00:00:40.200> carbohydrates<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> usually<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
more carbohydrates and and usually the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
more carbohydrates and and usually the
cell<00:00:42.180> type<00:00:42.360> product<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:43.530> I've<00:00:43.680> taken<00:00:43.890> since

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
cell type product which I've taken since

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590 
cell type product which I've taken since
the<00:00:44.250> beginning<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> something<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the beginning is something a lot of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.440 
the beginning is something a lot of
people<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:46.020> post-training<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.360> found<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
people use post-training I found the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.850 
people use post-training I found the
benefits<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.079> cell<00:00:49.440> takes<00:00:49.590> several

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
benefits of using cell takes several

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
benefits of using cell takes several
times<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> day<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.760> actually<00:00:51.030> take<00:00:51.360> Celtic

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
times a day I actually take Celtic

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.439 
times a day I actually take Celtic
probably<00:00:52.199> three<00:00:52.469> times<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.860> day<00:00:53.239> usually<00:00:54.239> in

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
probably three times a day usually in

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.750 
probably three times a day usually in
between<00:00:54.899> meals<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.260> might<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.559> add<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.949> into<00:00:56.520> my

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
between meals I might not add it into my

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
between meals I might not add it into my
meals<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.449> taking<00:00:57.750> enough<00:00:57.960> protein

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
meals because I'm taking enough protein

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
meals because I'm taking enough protein
and<00:00:58.440> carbohydrates<00:00:59.010> through<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> day<00:00:59.520> just

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and carbohydrates through the day just

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
and carbohydrates through the day just
like<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> might<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> nitro<00:01:01.289> tech<00:01:01.440> shake<00:01:01.829> in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
like I might have a nitro tech shake in

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.709 
like I might have a nitro tech shake in
between<00:01:02.370> meals<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> give<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.420> body<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
between meals just to give my body to

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.179 
between meals just to give my body to
extra<00:01:04.049> boost<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.589> depends<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.070> my

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
extra boost it really depends on my

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.969 
extra boost it really depends on my
schedule<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:06.360> i<00:01:06.420> always<00:01:06.689> carry<00:01:07.110> nitro<00:01:07.799> tech

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
schedule but i always carry nitro tech

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.300 
schedule but i always carry nitro tech
with<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.090> travel<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> also<00:01:10.409> take<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
with me when i travel and also take a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
with me when i travel and also take a
cup<00:01:11.549> full<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> cell<00:01:12.060> tech<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.780> great<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.140> me

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
cup full of cell tech it's great for me

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
cup full of cell tech it's great for me
