00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
 on television 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.559
 recipe buoys that more me 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.929
 they like it's a spatter and it splashed 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.670
 we gave a variety a tantita a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 small little variety first that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.439
 nothing will tell you to wear a beef skirt 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 We have already said many times the skirt 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.380
 of times one is the hard meat does not dry 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 of the near universe then already what 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.160
 we explained last week we're going to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.990
 cut the cons and I say in favor of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 thread or how it comes and here what 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 we can see here is raw and this is 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.370
 easier to eat what she wanted and I 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.320
 the short one like that is going 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.969
 to happen that the meat will be harder 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.340
 on the other hand if I cut it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 in this way they see that it is simple a lot 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 easier let's put it to cook in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.199
 Cold water provided from cold water 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 haha and this is the proper knife is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.570
 an avocado but vix to our two 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 big how much time 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 approximately that is to say a piece of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.600
 onion piece of onion and a garlic I'm not going 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.720
 to urinate but real is another 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.720
 knife 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.490
 I have a pressure cooker if I am 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.750
 lucky and I have it 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 this is not 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 if I have a prison stadium for this 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.190
 list as in the 30 40 minutes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.260
 in this way covered lightly as 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.450
 we have also here our our 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.649
 this 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.140
 sharp in our video we will take a while 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.840
 to take less time if we leave towards 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.789
 open to evaporate the water then 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.009
 let's take a little longer this hair from 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.780
 preference to skin leave a small 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.319
 slit so that the air is circulating 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.470

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.009
