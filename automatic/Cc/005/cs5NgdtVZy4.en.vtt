00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hello sir 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.160
 Modest Tastes from the video recipes section 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.120
 in this section we have a beautiful sherbet sweet recipe 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.800
 "Cup Basti" 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.080
 But let's take a look at the ingredients first if you want 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 2 eggs 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 1 bowl of yogurt 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.480
 1 tbsp butter 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.040
 1 packet of baking powder 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.280
 1 flick salt 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.960
 as much flour as possible 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.840
 and fry oil 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 for sherbet; 1.5 cup powdered sugar 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.080
 2 cups of water 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.640
 and a few drops of lemon juice 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.240
 we now know the necessary materials for the cups 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.160
 first we can go to the fire to make the sherbet 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.120
 first we have 1.5 cups of sugar, we leave it 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.720
 add 2 cups of water 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.480
 opening fire 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.080
 we are mixing 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.440
 Wait until boiling 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.440
 continue to boil 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.880
 we also knead dough 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.400
 We said we have two eggs. 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 let's break them first 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.160
 adding our yogurt 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 we're beating like this 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.400
 so much 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.680
 we throw too little salt, we know a flick, 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 Let's add some flour 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 bake 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 and add the butter we soften at room temperature 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.360
 and then start to knead by adding the flour and then mixing with the fingertips 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 will not be a very hard dough 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.880
 it just has to be so sticky 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 this is our consistency 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.560
 Now let's put it aside and wait for 10 minutes 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.640
 Let's close the lemon and sherbet 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.840
 sherbet began to boil 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.680
 we have said a few drops of lemon, let him add 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.560
 shorten and let out after 5 minutes 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.120
 10 minutes later 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.560
 we had a cutter, our dough was played 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 pine 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 and dough into 2 pieces 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.960
 I fix ... 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.280
 let's open so not too thin 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.560
 we're not going to open it as thin as we say, half a inch 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.320
 cut a small tea cup round with mouth 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.240
 we hit the cup, we'll collect the ones from the edges 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.240
 and the other pulp will do the same 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.400
 Let's go to fry them now 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.440
 we put the pot on fire 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.240
 I prefer a small pot for a deep fry 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.640
 our oil will not be very angry, just warm up 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.640
 and 1 finger up fat 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.920
 our oil is warmed, we release our dough to hot oil 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.120
 this process makes the dough more beautiful 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.720
 two sides of our cups rose gold 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.720
 If you are aware I have closed the fire 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.880
 oil should not be too hot 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.320
 in the meantime we will throw the new cold will cool 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.920
 We burn our new cups without burning the fire 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 we will burn the fire later 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.320
 egg 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.440
 we can burn the fire now 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.040
 cups blushed, warm 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.080
 our sherbet is cold, now we will throw it 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.920
 We will wait 6-7 minutes 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.920
 then we will serve 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.600
 our time is up, it was like a sherbet 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 now it's time to serve 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.320
 We shared a nice sherbet recipe in the kitchen of Modest Tastes 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.440
 "Cup Basti" 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.440
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.800
 goodbye...
