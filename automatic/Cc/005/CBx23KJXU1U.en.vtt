00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
of the world map which to be honest I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
of the world map which to be honest I
think<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.130> looks<00:00:23.279> better<00:00:23.519> than<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> original

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
think it looks better than the original

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.570 
think it looks better than the original
Skyrim<00:00:25.230> map<00:00:25.439> where<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:25.949> off<00:00:26.070> reading<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
Skyrim map where it's off reading and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
Skyrim map where it's off reading and
stuffing<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.029> looks<00:00:27.269> more<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.840> don't<00:00:28.590> know

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
stuffing this looks more I don't know

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620

it's<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.670> friendly<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.449> about

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it's more what friendly you think about

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
it's more what friendly you think about
it<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.109> you've<00:00:31.260> got<00:00:31.289> map<00:00:31.700> you've<00:00:32.700> got

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it because now you've got map you've got

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.660 
it because now you've got map you've got
map<00:00:33.390> instead<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.989> using<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:35.100> kind<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> 3d

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

the vanilla tweet version now I can see

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.520 
the vanilla tweet version now I can see
a<00:03:19.560> difference<00:03:19.790> straightaway<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.319> this<00:03:22.319> is

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
a difference straightaway and this is

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.899 
a difference straightaway and this is
really<00:03:22.709> good<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.159> like<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> salt<00:03:23.580> change

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
really good if you like a salt change

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.780 
really good if you like a salt change
rather<00:03:24.629> than<00:03:24.750> something<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:25.379> extreme<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.099> it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
rather than something so extreme and it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.020 
rather than something so extreme and it
removes<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.840> awkward<00:03:28.319> if<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:29.190> stunts<00:03:29.790> of

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
removes the awkward if like stunts of

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.880 
removes the awkward if like stunts of
the<00:03:30.120> male<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.379> apparently<00:03:31.379> according<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.799> the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
the male of apparently according to the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
the male of apparently according to the
mothers<00:03:32.159> page<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.269> does<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.569> by<00:03:33.629> pushing

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
mothers page and it does this by pushing

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.589 
mothers page and it does this by pushing
the<00:03:34.349> shoulders<00:03:34.799> forward<00:03:35.250> slightly<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:36.000> by

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
the shoulders forward slightly and by

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.860 
the shoulders forward slightly and by
raising<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.140> shoulders<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.790> think<00:03:39.750> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
raising the shoulders and I think it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.390 
raising the shoulders and I think it
looks<00:03:40.019> better<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.470> vanilla<00:03:40.709> for<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:41.280> way

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
looks better in the vanilla for that way

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.559 
looks better in the vanilla for that way
it<00:03:41.489> looks<00:03:41.640> better<00:03:41.790> than<00:03:41.849> vanilla<00:03:42.209> for<00:03:42.390> sure

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
it looks better than vanilla for sure

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.449 
it looks better than vanilla for sure
and<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.500> soon<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.830> stop<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.310> this

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
and as soon as you stop it in this

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.720 
and as soon as you stop it in this
year's<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.959> think<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.680> really<00:03:46.920> cool<00:03:47.099> here

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
year's and I think it's really cool here

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.670 
year's and I think it's really cool here

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
we have the ounce folded animation and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.660 
we have the ounce folded animation and
it'll<00:03:52.680> expand<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.189> arms<00:03:53.430> hanging<00:03:53.580> down

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
it'll expand in the arms hanging down

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.030 
it'll expand in the arms hanging down
side<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.200> could<00:03:55.379> be<00:03:55.500> walking<00:03:55.860> down<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
side so you could be walking down the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.270 
side so you could be walking down the
street<00:03:56.129> or<00:03:56.670> running<00:03:57.030> stop<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.290> your

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
like this is a good mod so let's move on

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.050 
like this is a good mod so let's move on
to<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> next<00:04:09.959> animation<00:04:10.459> now<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:11.670> one<00:04:11.879> is

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
to the next animation now this one is

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.660 
to the next animation now this one is
called<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.689> examine<00:04:13.230> animation<00:04:13.860> now<00:04:14.400> of

called the examine animation now of

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.699 
called the examine animation now of
course<00:04:14.879> this<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.420> animated<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.590> can

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
course this is animated and as you can

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.430 
course this is animated and as you can
clearly<00:04:16.769> see<00:04:17.100> arms<00:04:17.790> will<00:04:17.970> drop

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
clearly see arms will drop

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.920 
clearly see arms will drop
and<00:04:18.560> then<00:04:18.709> raised<00:04:18.920> again<00:04:19.250> over<00:04:19.549> time<00:04:19.790> so<00:04:20.690> for

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
and then raised again over time so for

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.570 
and then raised again over time so for
example<00:04:21.440> he's<00:04:22.040> over<00:04:22.370> here

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
example he's over here

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.200 
example he's over here
examining<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.210> tree<00:04:23.480> on<00:04:23.600> his<00:04:23.720> ass<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.940> looks

examining a tree on his ass and it looks

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.800 
examining a tree on his ass and it looks
plausible

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
plausible

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.320 
plausible
it<00:04:26.960> looks<00:04:27.110> legit<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.580> last<00:04:28.760> one<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.270> to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
it looks legit and the last one is to

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.360 
it looks legit and the last one is to
steal<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.960> idol<00:04:30.140> which<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.890> also<00:04:31.070> being

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
suits more like a mage I'd say because

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.270 
suits more like a mage I'd say because
you<00:04:37.700> can<00:04:37.850> see<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.120> magical<00:04:38.660> guy<00:04:39.160> pondering<00:04:40.160> over

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
got straight into it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.370 
got straight into it
overall<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.640> think<00:04:46.820> all<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.300> these<00:04:47.600> agree<00:04:48.050> but

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
overall I think all of these agree but

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.710 
overall I think all of these agree but
