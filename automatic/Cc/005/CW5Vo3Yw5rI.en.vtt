when you remove it make sure you put
that<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.670> separate<00:01:57.119> pile<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:57.869> one

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that a separate pile so there's one

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.830

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.120 
can hold a good charge even after you
remove<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> battery<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:20.120> several<00:02:20.510> days<00:02:21.130> so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
remove the battery for several days so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.230 
remove the battery for several days so
you're<00:02:22.370> gonna<00:02:22.460> need<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.730> make<00:02:22.970> sure<00:02:23.000> you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
you're gonna need to make sure you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.950 
you're gonna need to make sure you
discharge<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.140> before<00:02:25.010> continuing<00:02:25.960> okay

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
discharge this before continuing okay

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:37.170 
discharge this before continuing okay
let's<00:02:27.410> go<00:02:27.620> ahead<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:27.950> remove<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.760> LCD<00:02:32.000> plate

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.300 

we<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.360> second<00:02:39.050> clamp<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.770> need<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.070> flip

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
we have a second clamp we need to flip

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.510 
we have a second clamp we need to flip
up<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.780> again<00:02:42.050> be<00:02:42.230> careful<00:02:42.680> when<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.890> do<00:02:43.010> that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.610

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
okay we're going to flip up both of the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.740 
okay we're going to flip up both of the
clamps<00:02:59.630> we<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.890> here<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.850> clamp<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.270> CCD

and<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.350> clamp<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:04.010> lens<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:05.240> we're

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
and the clamp to the lens and we're

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.000 
and the clamp to the lens and we're
going<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.600> release<00:03:06.080> these<00:03:06.320> cables

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.770

de-solder here I'll show you how to do

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.280 
de-solder here I'll show you how to do
that<00:03:54.700> if<00:03:55.700> you're<00:03:56.209> replacing<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.989> board

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
that if you're replacing the board

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.970 
that if you're replacing the board
you're<00:03:58.040> gonna<00:03:58.129> need<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.519> disorder<00:03:59.060> these

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
you're gonna need to disorder these

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.750 
you're gonna need to disorder these
speaker<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.340> microphone<00:04:01.849> wires<00:04:02.389> here<00:04:03.760> okay

we have a nice clean desalter and all

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.259 
we have a nice clean desalter and all
three<00:04:08.599> terminals<00:04:09.459> our<00:04:10.459> next<00:04:10.849> step<00:04:11.060> is<00:04:11.239> to

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
three terminals our next step is to

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.460 
three terminals our next step is to
dissolve<00:04:11.840> in<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:12.170> bridge<00:04:12.470> here<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.049> do

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
dissolve in this bridge here so to do

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.250 
dissolve in this bridge here so to do
that<00:04:16.269> we're<00:04:17.269> going<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.570> go<00:04:17.690> ahead<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.079> apply

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
that we're going to go ahead and apply

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:31.070 
that we're going to go ahead and apply
some<00:04:18.650> flux<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.789> bridge<00:04:23.030> area

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.890 

I'm<00:04:32.080> going<00:04:32.259> to<00:04:32.319> go<00:04:32.470> ahead<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.830> clean<00:04:33.900> I'm

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.689 

clean<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.270> tip<00:04:53.009> continue<00:04:54.009> to<00:04:54.130> remove<00:04:54.280> all<00:04:54.550> the

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
clean the tip continue to remove all the

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:06.600 
clean the tip continue to remove all the
solder<00:05:00.419> remove<00:05:01.419> with<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:02.280> solder<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.370> run

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
solder remove with that solder and run

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.510 
solder remove with that solder and run
your<00:05:06.729> bridge<00:05:06.940> again<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:11.710> remove<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.250> solder

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
your bridge again and remove the solder

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.820 
your bridge again and remove the solder
from<00:05:12.639> your<00:05:13.919> bagger<00:05:16.530> okay<00:05:17.530> if<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.680> have<00:05:17.800> a

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
from your bagger okay if you have a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.770 
from your bagger okay if you have a
magnifying<00:05:18.400> glass<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:19.060> helps<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.539> make<00:05:19.750> sure

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
magnifying glass it helps to make sure

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.800 
magnifying glass it helps to make sure
that<00:05:20.320> dumb<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.970> get<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.150> good<00:05:22.389> look<00:05:22.539> at<00:05:22.690> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
that dumb you get a good look at the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.580 
that dumb you get a good look at the
bridge<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.229> make<00:05:23.260> sure<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.800> there<00:05:24.100> are<00:05:24.160> no

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
bridge to make sure that there are no

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.110 
bridge to make sure that there are no
contacts<00:05:26.590> or<00:05:26.740> they're<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.340> disorders

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
contacts or they're the disorders

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.430 
contacts or they're the disorders
completely<00:05:28.660> separated<00:05:29.260> from<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:30.460> two<00:05:30.729> boards

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
completely separated from the two boards

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.800 
completely separated from the two boards
so<00:05:32.789> it<00:05:33.789> looks<00:05:33.970> like<00:05:34.030> we<00:05:34.270> got<00:05:34.479> it

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
so it looks like we got it

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.000 
so it looks like we got it
looks<00:05:35.530> like<00:05:35.770> that's<00:05:36.010> about<00:05:36.190> right<00:05:37.830> so<00:05:38.830> let's

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
looks like that's about right so let's

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.830 
looks like that's about right so let's
go<00:05:39.220> ahead<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:41.400> remove<00:05:42.400> our<00:05:42.729> board<00:05:43.030> we're

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
go ahead and remove our board we're

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.320 
go ahead and remove our board we're
going<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.110> just<00:05:44.259> basically<00:05:45.130> just<00:05:45.580> pry<00:05:45.880> up<00:05:46.090> here

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
going to just basically just pry up here

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:55.710 
going to just basically just pry up here
in<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.479> corner<00:05:49.979> it<00:05:50.979> comes<00:05:51.220> right<00:05:51.400> off

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720
