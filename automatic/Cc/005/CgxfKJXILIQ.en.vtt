throughout the week with Coach all right
even<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.380> ball's<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.709> coming<00:02:25.980> my<00:02:26.070> way<00:02:26.100> he<00:02:26.850> uh

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
even if ball's not coming my way he uh

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.610 
even if ball's not coming my way he uh
he's<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.450> grinding<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:27.959> us<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.260> expecting

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
he's really grinding on us and expecting

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.290 
he's really grinding on us and expecting
us<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:29.160> always<00:02:29.370> think<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> boss<00:02:29.880> coming<00:02:30.120> our

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
us to always think the boss coming our

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.970 
us to always think the boss coming our
way<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:31.110> they<00:02:31.200> lined<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> just

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
way so when they lined up there I just

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.370 
way so when they lined up there I just
thought<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.360> good<00:02:33.510> stance<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:34.200> back

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
thought that in the good stance go back

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.730 
thought that in the good stance go back
to<00:02:34.500> my<00:02:34.620> fundamentals<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.520> play<00:02:35.970> ball

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
to my fundamentals and just play ball

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.840 
to my fundamentals and just play ball
you<00:02:37.740> always<00:02:37.980> dream<00:02:38.160> by<00:02:38.310> making<00:02:38.610> those<00:02:38.700> types

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
you always dream by making those types

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.270 
you always dream by making those types
of<00:02:39.030> plays<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:40.200> sometimes<00:02:40.560> our

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
of plays and but sometimes our

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.350 
of plays and but sometimes our
quarterback<00:02:41.790> he<00:02:41.910> puts<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.300> right

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
quarterback he puts it in the right

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.850 
quarterback he puts it in the right
exact<00:02:42.720> spot<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.140> now<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.380> make<00:02:43.530> those<00:02:43.650> plays

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
exact spot and now we make those plays

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.470 
exact spot and now we make those plays
in<00:02:44.010> practice<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.120> try<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.270> gain

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
in practice so we just try to gain

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.670 
in practice so we just try to gain
confidence<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.930> practice<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.320> when<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.500> come

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
confidence and practice so when we come

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.010 
confidence and practice so when we come
out<00:02:46.709> here<00:02:46.830> we<00:02:47.070> make<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.340> look<00:02:47.400> easy<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:48.239> when<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
out here we make it look easy but when I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.600 
out here we make it look easy but when I
figured<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.800> didn't<00:02:50.040> count

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
figured out that it didn't count

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340 
figured out that it didn't count
I<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.060> went<00:02:51.209> back<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.600> know<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:51.930> dialed

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
I just went back you know we just dialed

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.050 
I just went back you know we just dialed
in<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.830> retraced<00:02:53.220> our<00:02:53.310> steps<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> knew<00:02:53.880> that

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
in we retraced our steps and I knew that

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.000 
in we retraced our steps and I knew that
we<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.510> initially<00:02:55.410> come<00:02:55.590> back<00:02:55.770> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
we have to initially come back and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.920 
we have to initially come back and
finish<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.430> play<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.910> that's<00:02:57.360> what<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.600> did<00:02:57.750> my

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
finish the play so that's what we did my

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.660 
finish the play so that's what we did my
just<00:02:58.110> like<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.620> said<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.040> listen<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.519> coach

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
just like I said just listen to coach

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.890 
just like I said just listen to coach
Stein<00:02:59.910> doesn't<00:03:00.090> matter<00:03:00.360> what<00:03:00.480> happened<00:03:00.810> we

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
Stein doesn't matter what happened we

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.739 
Stein doesn't matter what happened we
always<00:03:01.110> think<00:03:01.230> about<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> next<00:03:01.590> play
