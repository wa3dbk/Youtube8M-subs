can<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> find<00:01:07.290> out<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.770> not<00:01:08.270> well<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
can you find out more or not well that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
can you find out more or not well that
there<00:01:09.810> might<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> few<00:01:10.350> documents<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:11.010> or

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
there might be a few documents here or

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.469 
there might be a few documents here or
there<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.520> they<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.180> quite

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
there but actually they they were quite

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
there but actually they they were quite
common<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> time<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
common at the time and I think one of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
common at the time and I think one of
the<00:01:14.369> amazing<00:01:14.490> things<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> survived<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the amazing things that it survived this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
the amazing things that it survived this
long<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.890> probably<00:01:17.009> quite<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> common<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
long so it was probably quite a common a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.320 
long so it was probably quite a common a
common<00:01:18.570> instrument<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> 17<00:01:20.310> 1800<00:01:20.759> s<00:01:21.000> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
common instrument in in the 17 1800 s so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.960 
common instrument in in the 17 1800 s so

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
pressure is sort of the same but

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.589 
pressure is sort of the same but
actually<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:43.939> excited<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.480> the

concerts<00:05:19.889> I<00:05:20.010> think<00:05:20.220> when<00:05:20.340> they<00:05:20.490> see<00:05:20.550> how

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
concerts I think when they see how

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.689 
concerts I think when they see how
extraordinary<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.389> is<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:22.770> know<00:05:22.889> how<00:05:23.340> hard<00:05:23.550> a

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
extraordinary it is you know how hard a

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.550 
extraordinary it is you know how hard a
musician<00:05:24.060> works<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.630> beautiful<00:05:25.229> results

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
that they get and and I think there's a

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.839 
that they get and and I think there's a
lot<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.889> can<00:05:29.039> be<00:05:29.099> done<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.490> know<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.669> don't

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
lot that can be done you know you don't

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.430
