the<00:00:06.729> moon<00:00:06.939> is<00:00:07.120> not<00:00:07.330> a<00:00:07.390> planet<00:00:07.569> but<00:00:08.230> rather<00:00:08.410> a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:08.560 
the moon is not a planet but rather a

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.830 
the moon is not a planet but rather a
satellite<00:00:09.130> of<00:00:09.310> the<00:00:09.340> earth<00:00:09.460> this<00:00:10.300> means<00:00:10.360> that

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
satellite of the earth this means that

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.780 
satellite of the earth this means that
the<00:00:10.990> moon<00:00:11.200> orbits<00:00:11.710> around<00:00:11.830> the<00:00:12.070> earth<00:00:12.250> as<00:00:12.580> the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
the moon orbits around the earth as the

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.210 
the moon orbits around the earth as the
Earth<00:00:12.940> orbits<00:00:13.210> around<00:00:13.540> the<00:00:13.750> Sun<00:00:14.040> may<00:00:15.040> have

Earth orbits around the Sun may have

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.679 
Earth orbits around the Sun may have
noticed<00:00:15.610> that<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.880> moon<00:00:16.029> doesn't<00:00:16.299> look<00:00:16.570> the

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
noticed that the moon doesn't look the

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.960 
noticed that the moon doesn't look the
same<00:00:16.720> every<00:00:17.260> night<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:18.039> is<00:00:18.220> because<00:00:18.580> of<00:00:18.820> how

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
same every night this is because of how

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.880 
same every night this is because of how
the<00:00:19.029> Sun<00:00:19.359> is<00:00:19.390> illuminating<00:00:19.749> the<00:00:20.289> moon<00:00:20.499> in<00:00:20.740> its

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
the Sun is illuminating the moon in its

the Sun is illuminating the moon in its
different<00:00:21.099> stages<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.960> are<00:00:26.109> eight

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
different stages there are eight

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.140 
different stages there are eight
distinct<00:00:26.650> stages<00:00:26.949> of<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.400> news<00:00:27.609> we<00:00:27.999> will

distinct stages of the news we will

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.210 
distinct stages of the news we will
begin<00:00:28.300> with<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.810> new<00:00:29.019> moon<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:29.980> safe

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
begin with the new moon this safe

happens when the man is directly between

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.110 
happens when the man is directly between
the<00:00:32.020> Earth<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.560> Sun<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.160> moon<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.910> still

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
the Earth and the Sun the moon is still

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.000 
the Earth and the Sun the moon is still
being<00:00:34.300> illuminated<00:00:34.629> that<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.410> illuminated

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
being illuminated that the illuminated

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.860 
being illuminated that the illuminated
portion<00:00:36.039> of<00:00:36.489> space<00:00:36.699> away<00:00:37.000> from<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.329> earth<00:00:37.480> so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
portion of space away from the earth so

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.170 
portion of space away from the earth so
we<00:00:38.020> cannot<00:00:38.289> see<00:00:38.590> it<00:00:44.489> next<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:45.609> a<00:00:45.730> waxing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
we cannot see it next is a waxing

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.660 
we cannot see it next is a waxing
crescent<00:00:46.469> waxing<00:00:47.469> means<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.949> lit<00:00:48.129> portion<00:00:48.160> is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
crescent waxing means the lit portion is

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.419 
crescent waxing means the lit portion is
increasing<00:00:49.329> from<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.570> last<00:00:49.840> phase<00:00:50.429> Crescent

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
increasing from the last phase Crescent

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.400 
increasing from the last phase Crescent
means<00:00:51.699> that<00:00:51.910> less<00:00:52.120> than<00:00:52.149> half<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.989> moon<00:00:53.170> is

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
means that less than half of the moon is

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.400 
means that less than half of the moon is
visible<00:00:53.620> in<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:54.879> waxing<00:00:55.269> crescent<00:00:55.420> phase<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
visible in the waxing crescent phase the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.709 
visible in the waxing crescent phase the
moon<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.739> not<00:00:56.980> yet<00:00:57.309> half<00:00:57.609> illuminated<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.600> it

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
moon is not yet half illuminated so it

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.120 
moon is not yet half illuminated so it
looks<00:00:58.870> like<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.079> cut<00:00:59.350> cut<00:00:59.530> from<00:00:59.679> the<00:00:59.859> earth<00:01:05.130> now

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
looks like a cut cut from the earth now

looks like a cut cut from the earth now
comes<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.700> first<00:01:06.880> order<00:01:07.390> often<00:01:07.720> called<00:01:08.170> a

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
comes the first order often called a

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.440 
comes the first order often called a
half<00:01:08.439> moon<00:01:08.740> because<00:01:09.220> from<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.670> earth<00:01:09.850> the

half moon because from the earth the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.640 
half moon because from the earth the
moon<00:01:10.479> appears<00:01:10.930> halfway

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
moon appears halfway

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.370 
moon appears halfway
the<00:01:12.130> first<00:01:12.369> quarter<00:01:13.240> occurs<00:01:13.659> halfway<00:01:14.170> between

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
the first quarter occurs halfway between

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:23.460 
the first quarter occurs halfway between
a<00:01:14.590> new<00:01:14.920> moon<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.490> full<00:01:15.729> moon<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:22.470> waxing

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
a new moon and a full moon a waxing

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.100 
a new moon and a full moon a waxing
gibbous<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.220> next<00:01:24.549> phase<00:01:24.869> Jebus<00:01:25.869> means

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
gibbous is the next phase Jebus means

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.100 
gibbous is the next phase Jebus means
the<00:01:26.320> moon<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.710> more<00:01:26.860> than<00:01:27.070> half<00:01:27.280> illuminated

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the moon is more than half illuminated

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.660 
the moon is more than half illuminated
therefore<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.439> lit<00:01:29.649> portion<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.280> moon<00:01:30.460> is

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
therefore the lit portion of the moon is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.850 
therefore the lit portion of the moon is
still<00:01:30.909> increasing<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.960> we<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.439> see<00:01:32.649> more

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
still increasing and we can see more

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:41.340 
still increasing and we can see more
than<00:01:33.070> half<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.549> moon<00:01:33.729> from<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.000> earth<00:01:40.350> we

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
than half of the moon from the earth we

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.100 
than half of the moon from the earth we
are<00:01:41.500> not<00:01:41.710> halfway<00:01:41.979> through<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.520> moon<00:01:42.700> phases

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
are not halfway through the moon phases

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.539 
are not halfway through the moon phases
we<00:01:44.110> will<00:01:44.259> now<00:01:44.409> look<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.070> full<00:01:45.310> moon

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
we will now look at the full moon

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.639 
we will now look at the full moon
this<00:01:46.090> phase<00:01:46.329> happens<00:01:46.570> when<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.079> earth<00:01:47.289> is

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
this phase happens when the earth is

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.920 
this phase happens when the earth is
between<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.100> moon<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.579> Sun<00:01:48.880> during<00:01:49.840> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
between the moon and the Sun during a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.170 
between the moon and the Sun during a
full<00:01:50.170> moon<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.680> moon<00:01:50.890> appears<00:01:51.250> fully<00:01:51.549> lit<00:01:51.969> by

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
full moon the moon appears fully lit by

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.990 
full moon the moon appears fully lit by
the<00:01:52.210> Sun

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.600 

next<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.149> will<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> wanting<00:02:01.140> Givet

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
next we will look at a wanting Givet

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.039 
next we will look at a wanting Givet
warning<00:02:02.610> means<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> lip<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.630> ssin<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
warning means as a lip or ssin of the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.920 
warning means as a lip or ssin of the
moon<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.470> decreasing<00:02:05.119> therefore<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.570> womman

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
moon is decreasing therefore a womman

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.589 
moon is decreasing therefore a womman
giveth<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.770> than<00:02:07.950> half<00:02:08.220> lit<00:02:08.550> news<00:02:08.849> where

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
giveth is more than half lit news where

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:18.350 
giveth is more than half lit news where
the<00:02:09.720> lid<00:02:09.929> portion<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.470> lessening<00:02:16.880> we<00:02:17.880> then<00:02:18.090> see

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the lid portion is lessening we then see

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.050 
the lid portion is lessening we then see
the<00:02:18.540> third<00:02:18.780> quarter<00:02:19.260> often<00:02:19.980> called<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.760> half

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the third quarter often called a half

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.509 
the third quarter often called a half
moon<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.110> first<00:02:22.349> quarter<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
moon just like the first quarter the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.370 
moon just like the first quarter the
only<00:02:23.819> difference<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.660> from<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.170> earth

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
only difference is that from the earth

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.140 
only difference is that from the earth
the<00:02:25.890> other<00:02:25.920> part<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.640> moon<00:02:26.850> appears

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the other part of the moon appears

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.820 
the other part of the moon appears
illuminated
