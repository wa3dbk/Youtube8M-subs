00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 so far, welcome to one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.490
 new video should be the whole thing 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.259
 a normal round with the cs5 the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 new sniper rifle from dragon steve 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.620
 but somehow it will be me then 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 noticed that the part just 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 really only and ate kept arable 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.740
 I decided to do that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 play several rounds and get that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 So a little bit together too 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 to cut 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 I wish you a lot of fun until yes 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.769
 same in video chat maca in one 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.890
 situation where it is about death and living around 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.110
 I give him one live and die 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.790
 hit marca that gives us this sniper 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 Rifle is simply connected with bad luck 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.280
 do you believe me people this sniper 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 granted is simply connected with bad luck 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.010
 if an enemy somehow it is already 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.200
 noticed more often if he just 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.879
 By the way, it's ok to go somewhere 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.780
 on the distance as I said my mouse 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 perfect or normal 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.360
 Opponents stand in one place then there 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 Make a one shot if you are 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.590
 However, if you are in a situation 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 is where you have to meet now 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.990
 she just does not survive 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.840
 note this is just bad luck 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.909
 fax number rifle boskoop numbers like 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.880
 hit market 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.470
 weeks foot that is justified 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.750
 that was somehow in the bottom leg or 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.960
 the foot that was okay that survived 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:49.170
 but a torso hit marca let that go 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.820
 god, holy shit there but now 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.590
 that was the way it was when we just went out 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.240
 reload the scene after god 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.619

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.739

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.819
 crash help counts as kay help eg hello 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.260
 Granny died in the vital 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.980
 if we play with fun 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.520
 to suspect this hatch has now 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.300
 a hit marker or where 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.330
 where was he running the race hello yet 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:34.970
 not in a fought over whether that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.150
 Camp knows he recognizes level 2 with marca 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.670
 last 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 even at least a second in 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.340
 my dad, how many hackers wants this 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.550
 thing still in close combat against that I have 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.100
 but what he tube because high 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.730
 I have a car going on, what are you doing? 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.060
 The what was there was not blood right there 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.410
 Blood was a hit brand again 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.050
 think is just the hit marca king 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.860
 Tool that is just the hit maker 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.860
 king guaranteed 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:21.800
 nothing, you do not fight by experts 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:29.130
 quickly back behind me 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.590
 I've been waiting I Makarapa that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.800
 God that I was no other weapon 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.800
 already you are a marca worthy of him 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.780
 is down is already there what he has 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 but no more life 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.239
 Did you see that before ? 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.350
 no life and she gives it anyway 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.350
 hat maker what is that 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.090
 Exaggerated funny weapon honest 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.440
 oh my god that was really close now 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.040

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.840
 oh my god the thing just immense 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.710
 because this weapon makes no secret to you 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.490
 just lives assist and it is like that 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.200
 bad 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.030

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.580

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.540
 the best second is already muffled 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:27.610
 and running his wait wait wait 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:30.970
 now fact that was in short supply and with annina 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.750
