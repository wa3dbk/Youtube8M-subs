00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.290 

it's<00:00:41.350> very<00:00:41.890> similar<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.820> question<00:00:43.120> mark

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
it's very similar to a question mark

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's very similar to a question mark
that<00:00:43.960> would<00:00:44.500> be<00:00:44.680> one<00:00:45.400> good<00:00:46.120> way<00:00:46.360> to<00:00:46.390> run<00:00:46.810> to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
that would be one good way to run to

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:55.520 
that would be one good way to run to
that<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.800> when<00:00:48.520> you're<00:00:48.640> drawing<00:00:48.910> an<00:00:49.120> ear

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.870 

and<00:00:56.040> obviously<00:00:56.190> everybody's<00:00:56.700> different

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
and obviously everybody's different

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.620 
and obviously everybody's different
types<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.480> years<00:00:58.700> what<00:00:59.700> would<00:00:59.850> help<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> if

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
types of years what would help you is if

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.729 
types of years what would help you is if
you<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.110> thought<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you kind of thought of it like a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:15.980 
you kind of thought of it like a
question<00:01:01.980> mark

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 

because<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.830> helps<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.610> doing

this in a marker another thing about the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
this in a marker another thing about the
year<00:01:22.400> if<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.580> question<00:01:23.909> mark<00:01:24.090> doesn't<00:01:24.570> help

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
year if the question mark doesn't help

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.520 
year if the question mark doesn't help
you<00:01:24.930> well<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.950> should<00:01:26.130> help<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
question mark with a why shoved into it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.770 
question mark with a why shoved into it
and<00:01:32.700> learned<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.950> from<00:01:35.119> studio<00:01:36.119> 2nd<00:01:36.540> Street

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and learned this from studio 2nd Street

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.450 
and learned this from studio 2nd Street
an<00:01:37.020> awesome<00:01:37.590> awesome<00:01:37.710> schools<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.280> that's

an awesome awesome schools with that's
where<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:38.640> learned<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.119> I've<00:01:39.390> heard<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
where I learned it from I've heard it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
where I learned it from I've heard it
from<00:01:39.630> different<00:01:39.840> books<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.850> like

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
from different books but it's like

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100 
from different books but it's like
you'll<00:01:42.300> have<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.630> Y<00:01:43.100> crammed<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.899> ear

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you'll have the Y crammed into the ear

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
you'll have the Y crammed into the ear
and<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.800> this<00:01:47.070> small<00:01:47.430> form<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and that would be this small form you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:59.069 
and that would be this small form you
know<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:50.360> try<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> remember<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.200> Y<00:01:52.800> form

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:08.699 

inside<00:02:02.670> remember<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.789> Y<00:02:03.969> form<00:02:07.649> inside<00:02:08.649> a

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
inside remember the Y form inside a

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.020 
inside remember the Y form inside a
question<00:02:09.550> mark<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.950> know<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:12.819> has

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
question mark you know that that has

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.199 
question mark you know that that has
always<00:02:13.239> helped<00:02:13.540> me<00:02:14.640> obviously<00:02:15.640> there<00:02:16.150> are

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
always helped me obviously there are

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.880 
always helped me obviously there are
different<00:02:16.269> parts<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.959> but<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.739> would<00:02:17.860> be

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
different parts of it but that would be

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.009 
different parts of it but that would be
the<00:02:17.980> easiest<00:02:18.220> way<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.400> remember<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.879> at<00:02:19.840> least

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
the easiest way to remember it at least

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.630 
the easiest way to remember it at least
from<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.440> side<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.470> from<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.489> can

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
from the side and from there you can

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.530 
from the side and from there you can
kind<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:27.010> know<00:02:27.060> depends<00:02:28.060> how<00:02:28.480> you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
kind of just you know depends how you

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.059 
kind of just you know depends how you
want<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.769> know<00:02:29.890> you're

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
want to do it you know you're

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.070 
want to do it you know you're
simplifying<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:31.180> way<00:02:31.329> or<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.599> other

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.840 

you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.770> can<00:02:38.890> make<00:02:38.980> different<00:02:39.190> kinds<00:02:39.760> of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
you know you can make different kinds of

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.910 
you know you can make different kinds of
ears<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.020> just<00:02:44.080> stretch<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
ears you can really just stretch the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.560 
ears you can really just stretch the
cartilage<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.550> one<00:02:45.730> area<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:49.330> one<00:02:49.450> obviously

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
cartilage on one area that one obviously

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.590 
cartilage on one area that one obviously
doesn't<00:02:50.020> fit<00:02:50.200> into<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.470> Y<00:02:50.890> pattern<00:02:51.520> but<00:02:52.000> it's

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
doesn't fit into a Y pattern but it's

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.890 
doesn't fit into a Y pattern but it's
still<00:02:52.810> going<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:52.990> episode<00:02:53.470> as<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> fit<00:02:53.860> into<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
still going to episode as a fit into a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.880 
still going to episode as a fit into a
question<00:02:55.900> mark<00:02:56.020> pattern<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.560> still<00:02:56.710> going<00:02:56.800> to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
question mark pattern but still going to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:06.320 
question mark pattern but still going to
have<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.100> Y<00:02:57.370> jammed<00:02:57.880> into<00:02:58.120> it
