00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
I think I did the right thing I think

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.190 
I think I did the right thing I think
you<00:03:30.590> did<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.860> right<00:03:30.890> thing<00:03:31.070> -<00:03:31.930> because<00:03:32.930> you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
you did the right thing - because you

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.780 
you did the right thing - because you
wouldn't<00:03:33.440> want<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.650> go<00:03:33.740> against<00:03:34.190> her<00:03:34.400> because

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
wouldn't want to go against her because

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.559 
wouldn't want to go against her because
they<00:03:35.300> are<00:03:35.450> boyfriend<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.990> girlfriend

but you can skies can still be friends I
mean<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:41.939> think<00:03:42.939> that<00:03:43.209> was<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.420> right<00:03:43.540> thing<00:03:43.569> to
