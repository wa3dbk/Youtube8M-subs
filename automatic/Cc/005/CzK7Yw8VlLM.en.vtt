00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello how about youtube friends like this 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.440
 Yours missing 90 with a new 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 videogame this time we bring as 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.599
 you can see a boxer with a cover of the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 brand that is called is the model 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.859
 jacket as you can see is for iphone 5 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 It is white as you can see 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.650
 and well rather that this focus is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.750
 we're going to give a little bit about 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.340
 This case is based on what it does or what 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.280
 that manages to put we're going to start 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 open it to be so long this video is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.880
 increase what is the sound of your 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.130
 speakers this by means of a small 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.649
 sounding board I think you have this 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.590
 cover on the back which good 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.730
 conducts what that sound the speakers 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 put the ducts in the cover of what 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.969
 which one presumes to give more volume 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.340
 up to twice the volume of play 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 you're not going to check perfectly here in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.940
 this boxing that we are going to do as 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.610
 can see I'll put the box has not 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.110
 absolutely nothing only the cover 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.730
 no protector is included 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 screen serves absolutely nothing 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.250
 only what is the cover and is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.300
 completely in plastic we are going to put 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 all this one side the truth is very 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.170
 well packed and we will put everything is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 one side and now let's proceed to the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.420
 installation of the cover that gets 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.909
 this form is very simple 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 As you can see it is a small click and now 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.000
 it is placed what our foundation to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.130
 first view of the case is something 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.619
 thin on the front side 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.960
 but this back side as you can see 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.520
 if you increase some volume though 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.720
 be in this round shape for good 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.360
 make it easy to not enter it in 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.789
 our pockets the button cuts 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.369
 very broad as you can appreciate 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.920
 laterals on top and cuts what 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.049
 respect in our lighting connector 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.060
 our microphone and our jack 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.550
 hearing aids completely open and in what 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.100
 Regarding the speaker as you can see 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.289
 comes completely sealed and brings this 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.479
 small duct that good comes out of sac 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.369
 here on this part what is the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.590
 audio we are going to verify those moments 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.230
 with music obviously that this is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.360
 true not that if this one works 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.950
 you are going to be listening to such and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.319
 how to use the sound of the case so that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.480
 they can check and let good good 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.580
 try removing what is the case for 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.920
 that you can check it out as you can 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.590
 see the volume that you get to appreciate is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.590
 to the maximum and we are going to put some song 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.700
 as you can see they heard without having the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.040
 funda put now is a moment we are going to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.800
 put what is our foundation our 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.900
 jacket and let's see the song come back 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.000
 let's check to see if really 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.000
 this works we are going to put play 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.700
 Well the truth is that it is sincere if 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.020
 he listens a lot very much the difference and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.520
 good and we will try in this case with 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.970
 another gender so that you can 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.830
 check also this if this listens 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.280
 very good others that we are going to try 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.470
 some other 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.470
 what can we put s 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.620
 Well the truth is heard much 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.750
 power and achieve its function 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.370
 completely this case on the wall 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.470
 we were a very fair cut for what it is 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.720
 in the camera we are going to verify that this 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.930
 does not interfere when taking a 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.380
 photography using our flash skull 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.720
 I do not think it's any problem what 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.160
 let's try here in front of you and 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.739
 not effectively gives us no 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.300
 problem of taking a picture with flash 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.250
