that we use blend into the outer corner
of<00:01:49.320> your<00:01:49.470> eyes<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.090> suggest<00:01:51.090> using<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.540> color

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
of your eyes I suggest using a color

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.230 
of your eyes I suggest using a color
that<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.290> different<00:01:52.830> texture<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that is in different texture just so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
that is in different texture just so
that<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.630> create<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.259> different<00:01:55.770> dimension

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that we can create a different dimension

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.940 
that we can create a different dimension
to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> eyes<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.050> chose<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.710> matte<00:01:58.920> color

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
to the eyes and I chose a matte color

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.420 
to the eyes and I chose a matte color
and<00:02:01.950> we're<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.759> say<00:02:03.060> no<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.740> trick<00:02:05.160> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and we're gonna say no the trick to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540 
and we're gonna say no the trick to
applying<00:02:06.300> another<00:02:06.899> texture<00:02:07.410> on<00:02:07.619> top<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
applying another texture on top of the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.720 
applying another texture on top of the
shimmery<00:02:08.940> eyeshadow<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.619> give<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
shimmery eyeshadow is to give the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.320 
shimmery eyeshadow is to give the
illusion<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.360> deep<00:02:12.870> set<00:02:13.170> eyes<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.970> make

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
