00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello today I want to talk to you about Pisa 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.670
 that I owe to eliminate the sense of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.849
 swelling or avoiding the appearance is a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.849
 disorder of which we suffer a little all 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.699
 women also men 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 in short, I want to talk to you about those 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.730
 which are my natural remedies 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.199
 then first of all every morning but 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.840
 all of them 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.099
 instead of the other coffee I when 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.099
 I have breakfast 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.140
 I always owe myself the cup of green tea 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 then I take the liver back to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
 supermarket then the brand name 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 which I find practically I am going to warm up 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.700
 in water attack and when the water is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.789
 hot 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.309
 I'm going to infuse for 35 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.050
 minutes but packet like these 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 and then go berlin st there the non 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.879
 overcome because it is known that it is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.000
 sugar is not really good 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.129
 and then I have to say that I don't mind 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 absolutely therefore we must gladly 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 so now I want to explain myself 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.080
 because I have this green tea then 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.780
 you should know that green tea helps 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.000
 accelerate the metabolism to burn i 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 fat and cleanse our body 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.009
 from toxins to detoxify and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.369
 to purify ourselves is therefore a natural product 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.400
 really great so see it for the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.390
 then glass cloth when I am a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 home 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.770
 among other things, I also owe another cup 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.899
 of tea 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.539
 in late morning or early morning 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.990
 afternoon in short while if I'm in 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.939
 around often I happen to prepare one 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.759
 cup of green tea pouring melina 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.890
 little bottle and then wherever I go every 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.350
 so much snow consumed during the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.569
 day that is always good so it goes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.679
 well this cold and hot this tea 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:54.259
 magic green let's say other herbal tea 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.689
 that I sometimes drink when 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.890
 I feel a little swollen especially afterwards 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.929
 I had dinner this or after lunch and it's a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.149
 based fennel seeds 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.179
 fennel you have to know that they fight 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.819
 the intestinal fermentations that are 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.769
 precisely the cause then of our sense of 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.170
 swelling that continues to disturb us 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.180
 and therefore it is a very useful herbal tea 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.540
 I find it at the supermarket or in 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.860
 herbal medicine and really effective a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.709
 latisana completed I sometimes use 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.290
 in short, however, heaven at home is the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.090
 pisana in the angelica brand e 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.280
 latisana line which is located on 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.690
 supermarket always in the tea department 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.569
 of the herbal teas that is based on rose c 10 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.710
 love and fennel then draining herbs 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.880
 anyway 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.400
 we inform and I must say that the taste of 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.530
 all these trevisans and it really is 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.350
 good there is I like it to me in short 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.570
 therefore personally like considering 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.570
 that sugar is not good and that the 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.870
 taste is good I found some products 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.840
 really really good then these 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.980
 are the remedies that I use one thing 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.110
 However, it is important to combine the activity 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.240
 physics and healthy eating e 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.120
 about these teas because if 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.580
 we eat badly and never move e 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.500
 we see these designs definitely not 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.960
 they will work wonders then trying to 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.120
 move as much as possible to eat 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.200
 well in short to say about a liter and a half 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.390
 of non-carbonated water per day in the arch 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.050
 of the day so don't get down to 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.090
 lunch and dinner as many unfortunately are 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.640
 in short, forced to do matters 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.550
 working but it is very important for 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.110
 throughout the day 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 then these are the Pisans who 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.640
 I also use it from the point of 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.310
 view of the diet I try to stay 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.730
 careful certain things then especially from 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.610
 when I'm a naturopath and then in 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.770
 course of study that I have followed 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.510
 learned many things and even little ones 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.049
 tricks that sometimes 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.840
 we do not take into consideration and that 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.709
 instead they would do us a lot of good if 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.250
 they would make us feel good without trying 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.430
 so here too these are the short ones 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.260
 natural remedies regarding herbal teas o 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.300
 if you want to know also some others 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.310
 remedy that I use 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.139
 during the day also from the point 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.139
 view of the power supply 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.690
 let me know that in short, gladly 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.729
 I will make another video I send you a 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.419
