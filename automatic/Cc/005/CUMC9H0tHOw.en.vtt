00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
you know when you have our case on your

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.750 
you know when you have our case on your
phone<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> worry<00:02:02.370> about<00:02:02.460> dropping

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it won't damage the phone or the case so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.770 
it won't damage the phone or the case so
that's<00:02:05.820> perfect<00:02:05.970> with<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.330> lot<00:02:06.480> of<00:02:06.510> other<00:02:06.660> cases

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that's perfect with a lot of other cases

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359 
that's perfect with a lot of other cases
out<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.050> you'll<00:02:07.290> drop<00:02:07.470> them<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.220> case

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
out there you'll drop them and the case
