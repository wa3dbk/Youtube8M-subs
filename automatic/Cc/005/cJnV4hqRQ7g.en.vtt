Kevin<00:02:13.200> no<00:02:14.200> I'm<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.770> play<00:02:15.160> this

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
Kevin no I'm not going to play this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.300 
Kevin no I'm not going to play this
particular<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.810> particular<00:02:17.290> market<00:02:17.650> either

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
particular that particular market either

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.190 
particular that particular market either
either<00:02:18.550> team<00:02:18.849> could<00:02:19.030> win<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.510> think<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.780> draw

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
either team could win I think that draw

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620 
either team could win I think that draw
might<00:02:21.160> help<00:02:21.310> some<00:02:21.580> value<00:02:22.000> because<00:02:22.030> nobody

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
might help some value because nobody

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.300 
might help some value because nobody
really<00:02:22.660> cares<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.380> very<00:02:23.560> apathetic<00:02:23.860> game

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
really cares it's a very apathetic game

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.479 
really cares it's a very apathetic game
and<00:02:24.580> therefore<00:02:25.480> any<00:02:25.630> draw<00:02:26.170> line<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.680> over<00:02:26.920> 2

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and therefore any draw line it's over 2

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.460 
and therefore any draw line it's over 2
to<00:02:27.610> 1<00:02:27.790> value<00:02:28.270> might<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.630> some<00:02:28.870> value<00:02:29.349> but

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
to 1 value might have some value but

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.650 
to 1 value might have some value but
then<00:02:29.590> again<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.920> gambling<00:02:30.280> because<00:02:30.660> nobody

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
then again it's gambling because nobody

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.030 
then again it's gambling because nobody
really<00:02:31.690> cares<00:02:32.080> about<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> same<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
really cares about with the same the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.620 
really cares about with the same the
same<00:02:33.069> context<00:02:33.730> nobody<00:02:33.970> cares<00:02:34.180> about<00:02:34.269> winning

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
same context nobody cares about winning

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.509 
same context nobody cares about winning
a<00:02:34.840> friendly<00:02:35.230> there's<00:02:35.650> no<00:02:35.860> value<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.310> it

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
a friendly there's no value in it

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.370 
a friendly there's no value in it
there's<00:02:36.880> no<00:02:37.060> points<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.930> can<00:02:38.080> only<00:02:38.200> get

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
there's no points you can only get

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.470 
there's no points you can only get
players<00:02:38.650> hurt<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.130> you're<00:02:40.060> not<00:02:40.209> going<00:02:40.390> to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
players hurt and you're not going to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.509 
players hurt and you're not going to
hear<00:02:40.599> me<00:02:40.720> going<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:40.989> get<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> nice<00:02:41.410> cookie<00:02:42.340> for

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
hear me going to get a nice cookie for

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.100 
hear me going to get a nice cookie for
winning<00:02:42.760> maybe<00:02:42.970> there's<00:02:43.209> no<00:02:43.360> reward<00:02:43.720> for

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
winning maybe there's no reward for

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.350 
winning maybe there's no reward for
winning<00:02:44.200> Yeah<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:44.890> well<00:02:45.790> would<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.060> say

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
winning Yeah right well would you say

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.059 
winning Yeah right well would you say
then<00:02:46.630> they<00:02:46.810> better<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.290> bet<00:02:47.440> both<00:02:47.650> teams<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
then they better the bet both teams to

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.190 
then they better the bet both teams to
score<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> good<00:02:48.790> bet<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.269> consider<00:02:49.870> for<00:02:49.959> this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
score is a good bet to consider for this

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.559 
score is a good bet to consider for this
match<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.769> actually<00:02:51.549> would<00:02:52.060> that's<00:02:52.330> like<00:02:52.540> a

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
match I actually would that's like a

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.240 
match I actually would that's like a
50-50<00:02:53.290> thing<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.560> think<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.860> might<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.190> good

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
50-50 thing I think that might be a good

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.979 
50-50 thing I think that might be a good
idea<00:02:54.459> because<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.360> reality<00:02:55.870> of

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
idea because of the reality of

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.620 
idea because of the reality of
second-string<00:02:56.980> goalkeepers<00:02:57.640> or<00:02:57.880> second

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
second-string goalkeepers or second

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.300 
second-string goalkeepers or second
string<00:02:58.780> players<00:02:59.049> or<00:02:59.319> elected<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.950> circle

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
string players or elected a circle

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.640 
string players or elected a circle
temple<00:03:01.060> nobody<00:03:01.660> cares<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.110> they<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.349> scored

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
temple nobody cares if they get scored

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.050 
temple nobody cares if they get scored
on<00:03:02.769> in<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.010> game<00:03:03.220> therefore<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.700> would<00:03:03.849> be

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
on in this game therefore it would be

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.550 
on in this game therefore it would be
more<00:03:04.599> like<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.750> scrimmage<00:03:05.110> more<00:03:05.410> like<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
more like a scrimmage more like a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.410 
more like a scrimmage more like a
friendly<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.220> think<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.670> both<00:03:07.209> teams

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
friendly so I think that both teams

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.830 
friendly so I think that both teams
probably<00:03:07.900> would<00:03:08.760> should<00:03:09.760> get<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> goal<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.660> this

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
probably would should get a goal in this

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.710 
probably would should get a goal in this

know<00:04:13.959> who<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.290> gotta<00:04:14.440> remember<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.769> a

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
know who you gotta remember it's a

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.979 
know who you gotta remember it's a
friendly<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.459> think<00:04:15.760> just<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.389> minimal<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
friendly so I think just a minimal to a

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.920 
friendly so I think just a minimal to a
moderate-sized<00:04:17.709> bet<00:04:18.039> it's<00:04:19.030> not<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.479> game<00:04:19.750> she

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
moderate-sized bet it's not a game she

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.110 
moderate-sized bet it's not a game she
could<00:04:20.109> go<00:04:20.260> crazy<00:04:20.560> for<00:04:20.830> but<00:04:21.070> if<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.880> had<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.090> pick

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
could go crazy for but if I had to pick

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880 
could go crazy for but if I had to pick
one<00:04:22.270> thing<00:04:22.690> out<00:04:22.840> of<00:04:22.870> this<00:04:23.050> particular<00:04:23.260> game<00:04:23.680> it
