down<00:04:08.020> here<00:04:08.260> this<00:04:08.380> machine<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.040> fantastic

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
down here this machine is in fantastic

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:21.789 
down here this machine is in fantastic
shape<00:04:15.000> all<00:04:16.000> right

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.080 

hand-cranked<00:04:22.789> it's<00:04:23.449> hard<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.750> see

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.770 

the<00:04:28.090> back<00:04:28.270> side<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.810> machine<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:30.780> have

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
the back side of the machine I have

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.520 
the back side of the machine I have
about<00:04:32.790> only<00:04:33.790> 15<00:04:34.150> hours<00:04:34.330> into<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:34.810> one<00:04:37.380> as<00:04:38.380> you

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
about only 15 hours into this one as you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.940 
about only 15 hours into this one as you
can<00:04:38.560> see<00:04:38.680> 15<00:04:39.190> hours<00:04:40.230> yields<00:04:41.230> some<00:04:41.530> beautiful

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
can see 15 hours yields some beautiful

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
nuclear code right there where the light

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.540 
nuclear code right there where the light
fish<00:04:46.120> or<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.570> light<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:47.230> can't<00:04:47.980> get<00:04:48.250> rid<00:04:48.430> of
