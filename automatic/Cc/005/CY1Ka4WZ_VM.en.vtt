00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
I feel the guy was a little bit

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.620 
I feel the guy was a little bit
disingenuous<00:06:43.230> with<00:06:43.800> me<00:06:43.980> because<00:06:44.370> I<00:06:44.670> asked<00:06:45.540> him

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
disingenuous with me because I asked him

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.480 
disingenuous with me because I asked him
I<00:06:45.870> don't<00:06:46.050> know<00:06:46.140> a<00:06:46.170> lot<00:06:46.380> about<00:06:46.440> RVs<00:06:46.920> and<00:06:47.160> I<00:06:47.220> asked

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
I don't know a lot about RVs and I asked

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.100 
I don't know a lot about RVs and I asked
him<00:06:47.550> if<00:06:47.700> we<00:06:47.790> can<00:06:47.940> look<00:06:48.450> in<00:06:48.660> there<00:06:48.810> to<00:06:48.900> see<00:06:49.050> if

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
him if we can look in there to see if

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.410 
him if we can look in there to see if
there<00:06:49.260> was<00:06:49.320> any<00:06:49.470> soggy<00:06:49.770> spots<00:06:50.160> or<00:06:50.370> whatnot<00:06:50.550> he

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
there was any soggy spots or whatnot he

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.990 
there was any soggy spots or whatnot he
made<00:06:51.600> it<00:06:51.750> sound<00:06:52.050> like<00:06:52.230> it<00:06:52.650> was<00:06:53.430> hard<00:06:53.670> to<00:06:53.730> get<00:06:53.850> in

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
made it sound like it was hard to get in

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.880 
made it sound like it was hard to get in
there<00:06:54.180> but<00:06:54.240> all<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.080> had<00:06:55.200> to<00:06:55.290> do<00:06:55.410> was<00:06:55.440> I'd<00:06:55.710> do<00:06:55.860> a

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
there but all you had to do was I'd do a

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.670 
there but all you had to do was I'd do a
little<00:06:55.980> lever<00:06:56.910> lift<00:06:57.330> it<00:06:57.570> up<00:06:57.660> so<00:06:57.990> I<00:06:58.200> think<00:06:58.500> he

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
little lever lift it up so I think he

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.700 
little lever lift it up so I think he
was<00:06:58.800> definitely<00:06:59.610> hiding<00:06:59.850> it<00:07:00.120> from<00:07:00.270> me<00:07:00.360> but<00:07:00.710> I

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
was definitely hiding it from me but I

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.750 
was definitely hiding it from me but I
don't<00:07:01.890> think<00:07:02.100> that<00:07:02.190> would<00:07:02.370> have<00:07:02.460> changed<00:07:02.490> my

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
don't think that would have changed my

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.780 
don't think that would have changed my
decision<00:07:03.240> $5,000<00:07:04.140> motorhome<00:07:05.040> the<00:07:05.400> engines

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
decision $5,000 motorhome the engines

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.690 
decision $5,000 motorhome the engines
only<00:07:05.910> have<00:07:06.120> 42,000<00:07:06.930> miles<00:07:07.050> on<00:07:07.350> it<00:07:07.380> so<00:07:07.700> it's

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
only have 42,000 miles on it so it's

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.690 
only have 42,000 miles on it so it's
still<00:07:09.480> got<00:07:09.630> a<00:07:09.660> lot<00:07:09.840> of<00:07:09.900> infinite<00:07:10.700> transmission

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700
