00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
there that plasticky looking at Sarah

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.370 
there that plasticky looking at Sarah
leave<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.869> got<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> soft

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
leave that on there and it's got a soft

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.940 
leave that on there and it's got a soft
rubber<00:01:19.650> snorkel<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.290> feeds<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> feeds

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
rubber snorkel it just feeds the feeds

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.080 
rubber snorkel it just feeds the feeds
down<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.520> throat<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> carburetor<00:01:24.659> I

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
down the throat of the carburetor I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.350 
down the throat of the carburetor I
think<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> goes<00:01:27.360> through<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.030> choke

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
think it goes through the the choke

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.340 
think it goes through the the choke
butterfly<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:32.909> said<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
butterfly and they said it will when the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
butterfly and they said it will when the
chip<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.280> collapse<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.390> I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
chip is on it will collapse it because I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
chip is on it will collapse it because I
guess<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.780> twists<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.369> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
guess it twists it a bit but then it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.510 
guess it twists it a bit but then it
springs<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.590> position<00:01:41.040> again

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
springs right back in the position again

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.850 
springs right back in the position again
no<00:01:42.240> rubber<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.630> you've<00:01:46.290> completely

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
no rubber and you've completely

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.630 
no rubber and you've completely
redesigned<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> whole<00:01:47.640> thing<00:01:48.829> I<00:01:49.829> feel<00:01:50.430> bad

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
