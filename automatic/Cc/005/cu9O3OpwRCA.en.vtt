00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 but others do we were here now 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.990
 stand in the grip cut 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 recycling therefore the processing of plaster and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.010
 aerated concrete 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 we actually do on this scale as if 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.820
 few in the Netherlands 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 we are still innovating further 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 will still try higher 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 find applications for that product 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.519
 the powder that already goes after the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.930
 zip processing companies 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.760
 there you will be direct and use 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.619
 stone and concrete garden is often on the 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.750
 demolition location recycled to reusable 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.700
 building materials that can be significant 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.960
 cost savings are realized for 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.040
 clients 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.100
 we are and the time requested for one 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.809
 come up with a solution for a project 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.520
 on the a50 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.170
 there is actually my story in there 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.760
 started 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.559
 where you were asked did you 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 a solution for a very unstable 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.879
 you can party lame attitude sand 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.500
 something with that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.340
 that's what we made up for that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.230
 that would mix with cold and there 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.680
 We also have a separate machine for this 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.780
 building the table we have six weeks the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.880
 time and in six weeks also have the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.960
 installation built and to satisfaction 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 Some of the other 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.390
 special about this project is that it 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.640
 very nice for us as 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.420
 company to be allowed to work on the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.610
 construction of a new terminal on the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.620
 second mesh area 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.870
 we have a mixing plant here 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.110
 This is for the benefit of the 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.330
 construction of a new terminal and we 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.950
 mix here different products 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.560
 products with spent 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.420
 to strengthen the under job for 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 the roads and the location of the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.990
 containers 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.910
 the future of our company we see you 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.819
 pretty rosy because we are 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 always been busy with innovations 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.290
 now the application for for is more difficult 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.670
 project because there is less money available 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.890
 is a bit less but we certainly will 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.040
 also expect something again this year 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.019
 making enough 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.470
 fill innovations to a successful conclusion 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.470
 can bring 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.920
 hey
