00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
playing around with it once you have the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.910 
playing around with it once you have the
position<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.439> making<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.740> sound

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
position where you're making a sound

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.080 
position where you're making a sound
like<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.560> start<00:02:10.940> fluttering<00:02:11.940> your

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
like this you can start fluttering your

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.730 
like this you can start fluttering your
hand

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
hand

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.030 
hand
and<00:02:16.630> start<00:02:17.630> changing<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.560> type<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.770> call<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
and start changing the type of call that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.460 
and start changing the type of call that
you're<00:02:19.280> gonna<00:02:19.370> be<00:02:19.460> making<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.990> don't

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you're gonna be making I I don't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.290 
you're gonna be making I I don't
actually<00:02:21.650> know<00:02:21.950> what<00:02:22.130> type<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> bird<00:02:22.640> call

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
actually know what type of bird call

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.300 
actually know what type of bird call
that<00:02:23.480> I'm<00:02:23.570> doing<00:02:23.740> that's<00:02:24.740> why<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> call<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.160> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that I'm doing that's why I call it a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.880 
that I'm doing that's why I call it a
basic<00:02:25.580> bird<00:02:25.730> call<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:27.080> obviously<00:02:27.470> sounds<00:02:27.680> like

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
basic bird call it obviously sounds like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.180 
basic bird call it obviously sounds like
a<00:02:27.950> bird<00:02:28.130> but<00:02:28.970> depending<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.840> how<00:02:30.130> how<00:02:31.130> you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
a bird but depending on how how you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.850 
a bird but depending on how how you
flutter<00:02:31.550> in<00:02:31.820> what<00:02:32.480> picture<00:02:32.960> you're<00:02:33.410> actually

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
flutter in what picture you're actually

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.340 
flutter in what picture you're actually
blowing<00:02:34.010> up<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:35.540> could<00:02:35.660> be<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.780> loon<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.260> could

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
blowing up it could be a loon it could

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.740 
blowing up it could be a loon it could
be<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> dove<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:36.920> could<00:02:37.040> be<00:02:37.130> anything<00:02:37.340> right<00:02:37.750> but

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
be a dove it could be anything right but

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.940 
be a dove it could be anything right but
that's<00:02:38.990> why<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.290> need<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.500> play<00:02:39.680> around<00:02:39.800> with

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
that's why you need to play around with

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.520 
that's why you need to play around with
