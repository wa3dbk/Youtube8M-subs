00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 so people hello or it comes to one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.970
 new small lpm unpacks why small 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.420
 that I just remember 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.130
 I currently now we have a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 letter I was at the post office and I am 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.889
 like a little kid i can do that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.299
 I just did not get long 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.449
 it means I have to cancel now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 unpack because otherwise right on the wheel and 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.699
 yes I also have the end of the videos 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.350
 a little surprise is also there 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.240
 certainly a video title but that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.769
 I say right now still make it 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.060
 will not be so short again and I am 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
 not so unpack a letter though 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.130
 From how far as you can see there is here 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 my old desk I have a bit 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.809
 My dad had 99 with him on the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 pyre attic stand and 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.930
 Turkey is almost twice the size I have with 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.059
 a lot of space if you want to see 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 I still have my facebook page 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.239
 a picture of the uploaded and the it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.890
 really fat so it was then 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.390
 not so good but if you really think so 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.059
 tight is because my camera no means 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 only sensible not photographed then 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.760
 It looks really good and I like it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.079
 really very very really good 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 I have not even been able to place before 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.440
 eat and the keyboard has to be there 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.989
 Here I can only remote screen 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.609
 look any others fucking make 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 so we also call today from the nice 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.900
 julian regensburg and we again 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.140
 is bigger as well as the year for that too 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 device that is red the feature bsc and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.310
 is the host of the camera 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.670
 flank is here so perfect master 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 therefore one should have enough 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 also children in africa think that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.110
 have candidates 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 I know now is as a transition 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.600
 so hopefully it will be so wrong 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.920
 I do then most likely the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.100
 broken if he has the important in it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.110
 this is here you practitioner back envelope 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.329
 So you want programs I guess 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.340
 I think I'm okay , however 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.630
 I have to remember the other country 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.189
 Send that too is everything 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:58.049

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.049

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.799
 plastic by time made bloody hab 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.739

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.799
 longer and again read a movie 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.000
