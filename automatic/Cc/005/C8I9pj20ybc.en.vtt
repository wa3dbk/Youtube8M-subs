it<00:04:10.660> in<00:04:10.959> years<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.530> now<00:04:11.860> this<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.250> like<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
it in years and now this is like the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.280 
it in years and now this is like the
second<00:04:12.820> time<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.209> month<00:04:13.240> there's<00:04:14.020> another

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
second time in a month there's another

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.870

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
one with a self-portrait mirror so kind

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.599 
one with a self-portrait mirror so kind
of<00:04:16.000> kind<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.780> interesting<00:04:17.260> there<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.400> does

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
of kind of interesting there and it does

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.930 
of kind of interesting there and it does
capture<00:04:18.940> video<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:19.930> only<00:04:20.169> for<00:04:20.470> ATP<00:04:20.940> wvga

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.900 
capture video but only for ATP wvga
video<00:04:22.840> but<00:04:23.590> 5<00:04:23.770> megapixel<00:04:24.250> camera<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.610> the

video but 5 megapixel camera on the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.210 
video but 5 megapixel camera on the
front<00:04:25.090> or<00:04:25.600> on<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.840> back<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.740> front<00:04:27.010> there

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
front or on the back on the front there

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.940 
front or on the back on the front there
is<00:04:27.400> no<00:04:27.640> front-facing<00:04:27.940> camera<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.380> may<00:04:29.560> notice

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
is no front-facing camera you may notice

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.220 
is no front-facing camera you may notice
this<00:04:30.220> here<00:04:30.820> but<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.510> believe<00:04:31.690> that's<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.110> a

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
this here but I believe that's just a

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.710 
this here but I believe that's just a
proximity<00:04:32.680> sensor<00:04:32.919> so<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.060> not<00:04:34.150> actually<00:04:34.390> a

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
proximity sensor so it's not actually a

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.540 
proximity sensor so it's not actually a
camera<00:04:35.430> also<00:04:36.430> on<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.910> back<00:04:37.890> this<00:04:38.890> isn't<00:04:39.340> it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
camera also on the back this isn't it

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.930 
camera also on the back this isn't it
does<00:04:39.730> support<00:04:39.940> NFC<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.380> I'm<00:04:42.160> primarily<00:04:42.400> get

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
does support NFC so I'm primarily get

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.580 
does support NFC so I'm primarily get
the<00:04:43.060> battery<00:04:43.510> cover<00:04:43.690> off<00:04:43.990> while<00:04:44.560> it's

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
the battery cover off while it's

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.190 
the battery cover off while it's
charging<00:04:45.390> but<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:46.450> does<00:04:46.600> have<00:04:46.870> NFC

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
charging but it does have NFC

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.680 
charging but it does have NFC
capabilities<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.730> ships<00:04:49.030> with<00:04:49.150> a

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
capabilities and so it ships with a

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.290 
capabilities and so it ships with a
Google<00:04:50.350> Wallet<00:04:50.590> support<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:51.970> can<00:04:52.090> use

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
Google Wallet support so you can use

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.080 
Google Wallet support so you can use
that<00:04:52.510> for<00:04:53.220> mobile<00:04:54.220> payments<00:04:54.700> while<00:04:54.820> you're<00:04:55.000> on

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
that for mobile payments while you're on

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.550 
that for mobile payments while you're on
the<00:04:55.210> go<00:04:55.240> if<00:04:55.570> you're<00:04:55.690> at<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> retailer<00:04:56.440> that

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
the go if you're at a retailer that

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.860 
the go if you're at a retailer that
supports<00:04:57.220> google<00:04:57.400> wallets<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.060> NFC<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.720> will

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
supports google wallets and NFC you will

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.870 
supports google wallets and NFC you will
be<00:04:58.990> able<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.320> use<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.700> underneath<00:05:00.700> this

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
be able to use that underneath this

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.300 
be able to use that underneath this
battery<00:05:01.480> cover<00:05:01.690> here<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.200> have<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.350> 15<00:05:02.860> 20

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
battery cover here you have a 15 20

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.670 
battery cover here you have a 15 20
milliamp<00:05:03.790> hour<00:05:04.000> battery<00:05:04.260> which<00:05:05.260> should<00:05:05.470> give

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
milliamp hour battery which should give

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.200 
milliamp hour battery which should give
you<00:05:05.800> about<00:05:05.919> 7.3<00:05:06.850> hours<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.390> talk<00:05:07.690> time

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
you about 7.3 hours of talk time

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.040 
you about 7.3 hours of talk time
so<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.889> is<00:05:10.100> still<00:05:10.250> not<00:05:10.550> ready<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:10.940> go<00:05:11.120> we'll

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
so this is still not ready to go we'll

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.330 
so this is still not ready to go we'll
wait<00:05:12.169> a<00:05:12.259> couple<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.620> more<00:05:12.770> minutes<00:05:13.069> and<00:05:13.220> then
