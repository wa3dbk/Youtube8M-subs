00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 cedar came to the exhibition mvc 2015 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.799
 thanks to our friends by intel 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.799
 asus and chistyakovoy and comp 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.610
 on intel stand we found yolo scoreboard 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.090
 the most who collected the required amount 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.220
 with the help of crowdfunding frauds and 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.860
 this tablet costs only 250 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.529
 dollars to buy it if you sponsored 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.550
 it was possible to start 180c not mistaken but 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.989
 nevertheless what is he 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.030
 this is a fairly well- assembled 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.380
 such a machine with noble materials 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.720
 and practically 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.820
 the absence of any buttons if i 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.230
 I am not mistaken here are only two buttons one 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 of which a paired adjustment key 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.870
 volume 1 blocking lock and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.440
 they are located on the plastic faces 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.060
 left right side and plastic design 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 absolutely nothing like this 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.470
 of course plus because if we 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.820
 look at the same brand n 1 as I did yesterday 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.240
 she spoke very similarly to the ipad 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.280
 mini 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.250
 and why I took it now why I accelerated 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.070
 because last year we happened 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.720
 just the same week finnish table to a 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.030
 mans because one day 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.429
 Presented by nokia n 1 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.380
 and literally the next day guys from 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.600
 jolla is how we know finnish too 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.689
 The company presented its tablet to the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.270
 called jolla requires here it is us lps 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.880
 20 say about the characteristics they are here 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.649
 pretty commonplace here 32 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.359
 gigabytes of internal memory it can 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.579
 expand with memory cards it 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.369
 well here is a 5 megapixel main 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.139
 the camera is pretty good here 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.240
 efficient processor from intel well 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:51.429
 where else would this tablet would have stood no 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.590
 at standing z 37 35f and battery for 4 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.929
 thousand 400 milliamper hours which is very 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.899
 It seems to me a little but here are the displays here 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.770
 exactly the same as in the legs and in the ipad 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.490
 here is a 785 inch resolution display 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.140
 2048 at 1536 points looks great but 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.660
 I think that the most interesting lies 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.810
 it is inside because it is not 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.650
 android customize customized 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.420
 windows me windows and selfies only 20 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.340
 let's see what it is made of well 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.290
 first we have several screens all 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 here implemented through wipes 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.260
 if somewhere the noise does not scold much because 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.349
 which is also very recent use and took 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.090
 this tablet means the leftmost screen 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.890
 us but we have all our fingers on the very 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.099
 really but if you left weak it's 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.810
 such a hop where everything is collected 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.400
 what you need here you can enable 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.610
 turn off certain features here 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.230
 your missed posts are displayed 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.940
 outgoing mail tape from twitter but also 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.630
 I understand as you install additional 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.549
 applications 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.019
 the list will expand on top of us 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.850
 battery charge is shown and connected 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.890
 wireless modules on the main screen 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.840
 holes in it, I do not know how it appeared but darker 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.569
 the next screen shows you the list 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400
 all running applications you can in 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.959
 each of them go over in order to 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.560
 back to do just swipe 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.940
 right on the next screen we see the player 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.550
 As far as I understand 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.090
 This is for sure I donâ€™t know, but this is 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.550
 player 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.170
 why is he here separately and I donâ€™t 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.960
 I will say if you pull 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.100
 window below we get a list of all 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.590
 available applications 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.330
 Russian as you see there you can 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.640
 quietly install and after installation 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.650
 language change the tablet restarts 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.870
 It is worth saying that from the fact that at one o'clock 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.720
 You can judge the tablet works very 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.220
 fast it is of course good let's 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.470
 Let's see now how implemented 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.140
 contextual various menus to 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.790
 example if we get in touch and so 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.890
 looking for contacts, weâ€™ll pick one of 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.420
 contacts every time we want 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.610
 some action exists we just 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.650
 pull the window down and we like 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
 from the top drop down menu we can remove 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.700
 connect with someone publish 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.290
 edit contact and so on here 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.090
 this is the context menu is cool that 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.530
 you do not have somewhere so sweated some 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.080
 additional buttons to press to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.760
 get a popup window it's cool and 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.460
 like i said there is no here at all 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.020
 no buttons so all here is even these 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.060
 context menu they are implemented when 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.190
 gestures to help everyone 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.850
 the application you need to go back 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.710
 just do 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.120
 tooth and right ie if we go in 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.810
 some contact you want to return 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.660
 need to make a swap on the right 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.919
 the keyboard looks like this well 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.290
 let's just say not the most familiar 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.300
 I think our inhabitants need 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.430
 get used and understand whether you can like 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.710
 otherwise it is possible to do it in 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.290
 contacts let's see so found 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.120
 where to include other keyboards we 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.310
 go to the settings they are by the way very 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.870
 concise and let us start you 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.850
 show in the settings you have 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.190
 ability to adjust the brightness volume 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.290
 default call defined in the most 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.540
 important function on top as well as just 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.340
 Three points systems app and account 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.710
 we are now recording each of them and 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.030
 here the system has settings screen well everything 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.729
 it's enough 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.490
 ordinary for us and here is the item 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.690
 text input here tells what 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.630
 need to do when entering 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.210
 to change the language but we go heard 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.560
 add more and Russian and after that 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.560
 let's go back 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.440
 probably just do it and turn it on 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.740
 notes now add new note 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.500
 we have a keyboard and we 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.440
 we choose Russian as you can see usual 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.700
 and sucking keyboard 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.140
 fast enough and moreover there is even 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.360
 predictive flat that is you 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.590
 prompts you to enter but how 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.210
 and said let's go through all 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.310
 settings in the system you can 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.180
 customize everything from the display 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.950
 ending there any information about 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.680
 device language settings and 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.150
 can reset your device here 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.919
 there is a separate item about settings 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.570
 applications each application which 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.710
 implies at least some customization you 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.010
 can customize 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.410
 and of course the accounts with 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.000
 this one fell . we pull the menu 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.940
 add account can be 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.690
 Facebook from famous twitter of course 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.800
 google can add an account and 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.480
 if we connect to the internet there 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.340
 it will be possible to synchronize and I think everything 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.020
 your data was hard enough 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.200
 connect here to my internet such 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.330
 did this and even created an account 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.130
 Christmas trees and now we can see in 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.070
 App store probably and what 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.660
 many are interested on the main screen not in 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.400
 new applications are not the best 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.820
 no applications in applications at all 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.040
 I see nothing clear known from that 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.050
 what could be put but let's 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.780
 use the search lead them 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:52.680
 there 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:54.210
 but let's try this way but it seems to me 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.540
 what is today the application 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.190
 extremely little and find something from the usual 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.500
 what you use will be enough 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.300
 heavy up to the search results I found 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.080
 some just returned found some 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.850
 two applications but clearly not relevant for 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.740
 there may be some search 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.720
 I will turn so valley it is interesting that in games 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.400
 we also have icons so far 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.980
 loaded by name you can see that 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.410
 there is nothing known and familiar here 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.330
 i.e. these are some kind of arcades 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:24.510
 Well, which are just some of the same not 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.040
 developers wrote specifically for links 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.780
 in general, have to wait 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.000
 We are of course good that there is an icon 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.130
 this android is just loading here 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.800
 application store links downloads 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.260
 The app is compatible with android of course 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.050
 except good and quality 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:42.270
 enclosures and inexpensive by the way total 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.220
 iron and also interesting pretty 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.919
 operating system for it all 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.720
 you also need a decent ecosystem so 

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.040
 the success of this product will of course be 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.620
 depend on whether 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.870
 do developers at least want to 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.210
 hygiene as it was the case b was great 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.850
 quantity to purchase yolo products 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.400
 cedars came to the exhibition rbc 2015 

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:07.100
 thanks to our friends by intel 

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.100
 asus and scouring icons
