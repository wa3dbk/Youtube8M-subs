00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
pattern this will get this aligning this

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.999 
pattern this will get this aligning this
up<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.929> able<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.200> allow<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.859> get<00:01:16.950> a
