00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.570
 hi fighters 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 I want to talk to you about the most money 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.340
 class in hardline battlefield game 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.560
 and harakiri I noticed that the arc of players 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.250
 concerned about making money in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.350
 hardline 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.330
 and stops at nothing even 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.760
 a bunch of know-til servers appeared 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 where the guys play no brought up just stupid 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 driving around the car strange people for the sake of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.349
 buy this game for stupid flagship 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.210
 Why engage in such garbage when there is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.250
 wonderful class that allows 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 legally zashibat as much as on 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 for one hijacking you wonâ€™t for example 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 two days played about seven hours 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.120
 pumped from 57 to 76 lvl 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
 earning almost one and a half Leman's true is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 coincided with days of double experience in the result 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.170
 impressive even with a dozen fighters 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.420
 killed by electricity and gassed and brought 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.579
 great help to the team during the second 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.010
 incorporating double experiences is easy for three 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.039
 round hackers earned 250,000 for 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 buying camouflage coupe and so hacker 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.330
 this player class is inherited 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 4 battles hardline since game 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.320
 completely about something else was revised 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 commander's arsenal is adapted to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 clash of bandits and police 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.340
 It turned out very well in my opinion 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 even more interesting than fours to play 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.720
 hacker is possible in all modes except 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.119
 competitive rescue and tracking 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.310
 because it would completely destroy them 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 regimes would lose all meaning very much 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.689
 good play hackers capture and on 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.670
 robberies playing hacker you will 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.140
 use only the left mouse button and 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.299
 optional shift key 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.009
 your field map is available 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.210
 combat that can be scaled with 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.490
 using the mouse wheel 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.500
 if you hold shift and click on any 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 map location with the mouse, you can see 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 enlarged image of this site 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.770
 which is useful when searching for enemy agents 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.049
 A competent hacker is invaluable. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 help the team especially when in another 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.380
 the team has the same hacker 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.119
 hacker's weapon is set 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 subroutines main task is 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.219
 detection of opponents and hide fighters 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 your team with a mini opponent card 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.000
 detection of opponents can be done 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.310
 in three clear ways first using 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 gps scanner detecting signals 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.330
 mobile phones have this enemy fighters 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.020
 analogue drones scouts from 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.750
 fours 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.530
 the second one hacked the camera using a backdoor 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.360
 observations 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 and she turns to discover 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.670
 running opponents 3 by running trace 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.370
 which scans the entire map completely 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.020
 displays about it all opponents scanner 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 DPS is useful when using 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.560
 battle for point all opponents in 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.450
 the radius of his action will be exactly 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.940
 highlighted in your team on the minimap 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.280
 action through the scanner can be suppressed with 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.050
 using dps blocking is sensible 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.670
 cultures of the world allowing you to hide your 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.710
 team with a mini card of the enemy 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.600
 backdoor allows you to capture control 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.860
 over gas surveillance cameras 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.080
 electrical systems 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.480
 transformers safes with weapons 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.640
 the cameras are all just automatic 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.160
 enemy detection a gas system 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.540
 allows you to poison gas opponents you 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.430
 even have the opportunity to kill him 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.410
 if not disappear while he his 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.570
 the queue can damage the gas mechanism 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.050
 systems disabling a small 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.970
 time 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.010
 if the enemy put on a gas mask then you do not 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.900
 cause him no damage however 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.640
 few victim fighters slot for him 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.650
 preferring other gadgets 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.890
 turn the gas off for a while 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.940
 idle doing recharge 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.070
 taking control of the electric 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.690
 transformer they are placed on the walls 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.330
 houses you get a formidable weapon 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.400
 suppression of enemy running through every 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.350
 gets an electric shock if the opponent 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.360
 received damage earlier may kill her 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.310
 charge transformers 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.470
 also incapacitated they need 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.570
 time to recharge if the game has 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.220
 another hacker then you will be permanent 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.030
 battle to capture these key 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.890
 devices 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.750
 if the device is captured you can 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.459
 before grab it using backdoor 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.220
 or just make it neutral 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.350
 taking advantage of the trojan beginning of the round 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.390
 it makes sense to capture surveillance cameras 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.340
 on the way of the enemy from the base 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.410
 then capture their dependencies on 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.900
 situations for example captured and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.970
 defended points after use 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.770
 any kind of program takes time 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.750
 to recharge it for reuse 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.030
 use can speed up this 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.220
 process reducing the delay for this 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.380
 intended subroutine overclocking it 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.750
 has the disadvantage of overheating your 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.580
 subroutines but it is not critical besides 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.560
 you need to use overclocking to 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.720
 perform tasks on its use 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.880
 have your arsenal tools for 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.620
 encouraging squads of your team you 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.660
 you can give a couple of mouse clicks 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.340
 enhance reputation which is very helpful 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.199
 for not 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.330
 because it allows 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.919
 Free perk on the fighters which 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.660
 are key points you can 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.580
 activate fast throw you what 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.449
 will reduce the respawn time on them 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.790
 other fighters 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.680
 which is very useful for the team there 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.090
 one more effective program 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.949
 difficult to use 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.500
 as required by your team 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.479
 fulfillment of your orders and this can 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.729
 achieve very rarely as most 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.070
 players running as they want without regard to 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.120
 command targets this subroutine are called 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.440
 important . 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.960
 and allows marking for destruction 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.330
 Opponent players who achieved status 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.580
 important goal can also be set by squad 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.500
 team to advance to the specified point 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.810
 if your order will be executed you 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.700
 get rewarded however like me 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.710
 said odekvatnye fighters meet 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.419
 Rarely for example not such come across with 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.120
 ratio of one to 7 rounds 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.950
 Here is a hacker arsenal each of 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.680
 subroutines which can be pumped from 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.360
 first level up to 5 in the course of pumping 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.580
 their speed increases and 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.650
 recharge began to play and faced 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.050
 with hacked opponents you 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.430
 see how awesome you are 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.680
 instantly perry grab your 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.750
 the device is blocking your routines 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.940
 however sure pumping will not take you 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.590
 a lot of time and you are very soon on the bill 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.479
 bring more help to the team and 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.740
 accordingly earn and more 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.110
 than simple infantry 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.180
 You can play hackers by logging in as 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.729
 hacker either take a hacker place in 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.620
 round time if it is free possible and 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.380
 leave the post hacker during the game became 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.280
 simple infantry fighter just like that 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.889
 easy and profitable 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.990
 play hackers thank you for watching 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.940
 if you learned something new and 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.200
 useful or just had a good time 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.150
 put huskies 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.389
 sharing with friends and subscribing to 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.389
 my channel 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.730
 I 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.779
 blow job
