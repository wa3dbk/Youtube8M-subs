00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.529
 in a big city to get from one 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.799
 District to another need to overcome 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.430
 very long distance if you go 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.600
 on foot 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.369
 will have to spend a lot of time therefore 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.070
 people came up with urban transport 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.349
 who quickly deliver from one point 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.269
 cities to another first buses 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:33.170
 appeared when cities became big 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:37.310
 then came up with trolley buses and trams 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.110
 for them laid a special road near 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.420
 each tram and trolley bus or 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.740
 the bus has its own route 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.740
 that is, the street they drive in 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.460
 places where they stay 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.980
 special tram signs installed 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.080
 need to move wires with 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.080
 electric shock and rails 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.280
 the trolleybus also needs wires with current 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.509
 buses can travel on any 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.189
 the street they do not need no wires no rails 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.189
 so there are more buses in the cities 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.820
 some countries have double decker 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.430
 buses in one such bus can 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.760
 fit as many passengers as in 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.730
 two regular buses to go up 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.090
 on the second floor of such a bus you need 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.050
 take advantage of a special staircase 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.050
 located inside the bus
