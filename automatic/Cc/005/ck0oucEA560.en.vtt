00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
prefer to buy it because they already

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.870 
prefer to buy it because they already
have<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.260> controllers<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.190> not<00:03:25.610> only<00:03:25.730> that

have the controllers and not only that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.500 
have the controllers and not only that
but<00:03:26.300> um<00:03:26.860> it's<00:03:27.860> based<00:03:28.130> on<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.550> engine<00:03:28.910> for

but um it's based on the engine for
world<00:03:29.870> tour<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:31.489> definitely<00:03:31.730> could<00:03:32.150> handle

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
world tour so it definitely could handle
