hacks has a side mounted joystick and
the<00:00:21.630> question<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.289> how<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.400> install<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the question was how can you install the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.830 
the question was how can you install the
joystick<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.320> center<00:00:26.000> in<00:00:27.000> addition<00:00:27.510> they

a flight simulator with a center mounted
joystick<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:33.300> did<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.040> well<00:00:35.040> by<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
joystick how did we do that well by the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
joystick how did we do that well by the
way<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> old<00:00:36.180> air<00:00:36.510> combat<00:00:37.020> training

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
way this is the old air combat training

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.119 
way this is the old air combat training
simulator<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.510> built<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.559> long<00:00:40.890> time

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129

there<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.329> something<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> consider<00:00:49.110> when

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
there is something to consider when

there is something to consider when
talking<00:00:49.890> about<00:00:50.160> flight<00:00:50.910> simulators<00:00:51.510> and

an airplane capable of acrobatic flight

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500 
an airplane capable of acrobatic flight
you<00:00:58.320> notice<00:00:58.800> quickly<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> pilot<00:00:59.969> has<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you notice quickly that the pilot has to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.900 
you notice quickly that the pilot has to
be<00:01:00.660> capable<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.289> some<00:01:01.590> acrobatics<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
be capable of some acrobatics just to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.500 
be capable of some acrobatics just to
climb<00:01:03.180> into<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> seat<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> didn't<00:01:06.330> want

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
climb into the seat but we didn't want

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
climb into the seat but we didn't want
our<00:01:06.720> flight<00:01:06.960> simulators<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.950> difficult<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
our flight simulators to be difficult to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
our flight simulators to be difficult to
get<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.830> definitely

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
get in and out of and we definitely

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
get in and out of and we definitely
didn't<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.820> anyone<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.330> trip<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> fall

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
didn't want anyone to trip and fall

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039 
didn't want anyone to trip and fall
that's<00:01:13.860> why<00:01:14.100> pax<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> side<00:01:15.450> mounted

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's why pax has a side mounted

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.850 
that's why pax has a side mounted
joystick<00:01:17.360> but<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> early<00:01:19.049> days<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.590> did

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
joystick but in the early days we did

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
joystick but in the early days we did
experiment<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> center<00:01:21.540> joystick<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
experiment but the center joystick and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.249 
experiment but the center joystick and
the<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the one you see here was actually on a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.330 
the one you see here was actually on a
hinged<00:01:26.189> lever<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.720> worked<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
hinged lever and it worked like this the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
hinged lever and it worked like this the
lever<00:01:29.640> would<00:01:29.880> hang<00:01:30.090> vertically<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
lever would hang vertically from the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
lever would hang vertically from the
instrument<00:01:31.619> panel<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> could<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
instrument panel so you could get in and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.020 
instrument panel so you could get in and
sit<00:01:33.299> down

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
sit down

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
sit down
when<00:01:36.030> finished<00:01:36.329> flying<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.650> pulled<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
when finished flying you pulled this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.390 
when finished flying you pulled this
cord<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> lowered<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> joystick<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.220> can

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
cord and lowered the joystick so you can

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.039 
cord and lowered the joystick so you can
get<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:41.759> easily<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:44.490> worked<00:01:44.759> ok<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
get out easily this worked ok but I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
get out easily this worked ok but I
don't<00:01:46.259> think<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.799> work<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> virtual

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
don't think it would work for a virtual

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.480 
don't think it would work for a virtual
aerobatic<00:01:48.540> team<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.590> hinge<00:01:49.950> has<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
aerobatic team because the hinge has a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
aerobatic team because the hinge has a
little<00:01:51.149> bit<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.420> play<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.009> not

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
little bit of play in it which is not

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.530 
little bit of play in it which is not
ideal<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:54.149> precise<00:01:54.689> maneuvering

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
ideal for precise maneuvering

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.200 
ideal for precise maneuvering
fortunately<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.770> easily<00:01:59.369> modify<00:01:59.640> packs

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
fortunately we can easily modify packs

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.880 
fortunately we can easily modify packs

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
we can extend the existing frame forward

notice<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.549> will<00:03:50.670> need<00:03:50.880> rudder<00:03:51.209> pedals<00:03:51.660> with

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
notice you will need rudder pedals with

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.490 
notice you will need rudder pedals with
a<00:03:51.900> wide<00:03:52.260> stance<00:03:52.859> like<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.239> Saitek<00:03:54.690> or<00:03:55.109> SciTech

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500

or<00:03:55.829> logitech<00:03:56.549> pedals<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.260> will<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.709> a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
or logitech pedals and it will be a

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.580 
or logitech pedals and it will be a
little<00:04:02.400> more<00:04:02.609> difficult<00:04:02.850> getting<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.810> out<00:04:04.260> of

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
little more difficult getting in out of

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:13.840 
little more difficult getting in out of
the<00:04:04.620> simulator<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:06.600> use<00:04:07.140> caution

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.930 

and<00:04:14.850> when<00:04:15.630> exiting<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.650> simulator<00:04:17.280> it's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
and when exiting the simulator it's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.830 
and when exiting the simulator it's
easiest<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.660> back<00:04:19.350> out<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:21.030> step<00:04:21.330> backwards

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
easiest to back out to step backwards

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.380 
easiest to back out to step backwards
out<00:04:22.170> of<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:25.640> if<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.790> want<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.060> get<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> better
