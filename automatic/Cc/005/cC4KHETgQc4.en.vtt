00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.749 

this<00:00:03.459> is<00:00:03.580> the<00:00:03.699> new<00:00:03.850> power<00:00:04.120> feed<00:00:04.450> we've<00:00:05.410> swapped

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this is the new power feed we've swapped

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.060 
this is the new power feed we've swapped
an<00:00:06.759> original<00:00:07.330> Bridgeport<00:00:07.870> very<00:00:08.139> speed<00:00:08.619> for

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
an original Bridgeport very speed for

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.320 
an original Bridgeport very speed for
one<00:00:09.369> of<00:00:09.459> the<00:00:09.549> new<00:00:09.730> ones

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
one of the new ones

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.629 
one of the new ones
because<00:00:10.809> the<00:00:10.930> very<00:00:11.080> speed<00:00:11.530> was<00:00:11.770> there<00:00:12.010> past

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
because the very speed was there past

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.950 
because the very speed was there past
its<00:00:12.820> best<00:00:13.289> so<00:00:14.789> to<00:00:15.789> change<00:00:16.059> from<00:00:16.449> one<00:00:16.540> with<00:00:16.930> a

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
its best so to change from one with a

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.830 
its best so to change from one with a
with<00:00:17.350> an<00:00:17.620> original<00:00:18.300> Bridgeport<00:00:19.300> very<00:00:19.480> speed

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
with an original Bridgeport very speed

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.290 
with an original Bridgeport very speed
on<00:00:20.020> you<00:00:20.260> gonna<00:00:20.560> have<00:00:20.890> an<00:00:21.130> adapter<00:00:21.700> shaft<00:00:22.000> now<00:00:22.270> I

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
on you gonna have an adapter shaft now I

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.910 
on you gonna have an adapter shaft now I
don't<00:00:22.600> ever<00:00:22.720> you<00:00:22.810> can<00:00:22.990> see<00:00:23.289> that<00:00:23.560> but<00:00:23.770> it's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
don't ever you can see that but it's

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.900 
don't ever you can see that but it's
it's<00:00:24.820> just<00:00:24.940> under<00:00:25.480> there<00:00:29.190> try<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:30.220> focus<00:00:30.520> in<00:00:30.880> a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
it's just under there try to focus in a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.450 
it's just under there try to focus in a
bit<00:00:31.119> better<00:00:31.379> well<00:00:32.379> it's<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.619> bit<00:00:32.770> dark<00:00:33.040> but

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
bit better well it's a bit dark but

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.819 
bit better well it's a bit dark but
that's<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.630> adapter<00:00:35.079> shaft<00:00:35.350> there<00:00:35.560> with<00:00:35.739> the

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
that's the adapter shaft there with the

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.880 
that's the adapter shaft there with the
two<00:00:36.010> drives<00:00:36.340> on<00:00:36.670> it<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.320> comes<00:00:38.590> in<00:00:38.770> the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
two drives on it so that comes in the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.920 
two drives on it so that comes in the
kit<00:00:38.920> when<00:00:39.340> you<00:00:39.460> buy<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.640> adapter<00:00:40.149> shaft<00:00:40.420> and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
kit when you buy the adapter shaft and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.790 
kit when you buy the adapter shaft and
that<00:00:40.989> takes<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.500> from<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.739> original

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
that takes it from the original

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.170 
that takes it from the original
Bridgeport<00:00:42.640> very<00:00:42.970> speed<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.820> I'll<00:00:45.970> just

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
Bridgeport very speed which I'll just

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.900 
Bridgeport very speed which I'll just
show<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.690> second<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.700> can<00:00:48.820> actually

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
show you the second see you can actually

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.180 
show you the second see you can actually
see<00:00:49.329> an<00:00:50.020> adapter<00:00:50.530> shaft<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.550> it's<00:00:51.730> it's<00:00:53.190> sort

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
see an adapter shaft and it's it's sort

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.120 
see an adapter shaft and it's it's sort
of<00:00:54.340> around<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.760> sort<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:55.090> area<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.630> know<00:00:56.130> and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
of around that sort of area you know and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.790 
of around that sort of area you know and
takes<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.520> power<00:00:57.760> feed<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:59.320> one<00:00:59.379> isn't

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
takes the power feed this one isn't

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.080 
takes the power feed this one isn't
quite<00:00:59.829> finished<00:01:00.250> yet<00:01:00.340> doesn't<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:00.850> any<00:01:00.969> of

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
quite finished yet doesn't have any of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.989 
quite finished yet doesn't have any of
the<00:01:01.149> drives<00:01:01.420> in<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:05.340> so<00:01:06.340> that's<00:01:06.520> what<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.819> need

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:06.999 
the drives in it so that's what you need

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.819 
the drives in it so that's what you need
to<00:01:07.030> upgrade<00:01:07.509> from<00:01:07.719> this<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.319> a<00:01:08.350> brand<00:01:08.649> new

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
to upgrade from this to a brand new

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.749 
to upgrade from this to a brand new
style<00:01:09.819> power<00:01:10.090> feed<00:01:11.219> so<00:01:12.219> we're<00:01:12.340> just<00:01:12.369> going<00:01:12.670> to

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
style power feed so we're just going to

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.149 
style power feed so we're just going to
take<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.749> apart<00:01:13.899> now<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.259> show<00:01:14.649> you<00:01:14.679> where

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
take this apart now and show you where

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.620 
take this apart now and show you where
all<00:01:15.459> you<00:01:15.729> need<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.939> do<00:01:16.029> a<00:01:16.060> bit<00:01:16.179> of<00:01:16.209> shimming

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
all you need to do a bit of shimming

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.809 
all you need to do a bit of shimming
which<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.469> where<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.770> vast<00:01:18.219> majority<00:01:18.369> of<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
which is where the vast majority of the

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:38.070 
which is where the vast majority of the
work<00:01:18.969> is<00:01:19.209> when<00:01:19.389> you<00:01:19.450> put<00:01:19.600> one

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.590 

okay<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:38.950> can<00:01:39.100> slip<00:01:39.370> carefully<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.060> seed

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
okay we can slip carefully that seed

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240 
okay we can slip carefully that seed
would<00:01:40.960> just<00:01:41.170> take<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:41.560> won<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.710> couple<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.190> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
would just take you won a couple of the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.810 
would just take you won a couple of the
shins<00:01:42.520> off<00:01:42.790> now<00:01:44.070> she<00:01:45.070> weren't<00:01:45.250> happy<00:01:45.610> with<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
shins off now she weren't happy with the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.910 
shins off now she weren't happy with the
position<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.810> we're<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:47.200> going<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.470> these

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
position so we're just going to these

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.730 
position so we're just going to these
are<00:01:48.040> all<00:01:48.100> in<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.250> pack<00:01:48.520> by<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.790> way<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.620> we

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
are all in the pack by the way and so we

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.050 
are all in the pack by the way and so we
just<00:01:50.920> take<00:01:51.130> one<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.340> those<00:01:51.430> out<00:01:51.730> I'm<00:01:51.850> going<00:01:52.030> to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
just take one of those out I'm going to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.600 
just take one of those out I'm going to
put<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.300> back<00:01:52.420> together<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.830> see<00:01:54.490> how<00:01:54.550> the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
put it back together and and see how the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.040 
put it back together and and see how the
land<00:01:54.880> lies<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.360> start

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.230 

you

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.280 

so<00:02:09.240> when<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.390> put<00:02:09.510> it<00:02:09.600> back<00:02:09.690> together<00:02:09.870> teaser

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
so when you put it back together teaser

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.950 
so when you put it back together teaser
if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.620> make<00:02:10.800> sure<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> little

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
if you make sure that the little

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.240 
if you make sure that the little
Woodruff<00:02:12.960> Keys<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.860> points<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
Woodruff Keys are all points to the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:37.000 
Woodruff Keys are all points to the
don't<00:02:14.430> fall<00:02:14.580> out

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.399 

this<00:02:37.909> machine's<00:02:38.269> got<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> safety<00:02:38.840> handle<00:02:39.319> as

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
this machine's got a safety handle as

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.770 
this machine's got a safety handle as
well<00:02:39.439> so<00:02:39.980> when<00:02:40.250> they<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.030> power<00:02:41.239> feed<00:02:41.480> kicks

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
well so when they the power feed kicks

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.380 
well so when they the power feed kicks
in<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.049> handle<00:02:42.319> just<00:02:42.500> spins<00:02:43.209> doesn't<00:02:44.209> hurt

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
in the handle just spins doesn't hurt

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.330 
in the handle just spins doesn't hurt
your<00:02:44.540> hand<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.959> happens<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.379> hit<00:02:45.500> it

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.970 

I<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> sound<00:02:56.830> that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
I can see that that so the sound that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.050 
I can see that that so the sound that
should<00:02:57.160> make<00:02:57.310> when<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.610> getting<00:02:57.760> nice<00:02:58.030> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
should make when it's getting nice and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.580 
should make when it's getting nice and
smooth<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.500> then<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.730> you've<00:03:00.910> got<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.239> right

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
smooth and then if you've got it right

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.110 
smooth and then if you've got it right
when<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.680> push<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.069> now<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.730> just<00:03:03.879> go<00:03:04.060> to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
when you push that now you just go to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.449 
when you push that now you just go to
turn<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.480> handle<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.739> clicks<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.310> and

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
turn the handle it just clicks in and

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.089 
turn the handle it just clicks in and
then<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.569> we<00:03:07.720> have<00:03:07.840> power<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.319> it<00:03:08.470> would<00:03:08.860> drive

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
then if we have power to it would drive

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.589 
then if we have power to it would drive
but<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:09.730> don't<00:03:09.940> at<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.120> moment<00:03:10.150> because<00:03:10.420> we're

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
but we don't at the moment because we're

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.289 
but we don't at the moment because we're
still<00:03:10.750> setting<00:03:11.080> up<00:03:11.730> okay<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:12.790> that's<00:03:13.090> how<00:03:13.239> you

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
still setting up okay so that's how you

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.430 
still setting up okay so that's how you
just<00:03:13.569> change<00:03:13.810> your<00:03:13.930> shins

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
just change your shins

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.230 
just change your shins
all<00:03:14.890> those<00:03:15.099> are<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.370> pack<00:03:15.549> as<00:03:15.760> well

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.760 

so<00:03:21.240> this<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> way<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.140> take<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.470> power<00:03:22.710> from

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
so this is a way to take the power from

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.900 
so this is a way to take the power from
on<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.790> Bridgeport<00:03:24.270> milling<00:03:24.300> machine<00:03:25.910> this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
on the Bridgeport milling machine this

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.700 
on the Bridgeport milling machine this
is<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> power<00:03:27.390> cabinet<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.680> a

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
is the power cabinet here this is a

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.110 
is the power cabinet here this is a
relatively<00:03:29.220> new<00:03:29.460> one<00:03:29.640> there's<00:03:29.880> several

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
relatively new one there's several

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.180 
relatively new one there's several
different<00:03:30.510> types<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.930> should<00:03:34.200> have<00:03:34.590> an<00:03:34.860> ash

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
different types you should have an ash

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.640 
different types you should have an ash
unit<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.700> sorts<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.480> will<00:03:36.630> mail<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.230> look<00:03:37.560> a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
unit of sorts the will mail it look a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.170 
unit of sorts the will mail it look a
bit<00:03:37.800> different<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.250> basically<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.730> black<00:03:38.940> box

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
bit different but basically a black box

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.820 
bit different but basically a black box
in<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.420> bottom<00:03:39.690> where<00:03:40.410> there's<00:03:40.560> getting

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
in the bottom where there's getting

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.970 
in the bottom where there's getting
written<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.570> won't<00:03:42.840> need<00:03:42.990> this

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
written on it so you won't need this

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.980 
written on it so you won't need this
perk<00:03:44.250> box<00:03:44.520> anymore<00:03:44.820> or<00:03:45.180> any<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.540> cable

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
perk box anymore or any of this cable

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.380 
perk box anymore or any of this cable
loom<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.980> can<00:03:47.160> see<00:03:47.400> going<00:03:47.760> out<00:03:48.000> here<00:03:49.100> so

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
loom that you can see going out here so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.210 
loom that you can see going out here so
remove<00:03:51.390> all<00:03:51.540> these<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:52.890> by<00:03:53.040> unscrewing

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
remove all these just by unscrewing

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.650 
remove all these just by unscrewing
there<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.820> they'll<00:03:53.910> come<00:03:54.090> off<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.480> unit

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
there and they'll come off of the unit

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.280 
there and they'll come off of the unit
just<00:03:55.050> like<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:56.540> then<00:03:57.540> once<00:03:57.780> all<00:03:57.960> that's<00:03:58.110> done

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
just like that then once all that's done

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.710 
just like that then once all that's done
you<00:03:58.560> take<00:03:58.770> this<00:03:58.920> out<00:03:59.130> you<00:04:00.060> trace<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.510> power

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
you take this out you trace the power

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.690 
you take this out you trace the power
through<00:04:01.170> which<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.500> these<00:04:01.680> see<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.310> red<00:04:02.520> and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
through which is these see this red and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.320 
through which is these see this red and
brown<00:04:02.910> here<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:05.400> comes<00:04:05.700> through<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.240> it's

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
brown here that comes through and it's

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.260 
brown here that comes through and it's
actually<00:04:06.630> coming<00:04:06.900> off<00:04:06.960> this<00:04:07.170> contact<00:04:07.680> here<00:04:08.270> so

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
actually coming off this contact here so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.310 
actually coming off this contact here so
that's<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.570> 110<00:04:10.170> volts<00:04:10.590> coming<00:04:10.860> off<00:04:10.980> there<00:04:12.320> so

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
that's a 110 volts coming off there so

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.720 
that's a 110 volts coming off there so
that's<00:04:13.500> your<00:04:13.650> contact<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.250> for<00:04:14.400> your<00:04:14.520> power

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
that's your contact it for your power

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.150 
that's your contact it for your power
feed<00:04:15.320> sometimes<00:04:16.320> it's<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.709> here<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.100> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
feed sometimes it's down here on the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.550 
feed sometimes it's down here on the
bottom<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:18.480> you'll<00:04:18.630> always<00:04:18.810> have<00:04:19.019> two<00:04:19.290> wires

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
bottom but you'll always have two wires

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.710 
bottom but you'll always have two wires
coming<00:04:19.890> off<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.489> go<00:04:20.640> into<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.390> asking

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
coming off it and go into the asking

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.030 
coming off it and go into the asking
units<00:04:22.019> that's<00:04:22.200> how<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:22.530> tell<00:04:22.680> which<00:04:22.830> ones

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
units that's how you can tell which ones

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.320 
units that's how you can tell which ones
which<00:04:23.600> okay<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.800> new<00:04:26.040> power<00:04:26.370> power<00:04:26.970> for

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
which okay so the new power power for

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.200 
which okay so the new power power for
the<00:04:27.510> new<00:04:27.660> power<00:04:27.930> feed<00:04:28.200> which<00:04:29.010> is<00:04:29.100> 110<00:04:29.700> volts<00:04:30.060> is

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
the new power feed which is 110 volts is

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.970 
the new power feed which is 110 volts is
going<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.450> come<00:04:30.690> from<00:04:30.870> those<00:04:31.110> two<00:04:31.470> cables

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
going to come from those two cables

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.030 
going to come from those two cables
there<00:04:32.220> that's<00:04:33.060> already<00:04:33.419> fused<00:04:33.840> on<00:04:34.169> this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
there that's already fused on this

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.180 
there that's already fused on this
system<00:04:35.280> here<00:04:36.800> okay<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.530> that's<00:04:40.710> where<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:41.040> take

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
system here okay so that's where to take

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:50.740 
system here okay so that's where to take
the<00:04:41.310> power<00:04:41.550> from<00:04:42.080> for<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.169> new<00:04:43.350> power<00:04:43.590> feed

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.510 

okay<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:51.810> I'm<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:52.020> showing<00:04:52.229> you<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.680> power

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
okay so I'm just showing you the power

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.360 
okay so I'm just showing you the power
feed<00:04:53.790> upgrade<00:04:54.410> now<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.530> still<00:04:55.710> operates<00:04:56.160> as

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
feed upgrade now it still operates as

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.029 
feed upgrade now it still operates as
normal<00:04:56.699> off<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.000> switch<00:04:57.270> here<00:04:57.540> so<00:04:58.039> that's

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
normal off this switch here so that's

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.230 
normal off this switch here so that's
how<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.220> turn<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.520> on<00:04:59.699> and<00:04:59.759> off<00:04:59.970> on<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
how to turn it on and off on the

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.180 
how to turn it on and off on the
Bridgeport<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:01.350> still<00:05:01.590> works<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.009> East

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
Bridgeport it still works on the East

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.770 
Bridgeport it still works on the East
are<00:05:02.780> just<00:05:03.780> put<00:05:03.960> them<00:05:04.050> up<00:05:04.139> press<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.919> back<00:05:05.130> on

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
are just put them up press that back on

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.629 
are just put them up press that back on
to<00:05:07.020> apply<00:05:07.259> power<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.889> again<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.310> works<00:05:08.460> at<00:05:08.610> a

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
to apply power to it again it works at a

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.270 
to apply power to it again it works at a
110<00:05:09.060> volt<00:05:09.539> supply<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.680> can<00:05:10.800> see<00:05:10.949> when

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
110 volt supply so you can see when

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.379 
110 volt supply so you can see when
you've<00:05:11.370> got<00:05:11.520> power<00:05:11.820> because<00:05:12.120> you've<00:05:12.270> got<00:05:12.360> a

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
you've got power because you've got a

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.870 
you've got power because you've got a
light<00:05:12.630> on<00:05:12.900> here<00:05:13.850> okay<00:05:14.850> so<00:05:15.060> you've<00:05:15.810> got<00:05:15.840> a

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
light on here okay so you've got a

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.159 
light on here okay so you've got a
variable<00:05:17.880> speed<00:05:17.970> here<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.660> wrap<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.080> over

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
variable speed here and wrap it over

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.790 
variable speed here and wrap it over
right<00:05:19.530> there<00:05:19.889> now<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:20.850> kit<00:05:21.270> comes<00:05:21.539> with<00:05:21.800> auto

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
right there now the kit comes with auto

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.950 
right there now the kit comes with auto
stops<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.240> can<00:05:24.389> see<00:05:24.570> one<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.750> them<00:05:24.930> here

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
stops so you can see one of them here

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.779 
stops so you can see one of them here
and<00:05:25.320> you<00:05:25.410> just<00:05:25.620> move<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:26.010> up<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.310> down<00:05:26.400> as

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
and you just move that up and down as

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.689 
and you just move that up and down as
and<00:05:27.570> whenever<00:05:28.289> you<00:05:28.530> need<00:05:28.680> it<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.919> know<00:05:29.039> and

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
and whenever you need it you know and

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.629 
and whenever you need it you know and
when<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:30.030> stop<00:05:30.949> hits<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:32.130> maker<00:05:32.340> switch

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
when that stop hits the maker switch

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.420 
when that stop hits the maker switch
here<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.510> shuts<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.990> feed<00:05:34.169> down<00:05:34.440> so

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
here it just shuts the feed down so

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.490 
here it just shuts the feed down so
that's<00:05:35.610> that's<00:05:35.910> what<00:05:36.120> they<00:05:36.210> look<00:05:36.389> like<00:05:36.500> before

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
that's that's what they look like before

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.340 
that's that's what they look like before
you<00:05:37.560> put<00:05:37.770> them<00:05:37.889> on<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:38.220> they<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.490> simply<00:05:39.350> and

okay<00:05:51.509> so<00:05:51.570> I'll<00:05:51.840> just<00:05:51.990> power<00:05:52.169> up<00:05:52.380> now

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.080

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
straight back to feed back to the middle

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.270 
straight back to feed back to the middle
let<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:15.000> stop<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:15.510> then<00:06:15.600> go<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.900> other<00:06:15.930> way

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
again you can vary the speed up down or

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.200 
again you can vary the speed up down or
wrap<00:06:24.510> it<00:06:24.630> over<00:06:24.690> I'll<00:06:28.760> turn<00:06:29.760> it<00:06:29.880> back<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.060> the

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
wrap it over I'll turn it back to the

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.150 
wrap it over I'll turn it back to the
middle<00:06:30.330> at<00:06:30.600> its<00:06:30.720> top<00:06:30.960> and<00:06:31.110> there's<00:06:31.860> also<00:06:32.010> a

middle at its top and there's also a

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.150 
middle at its top and there's also a
power<00:06:32.400> off<00:06:32.639> switch<00:06:32.910> here<00:06:33.710> so<00:06:34.710> the<00:06:34.800> indicator

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
power off switch here so the indicator

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.320 
power off switch here so the indicator
goes<00:06:35.370> off<00:06:35.580> um<00:06:36.169> back<00:06:37.169> on<00:06:37.290> again

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330
