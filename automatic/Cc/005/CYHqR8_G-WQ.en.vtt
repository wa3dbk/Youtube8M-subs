00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.589
 today for my very first video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.420
 actually on aws ocean effect which has 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 been developed by the magicka studio 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 if I have no nonsense and if you do not 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.969
 not know but effective it's a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.940
 wizarding game and I invite you to go 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.869
 on the internet to get more 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.880
 information about this game 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.920
 finally we do not advertise 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.840
 on magic so we're here to play 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.430
 this game then detects two types of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 parties that offers us rockets 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760
 of match and the good custom games 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.160
 worried customers of match that we 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.219
 allow to unblock 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 points we will say for our future that this 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.940
 that they have bet assured to our future 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.649
 at the character level purchases and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 weapons because yes there are several 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.120
 old people arms so that's it 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.910
 the shock of the game we will say so the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.430
 bundles whose which brother's cost days 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 characters etc 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.780
 and that's where it's the money of the game 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.370
 that's the shop you can buy 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 that with gambling money in all 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 unlockable weapons with skins that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.379
 it's the unlockable weapons and that's 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 skins unlockable weapons actually 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.780
 and that's all the accessories and more 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.310
 for the character plus the characters 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.170
 which are unlockable therefore in number of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.520
 six so characters that are 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.600
 free plus the four characters that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.820
 are here so in total six 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
 characters so we will lose more than 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 time we will say and do not think about 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 go on a batch quest best hockey of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 match so many we will say tip 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.369
 who gave us products of the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.990
 hunt behind it maybe will do 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.970
 maybe the price during the video I 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 do not know too much I'll see by doing the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.040
 montage for that several tips a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.500
 used code control to stay a guy 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.509
 cool in the same line finally ok I 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 no time to read so there so 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.750
 characters that are basic data 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.189
 whom the man and the woman 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.259
 my heart and who it is weapons 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.119
 main secondary weapons plus the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 special fate to the staff in fact so 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.110
 each character you compare has 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.180
 special dancers and goodies 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.219
 compromise on characters so from the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.380
 customization in addition so there I have him 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.820
 put a cap for example so we're going 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.500
 see how many people ok so the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 part of the boats get started in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.120
 fourteen seconds so so what is this 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.520
 that I can say more so the two 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.070
 old guy and a guy with a wick that 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.390
 exceed oil it should do it I 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.860
 notice that people finally that the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.360
 old or are always with us where 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.130
 it's possible we'll do it I'm late 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.680
 long my shot I hope it will work 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.700
 but know about gene and video so we 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.110
 will end up on a map that I 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.730
 do not know at all I do not know at all 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.630
 what is it at the same time so if I 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.830
 do not be stupid talking head 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.700
 of andre so it acts as sensors 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.750
 optics and oscar oscar in this calm 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.590
 shield so use that so that's it 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.380
 that's how special it was 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.700
 shields katana katana katana and the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.320
 day this cargo france 4 2 he 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.120
 frankly it was rather profitable 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.280
 we will treat rather profitable so of 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.740
 useful in chinese eyes in quebec with a 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.570
 drop that goes beyond that goes for that so 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.650
 fascists one can plant everywhere in 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.340
 flag with a dog's head 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.750
 now we will not touch a purse 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.580
 ok ok so the old it will calm down and 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.150
 already with his lightsaber coming out of 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.920
 at padua yes treat themselves announcement there 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.120
 it was he who killed me he was gone 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.200
 heal so the key b to get 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.660
 heal goodbye we see the little ones 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.010
 more glass that tell me when we are 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.380
 heals and not some notes red bar 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.540
 guess blue beard that allows precisely 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.160
 tell us when when the true say the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.390
 cool gives two special mentions of which 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.250
 the shield and hop 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.050
 so when they available so the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.459
 shield while we have that we can 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.140
 take the hand so there is not bad 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.630
 interaction with the decor so the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.760
 shield the mass that can be thrown by 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.450
 the suite with shift 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.180
 finally a touch that are calm 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.940
 ok so customizable synergy 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.660
 so glide attention attention attention 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.560
 which they want you to like you are 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.000
 young you are good you will not kill no no 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.150
 no the game which ok the game which are 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 behind me who's killing me so it's not 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.670
 serious 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.930
 so we can even take the crucifix on 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.730
 includes the crucifix in the hand one goes 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.550
 to type with these parties to type 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.320
 crucifix so 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.460
 I do not really know where there is not 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.510
 really fuselage that tells us where 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.110
 are the enemies finally not for 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.240
 the moment anyway 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.730
 tech after i will show you the arrow 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.590
 finally after three minutes what you 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.250
 3bis so there I will take again lens 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.140
 will not have the right 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.610
 take a sword so the sword that slaps 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.070
 a contract has slowly 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.400
 which you have a taste so yes it is a plus 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.780
 for me you have a cost but not necessarily 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.239
 the opportunity to type half enough 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
 quickly so that for the touch so 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.290
 the ample bouquet launched good there I missed 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.330
 totally missed a submachine shell 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.770
 forget the shield of the special spell 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.750
 no quad which he says he saw that 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.790
 I had the shield the parts part of the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.320
 time no no nothing killed and mathieu s is 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.180
 rather well played on his part it's rather 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 well around so the money that we 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.000
 can also take so I take some 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.710
 of money and see the coins that are 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.600
 driven to the ground as soon as I 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.310
 move the pieces are behind me when 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.390
 even quite well done I find that the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.950
 player himself is pretty well entered 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.960
 for for 19h also said no stupidity 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.530
 it's because the game costs 19 years on 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.630
 target i 'll just be this bag if the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.330
 cough the little partners play who 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.850
 beaten in Canada farouk etc. must to the dag 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.740
 dag ahead of me I used the violas 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.060
 with meia when in that allows to 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.440
 throw shurikens so here's where 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.540
 I was doing my special ability for the 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.890
 so kill a little baby to heal I 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.470
 believe that an enemy who's right am 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.050
 no nonsense matter to take 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.400
 a halberd finally one even if he 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.169
 do not buy nonsense so I spend 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.180
 rarely a halberd no it's a 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.760
 halberd I think I said a 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.490
 stupidity but hey it will be so see him 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.400
 TOBAM a clause in a mouth 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.640
 tomato tossing in the air it was 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.600
 rather ugly time take the frame so 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.090
 take it the executives have swayed on 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.290
 of enemies game fight club but a few 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.990
 case then if I go to the beginning but I 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.800
 to raise it in the mouth good 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.120
 I believe that holds in hygiene a 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.500
 little bit yeah I'm here I'm staying 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.380
 concentrate one is content with second 1 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.430
 that he acquired the distance his mistakes 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.919
 roundup what is it make random 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.050
 or separately you tirade to the little ones 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.890
 downturns 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.380
 I wish it goes a little bug 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.030
 frieze bounty of the coup I had allowed to 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.300
 kill that allowed me to kill why 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.330
 rather it is rather the pursuit so there 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.919
 guy he 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.120
 which carries on oneself who took a 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.970
 other direction is still going on 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.340
 we at the bazooka couple who by the way 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.000
 confessed of the key couple who allowed to 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.250
 to fall to the ground 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.219
 fucking fucking ammo in the car 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.050
 mavericks shield the hac to jump 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.810
 over a year and a half the macedo rab so 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.050
 ok so in autistic mode want by 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.139
 all 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.560
 I am here I was on the way 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.500
 stylists 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.729
 it was a little bit autistic 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.270
 on this moment I could have done 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.620
 a lot better so I do not know one 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.419
 knows where the enemies are in 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.310
 can we hear them we did not 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.800
 if you expect the sound of the game I have 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.509
 the emirate a little bit to 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.789
 hear my voice I know I have a voice 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.190
 sexy but otherwise yeah gilles bisson of 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.449
 play at least we do not bother you too much 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.639
 with even I think you're waiting 15 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:59.259
 minimal years at home brief so in the 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.440
 old that is 0 the lush or has 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.360
 not necessarily there are shields 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.979
