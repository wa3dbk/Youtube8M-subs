00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.090
 hello everybody, your fishing policy 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.160
 I'm going to introduce you today as 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.270
 Can you do it in the wide field? 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.989
 using these onion bags a bag has 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.720
 this is in aac format in this type of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.239
 straw right 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.140
 I think who does not like 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.300
 just to make just to pray just to ahmad 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.070
 with the fishing equipment and I am 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.879
 hallucinated for making my own person 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.129
 I go equipment is to use some here 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.159
 ac / dc good you can easily find in 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.210
 markets can buy up is very cheap 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.320
 50 cents 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.980
 I have a daughter look I wore 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.810
 you can use these clotheslines there 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.470
 quietly is simply the phase 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.750
 Following 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.170
 most of them is already not sew this 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.730
 came with a posture like goal 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.750
 Braga plays inside so it stays 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:30.550
 The easier I hit the ball. 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.500
 that's right and I'll start with the part that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.260
 does not have the seam side and has a 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.940
 part of the seam side that does not 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.010
 or sewing 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.080
 so you do if you get one of the tips 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.840
 stay faithful or Pharaoh 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.650
 you give a ditch to stay firm and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 start here you doubled but 23 semed 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.060
 It begins in the middle of the handle in the braiding 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.740
 and goes the closest 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.610
 of the bairrada you get to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.690
 first make a corner where you cut or 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 correct to the same extent as 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.810
 a little more cocoa if it's very fair 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.120
 put another and it will continue until 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:22.210
 another tip is the show pretty string 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:26.580
 come back here again our one more 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.580
 We're going until the end. 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.320
 and we here at the end and are afraid or well 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.760
 close to us 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.740
 I did not even have a job there. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.970
 hand you pull the door for quite 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.420
 to believe 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:11.180
 Okay, you'll send everyone here, it's over 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:14.230
 easy going to continue the work 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.230
 I was pulling school 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.790
 We're going to stay here, it's one thing. 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.790
 this ball 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:59.950
 arriving at the end I will leave equally and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.780
 also in the very close exit of the title 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.500
 right here 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.569
 justice will not stay like this will have 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.250
 how to do in some of the accounts here 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.120
 This is the one I passed. 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:19.440
 now I'm going to do a kicking shot 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.440
 good that so on the back one's tail 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.530
 I make a tie 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.930
 today it only strengthens your search there 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:39.669
 you totally adjust other ox 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.669
 round the keys are secured so the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:49.479
 keep it close here right? 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.479
 the next same state 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.610
 yea 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 So I'll adjust it here. 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.120
 tip 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.680
 I can start until today here three 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.320
 meters of line because if I have a 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.950
 fishing mangrove I can tied 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.020
 in a tree and leaving the fish is time 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.220
 water maintenance does not confuse what is 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:42.310
 just put it here and the chaco is right it 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:46.310
 pulls the water is usually done 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.960
 usually catch the fish only if you 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.990
 want to try you can do a 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.670
 bow with stainless steel if put in the bottom one 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.070
 car in a large bag and not 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.490
 You need 9 city to close the 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.650
 reason that way the flavor we hear 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.530
 for example, the boat does not 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:08.210
 I want to live or, for example, I'm thinking. 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.220
 that I speak in the world are human from 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.340
 leg is and such 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.060
 and you're thinking here and tilapia or 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.830
 mullet from then one is cool you 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.380
 drop the fish on time because it can 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.360
 count the carbon then you're 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.370
 condition and ne 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.290
 if you are going to take text for consumption 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.150
 You're going to be fine, you'll take it right away. 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.120
 is tell me just look at the text as 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.220
 more comfortable is the luck you do not know to 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.410
 amount of small gilad fish is 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.760
 the ideal is to take the middle and 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.370
 small and large 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.410
 then you to pack if you go 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.330
 releasing every hour you will end 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.940
 counting the kisses to the building after falling 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.310
 so I think the legal thing about fishing is 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.190
 Do you fish more sporty? 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.750
 is no crime at all if you take a 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.960
 fish for you to eat with your family 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.210
 immediate consumption ok then you take a 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.120
 end of the fishing there you select that 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.569
 which is in measure leads and the others you 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.330
 loose that gathered 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.349
 works here on your cell phone ok in this 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.479
