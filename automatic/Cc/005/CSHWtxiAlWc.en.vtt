accuracy test we're going to keep the
same<00:02:43.350> battery<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:43.920> switch<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.430> 2.25

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850

so<00:02:47.640> let's<00:02:47.790> go<00:02:47.880> ahead<00:02:48.120> fire<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.660> about<00:02:48.840> 110<00:02:49.410> feet

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
so let's go ahead fire in about 110 feet

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.400 
so let's go ahead fire in about 110 feet
see<00:02:50.040> how<00:02:50.130> accurate<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.760> gun<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.330> alright<00:02:52.260> so

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
see how accurate this gun is alright so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
see how accurate this gun is alright so

accurate

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:41.240 
accurate
let's<00:03:29.250> try<00:03:29.489> full<00:03:29.820> auto<00:03:39.560> same<00:03:40.560> thing<00:03:40.860> looking

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
let's try full auto same thing looking

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.590 
let's try full auto same thing looking
pretty<00:03:41.459> accurate

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.990 

alright<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.810> accuracy<00:03:46.350> wise<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:47.070> King<00:03:47.250> RS<00:03:47.459> p90

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
alright so accuracy wise the King RS p90

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.490 
alright so accuracy wise the King RS p90
isn't<00:03:48.450> looking<00:03:48.720> half<00:03:48.900> bad

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
