versions of this shoe what differences
have<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> noticed<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.109> far<00:00:25.730> well<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> new

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
have you noticed so far well in the new

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.689 
have you noticed so far well in the new
2000<00:00:27.630> series<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.990> definitely<00:00:28.320> noticed<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:29.609> an

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
2000 series I definitely noticed just an

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939 
2000 series I definitely noticed just an
overall<00:00:29.970> sleeker<00:00:30.330> fit<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.320> shoe<00:00:31.500> seam<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
overall sleeker fit the shoe seam is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.120 
overall sleeker fit the shoe seam is
more<00:00:32.160> responsive<00:00:33.170> being<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.380> Asics<00:00:34.829> dropped

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
more responsive being that Asics dropped

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.459 
more responsive being that Asics dropped
it<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> 10<00:00:36.180> mil<00:00:36.329> drop<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.809> definitely<00:00:37.260> think

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it to a 10 mil drop I definitely think

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.889 
it to a 10 mil drop I definitely think
that<00:00:37.969> affected<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> fit<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.540> made<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that affected the fit and made it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.139 
that affected the fit and made it
quicker<00:00:40.140> off<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> toe<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.850> smoother

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
quicker off the toe and just a smoother

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
quicker off the toe and just a smoother
transition<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.920> basically

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
transition all with you just basically

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
transition all with you just basically
amped<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> made<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.480> more<00:00:45.660> performance

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
amped it up and made it more performance

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.709 
amped it up and made it more performance
oriented<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> fit<00:00:48.390> did<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
oriented and what about the fit did you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.549 
oriented and what about the fit did you
notice<00:00:49.020> any<00:00:49.200> differences<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.370> did

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
notice any differences with that I did

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
notice any differences with that I did
the<00:00:52.559> upper<00:00:53.129> itself<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.270> more

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the upper itself is a little more

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
the upper itself is a little more
shallow<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.500> gives<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
shallow so it just gives you a really

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
shallow so it just gives you a really
nice<00:00:56.370> hugged<00:00:56.699> fit<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.539> overlays<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
nice hugged fit the overlays are a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.250 
nice hugged fit the overlays are a
little<00:00:58.530> bit<00:00:58.710> lighter<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.640> also<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
little bit lighter and also it's just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
little bit lighter and also it's just
more<00:01:01.590> plush<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> materials<00:01:02.579> involved

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
more plush the materials involved

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.530 
more plush the materials involved
they're<00:01:03.379> way<00:01:04.379> more<00:01:04.409> comfortable<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.119> not

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
they're way more comfortable not as not

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
they're way more comfortable not as not
as<00:01:06.570> heavy<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.590> foot<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> makes<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
as heavy on your foot and makes it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.149 
as heavy on your foot and makes it
definitely<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> lighter<00:01:09.330> feel<00:01:09.890> Callie<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
definitely a lighter feel Callie you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
definitely a lighter feel Callie you
typically<00:01:11.520> run<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.119> moderate<00:01:12.600> support<00:01:12.780> shoes

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
typically run in moderate support shoes

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.410 
typically run in moderate support shoes
how<00:01:13.799> does<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> 2000<00:01:14.580> compare<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
how does the 2000 compare for you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
how does the 2000 compare for you
well<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> found<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.850> particular<00:01:18.360> shoe

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
well I found that this particular shoe

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
well I found that this particular shoe
offered<00:01:19.259> quite<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> bit<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.130> stability<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
offered quite a bit of stability and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.630 
offered quite a bit of stability and
support<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.720> tend<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> overpronate<00:01:22.710> that's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
support as I tend to overpronate that's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.980 
support as I tend to overpronate that's
one<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.240> definitely<00:01:24.810> always

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
one thing that I'm definitely always

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
one thing that I'm definitely always
looking<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.280> other<00:01:26.430> thing<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
looking for the other thing that I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
looking for the other thing that I
noticed<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> shoe<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.320> wasn't<00:01:28.619> too

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
noticed about the shoe is it wasn't too

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
noticed about the shoe is it wasn't too
firm<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.520> offered<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> stability<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
firm it offered the stability but it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
firm it offered the stability but it
wasn't<00:01:30.869> too<00:01:30.960> firm<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.100> found<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.150> was

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
wasn't too firm I found that there was

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
wasn't too firm I found that there was
enough<00:01:33.509> cushioning<00:01:34.020> throughout<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> midsole

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
enough cushioning throughout the midsole

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
enough cushioning throughout the midsole
to<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> balance<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to kind of balance that out and so the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
to kind of balance that out and so the
combination<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:38.100> gave<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> super

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
combination of that really gave a super

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
combination of that really gave a super
smoother<00:01:39.119> ride<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:40.049> did<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> cushioning

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
smoother ride and how did the cushioning

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
smoother ride and how did the cushioning
perform<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.520> yeah<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.750> thing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
perform for you yeah that's one thing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
perform for you yeah that's one thing
that<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> definitely<00:01:43.200> did<00:01:43.770> notice<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.340> liked<00:01:44.850> how

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that I definitely did notice I liked how

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
that I definitely did notice I liked how
the<00:01:45.030> cushioning<00:01:45.630> offset<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> stability<00:01:46.920> as

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the cushioning offset the stability as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.539 
the cushioning offset the stability as
