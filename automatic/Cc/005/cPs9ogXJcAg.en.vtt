00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 all right 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.430
 hi how creative are my name is 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.100
 but today we are going to learn to 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.170
 make these delicious strawberry rolls 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.330
 which are super fast and easy 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.790
 to do if you want to know how to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.110
 Do not miss this video 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.680
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.630
 to be our strawberry rolls are 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.910
 white bread this bread that I occupy is for 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:40.210
 make your sandwich is cinnamon sugar in 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:45.430
 hazelnut cream powder 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.050
 whipped cream or chantilly cream and strawberries 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.079
 remember that strawberries should go 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.379
 washed and disinfected now let's 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.769
 see how we do the first thing we have 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:01.019
 what to do is give the leaves to our 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.019
 step since they will not serve us 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.230
 this we are going to do with all the loaves 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.920
 good with all the rolls that you 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.920
 want to do 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.530
 so must your loaves and coughs be 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.390
 after we've finished with 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.700
 our white bread we will continue with 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 our dams the strawberries what are we going 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.369
 to do with them is to cut them in 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.060
 small cubes so they can fit 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.810
 in our rolls in territory 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 obvious forestry 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.690
 Now what we are going to do is our 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.630
 mix to cover our rolls of 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.770
 strawberry we're going to need a spoonful of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 cinnamon powder 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.670
 or to your liking the attitude of action of 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.040
 cinnamon and two tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 also there is your preference that they are 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.560
 sweets 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.560
 I would like them 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.470
 Now what we are going to do is already form 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.960
 our rolls we are going to take a 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.000
 piece of our white bread and I'm going to 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.400
 give a tip so that you are not too hard 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.760
 This can be crushed 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.760
 so that when it comes to folding it does not break 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.120
 now let's put 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.489
 some cream of hazelnuts on 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.489
 center that is the center 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.720
 and we will go 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.720
 spreading 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.850
 then let's put some strawberry 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.480
 where is your hazelnut cream 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.960
 and let's roll up 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.870
 and we reserve and make another roll but 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.940
 now with 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.940
 many cream 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.510
 and so we are going to do with all the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.030
 rolls that you want 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.280
 since I have all your shaped rolls 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.689
 now let's move on in the mix 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.079
 previous that we made sugar with 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.079
 cinnamon 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.020
 We're going to be turning 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.190
 incorporate all the sugar or you can 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.180
 follow the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.180
 and sprinkling 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.090
 if you do not like cinnamon you can only 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.090
 do it with sugar 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.700
 x 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.090
