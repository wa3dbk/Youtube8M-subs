supposed to leave it for a second but
here<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:18.170> we'll<00:02:19.170> grab<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> paper<00:02:19.590> towel<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.190> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
here we go we'll grab a paper towel in a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:42.070 
here we go we'll grab a paper towel in a
second<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.940> we'll<00:02:21.300> let<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.569> sit

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.520 

it<00:02:43.080> seems<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.140> its<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.530> it's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
it seems to be all of its if it's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.240 
it seems to be all of its if it's
absorbing<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.860> sugar

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
absorbing the sugar

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:59.570 
absorbing the sugar
I<00:02:57.380> think<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.470> absorbing<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> sugar<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.460> it's

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
I think it's absorbing the sugar so it's

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.660 
I think it's absorbing the sugar so it's
been<00:02:59.700> about<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> little<00:03:00.630> over<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.870> minute<00:03:01.080> now
