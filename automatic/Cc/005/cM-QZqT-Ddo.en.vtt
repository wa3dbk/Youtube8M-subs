00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.960 
focusing on the Meza bio now this is
something<00:00:54.810> I<00:00:55.100> specifically<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.370> hoping<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970

see<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> title<00:00:57.780> update<00:00:57.900> 19<00:00:58.530> however<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> was

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
see in title update 19 however it was

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.980 
see in title update 19 however it was
never<00:00:59.550> introduced<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
never introduced and I think this is

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.660 
never introduced and I think this is
because<00:01:01.500> bull<00:01:02.070> shares<00:01:02.340> were<00:01:02.460> already

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
because bull shares were already

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
because bull shares were already
introducing<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.570> whole<00:01:03.870> range<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.469> things<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
introducing a whole range of things so

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
introducing a whole range of things so

a<00:01:25.740> huge<00:01:26.249> mess<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> volume<00:01:27.179> on<00:01:27.390> minecraft<00:01:27.960> PC

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
a huge mess of volume on minecraft PC

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.800 
a huge mess of volume on minecraft PC
now<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.770> minecraft<00:01:29.159> PC<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.119> biomes<00:01:30.539> are

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
now on minecraft PC the biomes are

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
now on minecraft PC the biomes are
actually<00:01:31.560> super<00:01:32.069> rare<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.609> I<00:01:32.670> read<00:01:32.880> them<00:01:33.030> find

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
actually super rare and I read them find

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
actually super rare and I read them find
many<00:01:33.539> of<00:01:33.749> them<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.109> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.469> find<00:01:34.649> them<00:01:34.920> then

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
many of them so if you do find them then

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.459 
many of them so if you do find them then
count<00:01:35.520> yourself<00:01:35.850> lucky<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.479> red<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.439> i

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
count yourself lucky they are red but i

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.499 
count yourself lucky they are red but i
think<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> ice<00:01:38.280> spike<00:01:38.609> biome<00:01:38.969> is<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.210> little

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
think the ice spike biome is a little

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.239 
think the ice spike biome is a little
bit<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:39.810> rarer<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.649> that's<00:01:40.950> even<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.219> word

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
bit more rarer if that's even a word

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.459 
bit more rarer if that's even a word
anyway<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.060> biome<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.539> huge<00:01:42.929> it<00:01:43.259> really

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
anyway this biome is huge it really

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.899 
anyway this biome is huge it really
really<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.770> huge<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.249> would<00:01:44.429> imagine<00:01:44.520> on

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

it when is it going to be introduced

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.630

well<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.320> hoping<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.890> see<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.220> title<00:02:39.550> update

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
well I was hoping to see in title update

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.910 
well I was hoping to see in title update
19<00:02:40.150> however<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:40.690> shares<00:02:41.140> didn't<00:02:41.590> introduce

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
19 however for shares didn't introduce

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.500 
19 however for shares didn't introduce
it<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.550> only<00:02:42.640> reason<00:02:42.730> why<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:43.330> they

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
it and the only reason why I think they

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.600 
it and the only reason why I think they
didn't<00:02:43.750> introduce<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.560> because<00:02:45.400> they<00:02:45.430> were

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
didn't introduce it is because they were

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.340 
didn't introduce it is because they were
already<00:02:45.850> introducing<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.660> whole<00:02:46.870> range<00:02:47.080> of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
already introducing a whole range of

things<00:02:51.760> like<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.210> now<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.690> messy<00:02:53.020> biome

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
things like that now in a messy biome

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
things like that now in a messy biome
you<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.190> find<00:02:54.460> things<00:02:54.820> like<00:02:54.940> dead<00:02:55.330> fish

minecraft xbox one and playstation 4 the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.449 
minecraft xbox one and playstation 4 the
biome<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.680> gonna<00:03:35.890> be<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> little<00:03:36.160> bit<00:03:36.280> bigger

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
biome is gonna be a little bit bigger

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.370 
biome is gonna be a little bit bigger
than<00:03:36.610> 360<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.300> playstation<00:03:37.810> 3<00:03:37.990> but<00:03:38.110> look<00:03:38.260> at

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
than 360 and playstation 3 but look at

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.500 
than 360 and playstation 3 but look at
that<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.800> perfect<00:03:39.220> example<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.910> how<00:03:40.450> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that that's a perfect example of how the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.810 
that that's a perfect example of how the
stained<00:03:40.810> clay<00:03:41.080> work<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:41.560> there<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.800> sifted<00:03:42.489> six

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
stained clay work so there is sifted six

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.180 
stained clay work so there is sifted six
different<00:03:43.390> stained<00:03:44.020> clay<00:03:44.440> colors<00:03:44.890> i<00:03:44.920> believe

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
different stained clay colors i believe

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.060 
different stained clay colors i believe
it's<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.370> red<00:03:45.640> orange<00:03:46.150> white<00:03:46.890> brown<00:03:48.480> black<00:03:49.480> I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
it's like red orange white brown black I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
it's like red orange white brown black I
think<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.130> can't<00:03:51.340> remember<00:03:51.580> all<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> colors

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
red and you can use it for a different

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.550 
red and you can use it for a different
thing<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.360> think<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:25.600> is<00:04:25.660> it<00:04:25.870> yes<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.440> is

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
thing I think this is it yes it is it is

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.450 
thing I think this is it yes it is it is
it<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.770> because

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
it is because

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.029 
it is because
you<00:04:27.550> can<00:04:27.669> actually<00:04:27.850> grow<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.860> sugarcane<00:04:29.860> on

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
you can actually grow and sugarcane on

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.650 
you can actually grow and sugarcane on
there<00:04:30.190> as<00:04:30.280> well<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.490> sugarcane<00:04:31.120> grows<00:04:31.389> here

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
there as well so sugarcane grows here

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.270 
there as well so sugarcane grows here
which<00:04:32.229> is<00:04:32.380> awesome<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.889> think<00:04:33.069> this<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
which is awesome I think this is the

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.590 
which is awesome I think this is the
biome<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.699> everyone<00:04:33.940> else<00:04:34.060> wants<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.330> say<00:04:34.419> as

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
biome that everyone else wants to say as

there<00:05:05.860> it's<00:05:05.979> quickly<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.430> an<00:05:06.690> see<00:05:07.690> if<00:05:07.750> he'll

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
there it's quickly just an see if he'll

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.240 
there it's quickly just an see if he'll
let<00:05:07.900> me<00:05:08.050> do<00:05:08.259> this<00:05:08.410> let's<00:05:08.620> just<00:05:08.889> create<00:05:09.160> a

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
let me do this let's just create a

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.700 
let me do this let's just create a
crafting<00:05:09.729> table<00:05:09.759> here<00:05:10.360> put<00:05:10.900> this<00:05:11.020> here<00:05:11.229> let's

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
crafting table here put this here let's

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.080 
crafting table here put this here let's
see<00:05:11.860> what<00:05:11.979> we'll<00:05:12.130> do<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.340> think<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.759> does<00:05:12.910> turn

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
see what we'll do I think it does turn

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.640 
see what we'll do I think it does turn
into<00:05:13.449> yes<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.750> does<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.050> makes<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.410> red

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
into yes it does it makes a red

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.930 
into yes it does it makes a red
sandstone<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.280> hopefully<00:05:15.550> they<00:05:15.669> can<00:05:15.729> also

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
sandstone so hopefully they can also

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.640 
sandstone so hopefully they can also
introduce<00:05:16.240> red<00:05:16.690> sandstone<00:05:16.900> as<00:05:17.320> well<00:05:17.500> as<00:05:17.590> you

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
introduce red sandstone as well as you

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.170 
introduce red sandstone as well as you
can<00:05:17.770> see<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.070> looks<00:05:18.160> wonderful<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:19.030> looks

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
can see it looks wonderful it looks

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.370 
can see it looks wonderful it looks
exactly<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.900> same<00:05:19.960> as<00:05:20.289> a<00:05:20.380> normal<00:05:21.310> well<00:05:22.270> normal

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
exactly the same as a normal well normal

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.990 
exactly the same as a normal well normal
sandstone<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.710> mean<00:05:24.159> a<00:05:24.340> lot<00:05:24.400> of<00:05:24.610> people<00:05:24.669> have

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
sandstone so I mean a lot of people have

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.370 
sandstone so I mean a lot of people have
been<00:05:25.060> asking<00:05:25.210> me<00:05:25.539> what<00:05:25.720> by<00:05:25.870> them<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.139> I<00:05:26.199> like

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
been asking me what by them to I like

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.140 
been asking me what by them to I like
best<00:05:26.590> this<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.919> probably<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.370> biome<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:27.849> like

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
best this is probably the biome I like

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.180 
best this is probably the biome I like
best<00:05:28.389> because<00:05:28.750> it's<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.050> much<00:05:29.229> more<00:05:29.409> useful<00:05:29.650> if

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190
