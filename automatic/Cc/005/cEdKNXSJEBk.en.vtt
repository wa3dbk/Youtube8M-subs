Surrey and as you can see in the middle
we've<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> crackerjack<00:00:13.170> symbol<00:00:13.650> he<00:00:13.710> says

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we've got the crackerjack symbol he says

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.919 
we've got the crackerjack symbol he says
next<00:00:14.130> wind<00:00:14.460> pays<00:00:14.790> thinking<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.719> paid

next wind pays thinking I have paid

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.920 
next wind pays thinking I have paid
either<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.470> four<00:00:17.430> or<00:00:17.460> six<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.420> about<00:00:18.750> in

the sixties you know I remember seeing

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.859 
the sixties you know I remember seeing
this<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.580> when<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.270> used<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> go<00:00:21.570> down<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this in when we used to go down to the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.040 
this in when we used to go down to the
arcade<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.830> popular<00:00:23.010> machine<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
arcade it was a very popular machine and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:53.000 
arcade it was a very popular machine and
we're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> show<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.410> how<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.710> works<00:00:52.010> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
we're going to show you how it works you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.900 
we're going to show you how it works you
turn<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:54.770> you<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.949> two<00:00:56.250> coins<00:00:56.579> down

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
turn this here you get two coins down

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the next thing now you can see says next

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
the next thing now you can see says next
wind<00:00:59.280> p6<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.140> used<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> look

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
wind p6 now this is what we used to look

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
wind p6 now this is what we used to look
out<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> sixties<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.489> kids<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:02.940> went

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
out for the sixties as kids when we went

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
out for the sixties as kids when we went
round<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:04.170> used<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> watch<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.860> machine

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
round we used to watch this machine

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
round we used to watch this machine
because<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.489> came<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> saw<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.330> with

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
because if we came up we saw this with

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
because if we came up we saw this with
next<00:01:06.750> wing<00:01:06.930> p6<00:01:07.820> obviously<00:01:09.860> there'd<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> nice

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
next wing p6 obviously there'd be a nice

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
next wing p6 obviously there'd be a nice
prop<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.790> we've<00:01:11.939> got<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> wing<00:01:12.330> pretty<00:01:12.600> early

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
prop in if we've got a wing pretty early

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:41.170 
prop in if we've got a wing pretty early
on<00:01:24.500> looky<00:01:25.500> there

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.429 

you<00:01:42.180> won't<00:01:42.360> guaranteed<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> get

you won't guaranteed you know to get

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.539 
you won't guaranteed you know to get
anything<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.979> was<00:01:44.070> always<00:01:44.189> better<00:01:44.490> to

in<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> sixties<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.780> came<00:02:22.049> in<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> arcades

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
in the sixties we came in the arcades

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.860 
in the sixties we came in the arcades
and<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.700> approached<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.269> machine<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.660> he

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and I approached this machine that he

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.350 
and I approached this machine that he
said<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.440> turn<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:27.209> know

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
said that on turn we know you know

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.699 
said that on turn we know you know
somebody<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.780> obviously<00:02:28.140> got<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> winner<00:02:28.560> on

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
somebody it obviously got a winner on

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.830 
somebody it obviously got a winner on
eternity<00:02:29.190> once<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> 60s<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.660> made<00:02:30.810> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
eternity once so in the 60s we made a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.720 
eternity once so in the 60s we made a
few<00:02:31.080> extra<00:02:31.350> Topsy's<00:02:31.769> by<00:02:31.920> finding<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.549> that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
few extra Topsy's by finding in that

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
few extra Topsy's by finding in that
position<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.110> came<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.750> they've

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
position and we just came up and they've

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.539 
position and we just came up and they've
got<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.049> extra<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:37.860> want<00:02:38.130> more<00:02:38.250> spin

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
got the extra to well I want more spin

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.400 
got the extra to well I want more spin
out<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.880> show<00:02:39.030> ya<00:02:44.930> nice-looking<00:02:45.930> machine<00:02:46.019> that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
out to show ya nice-looking machine that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.729 
out to show ya nice-looking machine that
and<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:46.739> travel<00:02:47.100> Jack<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> usual
