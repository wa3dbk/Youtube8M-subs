00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
 If I had continued to adapt 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:21.200
 and there they are just giving programs with 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.200
 Format 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.980
 in the unbalanced way 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.530
 you listened very well 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:56.600
 This question 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.480
 that's why it looks like it's too big 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.480
 he is impolite 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 the program told me that I have not 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 time to lose with you 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.660
 it's not what she does and what she expressed 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.930
 also in defense that seemed like a 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:44.800
 journalist that I did the lathe upside down 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.800
 that I said that everything I said 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.710
 when he was driving the angel 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.380
 it was normally in the world the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.579
 show leads us angel healthy as well 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.619
 Well, also their children 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.390
 let's say you formed these rumors in 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.400
 you marked the time angela is 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:31.569
 doing with your veil is marking a 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:33.860
 time also of the inability to 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.680
 batiste because I can not think ground 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 opposite with the driver with me 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.019
 it's all good to leave it there 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.430
 I'm not a question, the videos have 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.380
 been able to work in this channel we are going to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.030
 pass the video the optician 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.030
 for me 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.690
 in this situation apart we invite you 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.830
 so that you will have a good time 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.830
 we have to keep going 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.920
 the personality 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 'is for you' we see that the morning of 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.280
