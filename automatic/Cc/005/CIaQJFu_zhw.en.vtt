00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 removable I think I put the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.770
 my lipsticks in here from here because those 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.940
 where all my lipsticks fit then I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.680
 I decided to put them here and there the streets. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.289
 ask but how do you know how it is? 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 makeup and that's it you're there 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 interested in seeing the same room as 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 rossa series as you can organize 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.130
 lipsticks here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.380
 the shakhtar can put them so it is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.850
 It's true, but you can see the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 name of each button 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 that way when you go get them 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.110
 Can you see what lipstick you're going on? 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.390
 pick up because mac lipsticks they have 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.579
 a little name of them is written here in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 It's ok, but I do not like it that way. 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
 issues that are my own 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.490
 neighborhood, but how do you make lipsticks? 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.820
 The amec has the names face down 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 How, then, am I going to leave this one here?

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.530

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.780
 especially I have those here sometimes and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.240
 stopped the other one there so I get to 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.420

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.980

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.489
 money here we do not have the first 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.930
 row of little faces here begin the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.060
 red and now I'm going to the roses 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.770
 Do not forget you have video with 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.780
 Roses have video with the reds in 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.560
 video nude lipstick has video editing 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.540
 limited so now let's choose 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.580
 Let's put all the pink lipsticks here. 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.310
 so it's now that we have the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.300
 last two divisions I've been 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.209
 doing what are nudes and roses like 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.859
 You can see I have enough. 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:23.200
 Nude lipstick and lots of pink lipstick 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.889
 so I start with the pink color I 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.990
 I'm putting 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:32.680
 that nine hysterical even wanted lion is 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.080
 So, here is the part that 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.210
 are the nude lipsticks that then start to 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.830
 place from here to where you have 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.629
 place here in the other row 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.580
 the Flemish is he is a little coral but I 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.560
 I can not do a single session 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.909
 coral because I do not have many corals 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.490
 so I left the set 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:56.919
 chay sexy hanna irritated is also kind of 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.379
 kind of a little coral he'll come back to 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.169
 categories will come back in on the collection of 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:05.770

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.189
 so here we only have two red 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.729
 rows of red rose in the last 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.889
 two 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.289
 these first two here are many 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.900
 so when I go look for a lipstick 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.490
 nude I seek I already know the region more 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.849

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:29.169
 with the limited editions coati student 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:32.409
 When I come here, it's neither the back nor the back. 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:37.379
 the red roses and start a 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.819

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.550

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.550
 open 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:14.469
 then we end this is how 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:17.199
 It organizes for those who were asking 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.659
 How would I do it to find the lipsticks? 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.699
 so the very private organization my 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.560
 many people farms stay would be very 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.979
 more practical face- up 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.250
 I know I know but I do not want it 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.839

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.220
