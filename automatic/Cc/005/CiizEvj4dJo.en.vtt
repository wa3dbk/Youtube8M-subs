00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:33.430
 but then daan 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.430
 first that this is the scrub think 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 fabric blueprint and yes I have chosen 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.970
 I thought the bowl was very nice first 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.800
 what the let me see him is so such 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.920
 10 m no that your view do double what I do 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.830
 there and what you have to do to scuf 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.210
 kobe â€‹â€‹japan what you get by talking about god 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:59.180
 but I had this first 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.960
 this nice and if you know who scored and 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.230
 he is with pot and and we look at what was 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.580
 it this one to no 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.850
 type of stupid that is broken that is torn 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.380
 at home and again not see well and so 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.580
 I have these and all I will she would 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.030
 tell him what I have done 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.900
 so right on I loft so one 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.000
 playstation stick and the only difference 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.660
 it is that it is a prezi choke 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.830
 its not an xbox tick and flour or it 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 and all black missing buttons 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.930
 Hawkman also that very nice with it 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.360
 layout of this and when I put it on 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.739
 then I have blue lighting according to 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.370
 me around it instead of a green one 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.340
 lighting that cap is matched with to 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.520
 parts thereof say 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.560
 So that's my request back see 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.780
 the paddles that they also design with it 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.739
 front of a layout is another such 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.570
 Fat 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.830
 as you can see here so one 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.080
 triggers' tops 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.700
 so when I want very fast 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.640
 shoot say after the lip team of 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.820
 very quickly and therefore granty 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.590
 when it really shoots right now 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.209
 sjaak but then he shoots and you do 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.670
 not to press all the way 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.880
 Shaft applies for the LT you can get faster 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 a menzo blah blah and it's all 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.410
 on how full by 10 games 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.690
 and yes it is just here or you so yes 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.880
 I have now turned around but this is the 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.800
 chapel or the year paddle and 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.320
 and with that jumping bus him with the 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 Judge who is so dropshot 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.390
 and I deliberately did so because of that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.310
 I 'm used to say so and that is 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.140
 actually all you need 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.650
 I have the rest for help 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.650
 taken out 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.280
 that is, so that it becomes slightly lighter 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.010
 I think and I have one 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.870
 Fans are taken because they are the fish stock 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.420
 from the control to the xbox then something 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.250
 faster is say 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.610
 so that's basically it 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.410
 only where now scrub peter say for you 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.660
 but and are just whole cheape 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.600
 he also checks how much light there is 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.770
 compared to a standard xbox 360 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.340
 controller 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.960
 so yes that they are actually my scuf 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.080
 chemistry of brooks a video I know him 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.550
 very, very beautiful, beautiful that they are 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.130
 have had so far and there I have 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.050
 and I got rid of a good working scuf 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.400
 to 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.010
 so yes i hope you like this video 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.820

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.420
