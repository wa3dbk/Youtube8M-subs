$300,000 house that's like five thousand

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.430 
$300,000 house that's like five thousand
dollars<00:03:31.090> maybe<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.840> little<00:03:31.959> bit<00:03:32.139> more<00:03:32.260> than

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
dollars maybe a little bit more than

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.840 
dollars maybe a little bit more than
five<00:03:32.590> thousand<00:03:32.920> dollars<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.250> don't<00:03:33.430> know<00:03:33.489> don't

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
five thousand dollars I don't know don't

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.759 
five thousand dollars I don't know don't
that's<00:03:34.329> my<00:03:34.480> mental<00:03:34.810> math<00:03:34.930> whatever<00:03:35.260> that's<00:03:35.680> a

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that's my mental math whatever that's a

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.500 
that's my mental math whatever that's a
lot<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:35.950> money<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:36.519> kind<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.000> throw<00:03:37.329> out

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
lot of money to just kind of throw out

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.660 
lot of money to just kind of throw out
there<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.959> be<00:03:38.019> like<00:03:38.170> here<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.500> go<00:03:38.650> because<00:03:39.280> we

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
there and be like here you go because we

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.089 
there and be like here you go because we
don't<00:03:39.819> have<00:03:39.910> twenty<00:03:40.299> percent<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.859> get<00:03:42.010> to

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
don't have twenty percent and to get to

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.860 
don't have twenty percent and to get to
twenty<00:03:42.370> percent<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.060> average<00:03:43.480> house<00:03:43.690> in

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
twenty percent of the average house in

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.309 
twenty percent of the average house in
Toronto<00:03:44.319> we<00:03:44.920> would<00:03:45.069> have<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.250> have<00:03:45.609> saved<00:03:45.880> over

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
Toronto we would have to have saved over

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.069 
Toronto we would have to have saved over
$80,000<00:03:47.319> so<00:03:47.880> that's<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:49.000> lot<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.180> money<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.660> we

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
$80,000 so that's a lot of money and we

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.750 
$80,000 so that's a lot of money and we
will<00:03:50.230> not<00:03:50.349> be<00:03:50.410> saving<00:03:50.889> that<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.370> next<00:03:51.489> nine

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
will not be saving that in the next nine

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.150 
will not be saving that in the next nine
months<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:52.599> what<00:03:53.230> we<00:03:53.319> realized<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.859> is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
months and so what we realized is is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.520 
months and so what we realized is is
that<00:03:54.370> our<00:03:54.579> goal<00:03:54.849> should<00:03:55.180> kind<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.959> change<00:03:56.200> from

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that our goal should kind of change from

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.740 
that our goal should kind of change from
being<00:03:57.519> able<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.849> save<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.209> house<00:03:58.329> in<00:03:58.480> toronto

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
being able to save for house in toronto

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.140 
being able to save for house in toronto

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.939 
and that is exactly when we're going to
move<00:05:36.150> into<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:36.780> how<00:05:37.199> long<00:05:37.349> will<00:05:37.560> rent<00:05:37.830> it

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.460 
move into it and how long will rent it
for<00:05:38.130> oracle<00:05:38.729> rented<00:05:39.060> at<00:05:39.150> all<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:40.199> know<00:05:40.289> maybe

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
for oracle rented at all you know maybe

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.870 
for oracle rented at all you know maybe
we'll<00:05:40.710> just<00:05:40.860> leave<00:05:41.009> it<00:05:41.099> empty<00:05:41.220> for<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.580> bit<00:05:41.699> and

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
we'll just leave it empty for a bit and

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.670 
we'll just leave it empty for a bit and
do<00:05:42.030> some<00:05:42.060> renovations<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:42.960> pains<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:43.440> stuff

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
do some renovations and pains and stuff

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.140 
do some renovations and pains and stuff
so<00:05:43.889> we<00:05:43.979> don't<00:05:44.159> have<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.400> actually<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:45.120> know

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
so we don't have to actually you know

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.310 
so we don't have to actually you know
worry<00:05:45.449> about<00:05:45.599> doing<00:05:45.810> that<00:05:45.870> one<00:05:46.050> more<00:05:46.169> in<00:05:46.289> there

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
worry about doing that one more in there

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.460 
worry about doing that one more in there
so<00:05:46.949> I<00:05:47.250> don't<00:05:47.580> know<00:05:47.909> exactly<00:05:48.900> what<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.229> plan<00:05:49.440> is

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
so I don't know exactly what the plan is

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.850 
so I don't know exactly what the plan is
but<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.310> do<00:05:50.460> know<00:05:50.729> that<00:05:51.030> hopefully<00:05:51.960> if<00:05:52.229> we<00:05:52.500> find

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
but I do know that hopefully if we find

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.740 
but I do know that hopefully if we find
the<00:05:52.949> right<00:05:53.099> place<00:05:53.370> within<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:54.060> next<00:05:54.240> month<00:05:54.419> or
