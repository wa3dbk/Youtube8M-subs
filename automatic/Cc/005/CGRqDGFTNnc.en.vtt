doing the job right but sometimes you

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.610 
doing the job right but sometimes you
end<00:00:15.730> up<00:00:15.879> paying<00:00:16.090> twice<00:00:16.360> if<00:00:16.720> you<00:00:16.870> use<00:00:16.900> a<00:00:17.200> cheaper

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
end up paying twice if you use a cheaper

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.300 
end up paying twice if you use a cheaper
parts<00:00:17.830> or<00:00:19.199> basically<00:00:20.199> try<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.619> avoid<00:00:21.250> that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
parts or basically try to avoid that

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.609 
parts or basically try to avoid that
fixing<00:00:22.150> that<00:00:22.240> particular<00:00:22.960> thing<00:00:23.289> at<00:00:23.500> that

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
fixing that particular thing at that

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.140 
fixing that particular thing at that
same<00:00:23.830> time<00:00:23.859> and<00:00:24.250> you<00:00:24.310> think<00:00:24.580> you<00:00:24.670> can<00:00:24.820> do<00:00:24.939> it<00:00:25.029> in

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
same time and you think you can do it in

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.570 
same time and you think you can do it in
six<00:00:25.330> months<00:00:25.570> down<00:00:25.779> time<00:00:26.320> but<00:00:26.560> sometimes<00:00:27.250> they

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
six months down time but sometimes they

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.249 
six months down time but sometimes they
can<00:00:27.760> come<00:00:27.939> back<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.300> make<00:00:28.750> even<00:00:29.080> bigger

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
can come back and make even bigger

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.500 
can come back and make even bigger
problem<00:00:29.740> for<00:00:29.769> you<00:00:30.039> so<00:00:30.759> make<00:00:31.720> sure<00:00:31.750> that<00:00:32.020> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
problem for you so make sure that you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.080 
problem for you so make sure that you
you<00:00:34.510> know<00:00:34.800> try<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.860> do<00:00:36.160> is<00:00:36.489> whatever<00:00:36.850> it's

you know try to do is whatever it's
recommended<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.750> right<00:00:37.930> time<00:00:38.200> that<00:00:38.890> save<00:00:39.280> you

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
recommended the right time that save you

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.010 
recommended the right time that save you
some<00:00:39.610> money<00:00:39.640> down<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.180> line<00:00:40.360> you<00:00:40.390> don't<00:00:40.690> you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
some money down the line you don't you

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.779 
some money down the line you don't you
know<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.200> think<00:00:41.770> you're<00:00:41.890> saving<00:00:42.100> money<00:00:42.430> not

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
know you think you're saving money not

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.700 
know you think you're saving money not
doing<00:00:43.059> at<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.270> time<00:00:43.480> but<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:43.870> think<00:00:44.170> it's<00:00:44.289> in<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
doing at a time but I think it's in the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.020 
doing at a time but I think it's in the
end<00:00:44.920> it's<00:00:45.100> going<00:00:45.219> to<00:00:45.309> end<00:00:45.399> up<00:00:45.520> costing<00:00:45.730> you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
end it's going to end up costing you

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.860 
end it's going to end up costing you
more<00:00:46.149> money<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.660> do<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.379> later<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:49.600> their

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
more money to do it later that's their

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.240 
more money to do it later that's their
one<00:00:50.020> of<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.199> things<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:50.469> mistakes<00:00:50.949> most

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
one of the things that mistakes most

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.440 
one of the things that mistakes most
some<00:00:51.579> customers<00:00:52.059> do

go wrong if the check engine light is on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.820 
go wrong if the check engine light is on
it<00:01:17.330> could<00:01:17.540> be<00:01:17.660> one<00:01:17.870> sensor<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.440> could<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:18.650> to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
it could be one sensor it could be to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.800 
it could be one sensor it could be to
censor<00:01:19.190> it<00:01:19.220> could<00:01:19.430> be<00:01:19.520> two<00:01:20.120> three<00:01:20.360> different

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
censor it could be two three different

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.840 
censor it could be two three different
sensors<00:01:21.170> or<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.440> systems<00:01:21.830> are<00:01:21.979> causing<00:01:22.760> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
sensors or the systems are causing the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.790 
sensors or the systems are causing the
light<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.060> be<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.600> lot<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.260> people<00:01:24.470> think<00:01:24.650> if

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
light to be on a lot of people think if

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.140 
light to be on a lot of people think if
the<00:01:24.920> light<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.100> on<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.760> car<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.030> still

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
the light is on and the car is still

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.360 
the light is on and the car is still
running<00:01:26.390> fine<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.110> they<00:01:27.920> think<00:01:27.979> they<00:01:28.220> can

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
running fine and they think they can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.800 
running fine and they think they can
drive<00:01:28.580> it<00:01:28.759> for<00:01:28.910> another<00:01:29.119> six<00:01:29.390> months<00:01:29.450> without

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
drive it for another six months without

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.260 
drive it for another six months without
fixing<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.410> problem<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.729> normally<00:01:32.090> find

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
fixing the problem and we normally find

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.820 
fixing the problem and we normally find
this<00:01:32.450> when<00:01:32.750> they<00:01:32.869> come<00:01:33.050> in<00:01:33.170> for<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.320> smog<00:01:33.590> check

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
this when they come in for a smog check

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.740 
this when they come in for a smog check
so<00:01:34.130> when<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.790> come<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> small<00:01:35.509> check

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
so when you come in for a small check

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.690 
so when you come in for a small check
and<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.770> check<00:01:36.950> engine<00:01:37.070> light<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.520> it's

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and the check engine light is on it's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.640 
and the check engine light is on it's
usually<00:01:38.090> automatic<00:01:38.240> failure<00:01:38.780> when<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.440> plug

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
usually automatic failure when you plug

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.530 
usually automatic failure when you plug
in<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.190> diagnostic<00:01:40.759> machine<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.300> reads

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
in to the diagnostic machine it reads

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.999 
in to the diagnostic machine it reads
the<00:01:41.660> codes<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.080> mostly<00:01:42.410> its<00:01:42.619> emission

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the codes and mostly its emission

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.100 
the codes and mostly its emission
related<00:01:43.430> problems<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.600> could<00:01:44.720> fail<00:01:44.930> the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
related problems that could fail the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.400 
related problems that could fail the
test<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.420> just<00:01:47.420> because<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.869> light<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.350> and

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
test so just because the light is on and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.410 
test so just because the light is on and

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
things like it's a warning light so you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.260 
things like it's a warning light so you
have<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> make<00:01:55.040> sure<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.759> check<00:01:56.060> if

it's minor problem it could be solved

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.730 
it's minor problem it could be solved
with<00:01:58.100> within<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.970> know<00:01:59.200> you<00:02:00.200> know<00:02:00.320> maybe<00:02:00.560> even

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
with within you know you know maybe even

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.590 
with within you know you know maybe even
hundred<00:02:01.100> dollars<00:02:01.429> but<00:02:01.640> if<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.149> live<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.479> and

honey dollar that he can you know
address<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.979> check<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.280> July<00:02:10.490> is<00:02:10.640> very
