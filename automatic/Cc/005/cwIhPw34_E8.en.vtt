00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.080
 recent events have 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.390
 produced a widespread feeling of 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.250
 discontent and social protest that have 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.159
 mobilized to different sectors of the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.679
 Guatemalan society in the city and in 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.900
 the interior of the country with the demand for 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.480
 reforms to different laws and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.239
 purging the political class and the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.239
 three powers of the state ignore the 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.090
 manifest demands of the population in 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.359
 its citizen exercise expressed in the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.329
 current situation at the national level is a 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:41.420
 high risk the higher end is 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.120
 protect the institutionality and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.010
 advance in the urgent transformations 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.440
 in the political legal and administrative the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.589
 citizen outrage is focused without 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.460
 doubt that the public treasury is seen 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.710
 like a booty from which they take advantage 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.289
 officials and authorities 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 unscrupulous in the previous sense the 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.590
 Friday the public prosecutor and the cicig 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.990
 with serious signs that claim 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.830
 link with the case known as the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.520
 line and requested a preliminary hearing against 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.040
 my person is more they place me as the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.200
 head of the structure declared 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.229
 categorically that you rejected my 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.259
 connection to it and having 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.229
 received any money from that operation 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.430
 from fraud to gift was my conscience 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.399
 in that sense he is calm I will give the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.280
 face and I will demonstrate in front of the 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.520
 institutionality that in law corresponds 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.789
 through due process that I have not 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.250
 been part and much less recipient of 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.490
 those ill-gotten funds to the detriment of the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.130
 Guatemalan people understand the logic of 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.470
 the prosecutors but I want you to understand 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.340
 all the people of Guatemala that there is no 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.310
 one line is two and so far 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.640
 appeared the one that receives but not the one that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.069
 pay no doubt rooted in the sector 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.999
 business and I hope 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.249
 soon appear in all its given magnitude 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:23.030
 that the same investigations indicate 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:26.150
 its historical character , however, 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.819
 facts are the facts and with the same 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.250
 strength and character with which I deny my 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.700
 linkage I can not help but recognize 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.370
 that this has happened in my government and 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.280
 by nearby officials or those who 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.030
 designate this forces me to ask for a 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.790
 public apology and to say what is born 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.969
 from the bottom of my heart to ask 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.969
 sorry to the Guatemalans on the other hand 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:55.430
 It is not acceptable that in Guatemala 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:58.540
 pretend to install a strategy 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.959
 interventionist who aims 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.599
 dictate to us or not to do and to break the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.120
 democracy yes to certain sectors of the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.030
 international community and some groups 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.069
 of power in the country do not seem 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.790
 suitable candidates to direct 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.490
 guatemala must first make a 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.640
 side your particular interests 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.030
 finally see for the interest of the people and 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.500
 the Guatemalan nation will undoubtedly have 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.100
 the opportunity to control 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.560
 objectively to the next government today 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.440
 that I get the political attack and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.830
 media of these groups I tell them that 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 I will assume my responsibility and accept the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.860
 law but if something positive we have from the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.010
 events is that guatemala change 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.410
 and that change has to ensure that the law 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.410
 is for everyone equally without distinction 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.770
 some independently of the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.530
 political conjuncture in our country what 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.390
 important is that you do not break the order and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.810
 the democratic tradition of our 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.260
 people the citizenship must understand 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.760
 that the only legal way to choose 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.820
 its authorities is by way of the vote 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.209
 conscious and responsible for each and every 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.760
 one of the citizens 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.910
 compatriots I call on you to 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.150
 manifest in all its strength that 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.820
 deep guatemala 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.320
 the social organizations that 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.720
 rural guatemala that has been in the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.419
 center of my attention is to guatemala 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.340
 plural and diverse as those seen today 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.889
 never to defend our incipient 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.220
 democracy to look with optimism the future 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.740
 and do the deep transformations 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.300
 of the state that will open the way to 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.160
 a more secure, fairer guatemala more 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.000
 transparent more participatory and more 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.870
 prosperous in that perspective and in that end 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.560
 I assure you that I will not resign and 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.320
 that with all interest I will face and 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.419
 I will subject to the processes that in law 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.419
 correspond good night
