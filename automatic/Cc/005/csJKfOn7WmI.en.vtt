00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
also kind of always thought everybody

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
also kind of always thought everybody
relax<00:00:45.840> their<00:00:46.050> hair<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.950> reason<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.460> did

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
relax their hair for the reason I did

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430

but<00:00:48.090> since<00:00:48.270> being<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.570> YouTube<00:00:48.960> I've<00:00:49.200> seen

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
but since being on YouTube I've seen

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
but since being on YouTube I've seen
that<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.920> lot<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.430> people<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.940> had<00:00:51.090> other

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that a lot of people have had other

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.189 
that a lot of people have had other
reasons<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:53.510> it's<00:00:54.510> been<00:00:54.690> done<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.050> bit

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
reasons or it's been done a little bit

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040 
reasons or it's been done a little bit
differently<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.309> their<00:00:56.640> life<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> just

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
differently in their life so I just

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.979 
differently in their life so I just
think<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.260> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> interesting<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.100> know

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
think it's kind of interesting to know

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
think it's kind of interesting to know
where<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.289> decision<00:01:01.590> comes<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.579> before

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
where that decision comes from so before

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
where that decision comes from so before
I<00:01:02.879> start<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.420> wanted<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> say<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.320> if

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I start I just wanted to say that if

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380 
I start I just wanted to say that if
you're<00:01:05.070> someone<00:01:05.369> who's<00:01:05.519> rock<00:01:05.760> star<00:01:06.030> watching

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you're someone who's rock star watching

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
you're someone who's rock star watching
this<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.990> telling<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> your

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this I'm not telling you that your

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
this I'm not telling you that your
choice<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> wrong<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
choice is wrong or that you need to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
choice is wrong or that you need to
change<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.580> simply<00:01:11.880> telling<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
change it I'm just simply telling you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.330 
change it I'm just simply telling you
why<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.500> choice<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.979> me<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
why it was not the right choice for me I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.859 
why it was not the right choice for me I
think<00:01:14.760> there<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:14.970> quite<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> few<00:01:15.570> factors

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
think there are quite a few factors

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
think there are quite a few factors
which<00:01:16.170> contributed<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:17.130> decision<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
which contributed to my decision to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.289 
which contributed to my decision to
relax<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:18.840> hair<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:21.060> my

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
relax my hair I think that my

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.520 
relax my hair I think that my
environment<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.200> part<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.450> I'm<00:01:24.450> mixed

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
environment was part of it I'm mixed

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
environment was part of it I'm mixed
so<00:01:25.619> I've<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:26.180> carrot<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.509> black<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.080> one

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so I've one carrot it's black and one

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.399 
so I've one carrot it's black and one
that's<00:01:28.350> white<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.180> which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> obviously<00:01:31.140> kind

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that's white and which is obviously kind

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.920 
that's white and which is obviously kind
of<00:01:31.530> wearing<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.890> hair<00:01:32.040> texture<00:01:32.369> from<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
of wearing it my hair texture from the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.569 
of wearing it my hair texture from the
combination<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.680> parents<00:01:34.979> hair<00:01:35.159> textures

through<00:02:00.299> attention<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> me<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.229> something

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
through attention to me or something

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.929 
through attention to me or something
which<00:02:01.890> made<00:02:02.070> me<00:02:02.159> feel<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.490> embarrassed

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
which made me feel like embarrassed

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.750 
which made me feel like embarrassed
about<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.469> part<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
about it so I think that was part of it

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.010 
about it so I think that was part of it
and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.950> also<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.730> hair<00:02:08.970> was<00:02:09.210> was<00:02:09.870> much

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and then also my hair was was much

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.210 
and then also my hair was was much
larger<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.590> frizzier<00:02:11.280> than<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.610> now

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
larger and frizzier than it is now

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.680 
larger and frizzier than it is now
because<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.490> didn't<00:02:14.790> want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.970> take<00:02:15.090> care<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
because I didn't want to take care of it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
because I didn't want to take care of it
so<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> think<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> second<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.310> biggest

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so I think that the second and biggest

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.720 
so I think that the second and biggest
part<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.660> why<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.170> flex<00:02:19.980> my<00:02:20.100> hair<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
part to why I flex my hair is that I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.280 
part to why I flex my hair is that I
didn't<00:02:21.090> know<00:02:21.150> how<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.390> take<00:02:21.540> care<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:21.930> curls

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
didn't know how to take care of my curls

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.030 
didn't know how to take care of my curls
so<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.160> weren't<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.840> nice<00:02:24.840> defined<00:02:25.410> or<00:02:25.770> soft

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
so they weren't as nice defined or soft

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.730 
so they weren't as nice defined or soft
as<00:02:26.250> they<00:02:26.370> could<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.640> been<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> didn't

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
as they could have been because I didn't

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.160 
as they could have been because I didn't
know<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.950> was<00:02:29.040> doing<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.150> made<00:02:30.990> them

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
know what I was doing and it made them

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.970 
know what I was doing and it made them
look<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.280> way<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> really<00:02:32.850> didn't<00:02:33.180> like

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
look in a way that I really didn't like

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.200 
look in a way that I really didn't like
basically<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.490> middle<00:02:35.670> school<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
basically when I was in middle school I

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.390 
basically when I was in middle school I
wear<00:02:36.810> my<00:02:36.900> hair<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> ponytail<00:02:37.560> every<00:02:37.980> day<00:02:38.100> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
wear my hair in a ponytail every day and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.720 
wear my hair in a ponytail every day and
I<00:02:38.940> wash<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.570> shampoo<00:02:40.050> every<00:02:40.530> day<00:02:40.730> or

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
I wash it with shampoo every day or

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.660 
I wash it with shampoo every day or
every<00:02:41.880> night<00:02:42.150> or<00:02:42.360> whatever<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:46.670> usages

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
every night or whatever so that usages

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.630 
every night or whatever so that usages
shampoo<00:02:48.180> will<00:02:48.330> really<00:02:48.600> dry<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:48.930> my<00:02:49.080> hair<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
shampoo will really dry it out my hair I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.910 
shampoo will really dry it out my hair I
used<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.760> brush<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.630> didn't<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.110> like

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
used a brush on it I didn't really like

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.060 
used a brush on it I didn't really like
I<00:02:53.190> used<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> right<00:02:54.240> products<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.990> etc<00:02:55.140> so

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
I used the right products for it etc so

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.610 
I used the right products for it etc so
my<00:02:56.100> hair<00:02:56.520> was<00:02:56.760> frizzier<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.200> like

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
my hair was frizzier and it would like

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.670 
my hair was frizzier and it would like
it<00:02:59.430> was<00:02:59.580> like<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.880> here<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.570> not<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
it was like out here and not in like a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.580 
it was like out here and not in like a
volume<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.580> voluminous<00:03:03.330> way<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.020> because

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
volume of voluminous way but in because

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.990 
volume of voluminous way but in because
it<00:03:04.740> was<00:03:04.830> pretty<00:03:05.070> though<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.580> didn't<00:03:05.820> really

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it was pretty though I didn't really

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
it was pretty though I didn't really
like<00:03:06.120> my<00:03:06.300> curls<00:03:06.570> because<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.080> didn't<00:03:07.350> know<00:03:07.410> what

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
like my curls because I didn't know what

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.860 
like my curls because I didn't know what
take<00:03:07.710> care<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.040> them<00:03:08.220> had<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.640> known<00:03:09.510> how<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
take care of them had I known how to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.570 
take care of them had I known how to
take<00:03:10.440> care<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.680> them<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.040> no<00:03:11.190> one<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
take care of them and no one like the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.010 
take care of them and no one like the
right<00:03:11.730> products<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.240> them<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.600> stuff<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
right products for them and stuff I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.110 
right products for them and stuff I
think<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:14.010> might<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.400> been<00:03:14.610> able<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.850> like

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
think I might have been able to like

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.620 
think I might have been able to like
overcome<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.940> awkward<00:03:17.940> like<00:03:18.330> feeling

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
overcome the awkward like feeling

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.810 
overcome the awkward like feeling
awkward<00:03:18.750> about<00:03:19.020> having<00:03:19.650> hair<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.760> was

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
awkward about having hair that was

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.100 
awkward about having hair that was
different<00:03:21.090> than<00:03:21.180> everybody<00:03:21.390> else<00:03:21.660> but<00:03:21.930> since

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
different than everybody else but since

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.020 
different than everybody else but since
I<00:03:22.200> didn't<00:03:22.500> want<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.709> take<00:03:22.830> care<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.400> was

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
I didn't want to take care of it I was

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.820 
I didn't want to take care of it I was
always<00:03:24.510> frustrated<00:03:24.780> about<00:03:25.170> how<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> looked

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
always frustrated about how it looked

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.780 
always frustrated about how it looked
and<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.720> was<00:03:27.890> like<00:03:28.890> difficult<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.580> manage

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and it was like difficult to manage

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.460 
and it was like difficult to manage
because<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.420> was<00:03:30.540> trying<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.870> wash<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.410> every

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
because I was trying to wash it every

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.830 
because I was trying to wash it every
day<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.060> part<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.270> being<00:03:33.510> able<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.720> take

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
day and part of not being able to take

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.540 
day and part of not being able to take
care<00:03:34.080> of<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.260> was<00:03:34.530> also<00:03:34.770> due<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.280> fact<00:03:35.489> that

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
care of it was also due to the fact that

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.400 
care of it was also due to the fact that
I<00:03:35.670> tried<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:36.030> treat<00:03:36.420> my<00:03:36.570> hair<00:03:36.750> as<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.200> were

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
I tried to treat my hair as if it were

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.960 
I tried to treat my hair as if it were
straight<00:03:37.770> because<00:03:38.010> that's<00:03:38.190> what<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.370> wanted<00:03:38.700> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
straight because that's what I wanted so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.030 
straight because that's what I wanted so
I<00:03:39.450> would<00:03:39.750> try<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.989> brush<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.470> when<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.680> was<00:03:40.770> dry

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
I would try to brush it when it was dry

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.270 
I would try to brush it when it was dry
or<00:03:41.459> like<00:03:41.840> blow-dry<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.200> like<00:03:43.350> without<00:03:44.130> a

round<00:03:44.550> brush<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:46.200> would<00:03:46.290> not<00:03:46.440> work<00:03:46.620> and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
round brush and it would not work and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.229 
round brush and it would not work and
then<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.010> get<00:03:47.190> frustrated<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.940> it's<00:03:48.060> kind<00:03:48.209> of

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
then I get frustrated so it's kind of

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.600 
then I get frustrated so it's kind of
like<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.420> cycle<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.900> created<00:03:49.220> because<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.250> wanted

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
like a cycle I created because I wanted

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.250 
like a cycle I created because I wanted
to<00:03:50.700> treat<00:03:50.850> here<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.360> tried<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.840> treat<00:03:52.020> my<00:03:52.110> hair

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.540 
to treat here I tried to treat my hair
like<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> straight<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.130> then<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.520> just

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
like in a straight and then that just

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.449 
like in a straight and then that just
made<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.000> like<00:03:54.900> even<00:03:55.170> less<00:03:55.709> appealing<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.370> look

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
made it like even less appealing to look

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.160 
made it like even less appealing to look
at<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:57.000> then<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.150> got<00:03:57.300> more<00:03:57.420> frustrated<00:03:58.080> and

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
at and then I got more frustrated and

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.050 
at and then I got more frustrated and
like<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.950> kind<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.190> thing<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.790> seemed

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
like that kind of thing and I seemed

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.630 
like that kind of thing and I seemed
kind<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.360> dumb<00:04:00.660> but<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.980> me<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.250> was<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
kind of dumb but to me it was the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.390 
kind of dumb but to me it was the
all<00:04:02.819> time<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.990> then<00:04:04.319> another<00:04:04.680> thing<00:04:05.190> which

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
all time and then another thing which

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.130 
all time and then another thing which
kind<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.790> goes<00:04:05.910> into<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.330> how<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.930> looked

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
kind of goes into like how it looked

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.320 
kind of goes into like how it looked
aspect<00:04:07.800> of<00:04:07.980> my<00:04:08.130> hair<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:10.940> like<00:04:11.940> because

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
aspect of my hair is that like because

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.610 
aspect of my hair is that like because
it<00:04:12.420> gets<00:04:12.540> shrinkage<00:04:12.990> when<00:04:13.230> your<00:04:13.380> hair<00:04:13.500> is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
it gets shrinkage when your hair is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.910 
it gets shrinkage when your hair is
curly<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.220> would<00:04:14.850> get<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.829> frustrated<00:04:16.829> by

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
curly I would get really frustrated by

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.380 
curly I would get really frustrated by
that<00:04:16.950> because<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.340> really<00:04:17.549> wanted<00:04:17.790> long<00:04:18.060> hair

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
that because I really wanted long hair

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.099 
that because I really wanted long hair
and<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.660> thought<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.959> looked<00:04:19.070> short<00:04:20.090> being

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
and I thought it looked short being

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.840 
and I thought it looked short being
really<00:04:22.109> like<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:24.060> yeah<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:25.260> then

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
really like that so yeah and then

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.390 
really like that so yeah and then
another<00:04:26.850> slash<00:04:27.890> related<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.070> separate

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
another slash related but separate

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.900 
another slash related but separate
reason<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.270> got<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.570> relaxer<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.820> since<00:04:32.820> I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
reason I got a relaxer is that since I

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.640 
reason I got a relaxer is that since I
already<00:04:33.180> did

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
already did

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.630 
already did

decided I wanted to train hair if I

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.380 
decided I wanted to train hair if I

would take so long that it wasn't like
possible<00:04:42.780> for<00:04:42.930> me<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.020> try<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.290> straighten<00:04:43.560> it

everyday<00:04:44.150> especially<00:04:45.150> sometimes<00:04:45.330> watching

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
everyday especially sometimes watching

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.640 
everyday especially sometimes watching
it<00:04:45.870> every<00:04:45.930> day<00:04:46.400> so<00:04:48.140> because<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.260> all<00:04:49.410> these

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
it every day so because of all these

it every day so because of all these
things<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.310> decided<00:04:50.940> as<00:04:51.210> an<00:04:51.330> 8th<00:04:51.450> grader<00:04:51.690> that

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
things I decided as an 8th grader that

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.010 
things I decided as an 8th grader that
it<00:04:53.370> would<00:04:53.820> be<00:04:53.940> make<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.270> most<00:04:54.360> sense<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.750> get

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
it would be make the most sense to get

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.130 
it would be make the most sense to get
my<00:04:55.140> hair<00:04:55.350> chemically<00:04:55.919> relaxed<00:04:56.780> in<00:04:57.780> order<00:04:58.020> to

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
my hair chemically relaxed in order to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.620 
my hair chemically relaxed in order to
more<00:04:58.260> easily<00:04:58.470> achieve<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.340> everyday<00:05:00.150> straight

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
more easily achieve a everyday straight

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.370 
more easily achieve a everyday straight
hair<00:05:00.840> look<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:02.430> combination<00:05:02.940> of<00:05:03.000> those

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
hair look the combination of those

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.800 
hair look the combination of those
reasons<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.830> thought<00:05:05.550> process<00:05:06.000> is<00:05:06.270> basically

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
reasons and thought process is basically

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.540 
reasons and thought process is basically
why<00:05:07.229> relax<00:05:07.590> been<00:05:07.770> here<00:05:07.890> in<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.070> first<00:05:08.100> place

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
why relax been here in the first place

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.950 
why relax been here in the first place
and<00:05:10.490> after<00:05:11.490> maturing<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.390> little<00:05:12.419> bit<00:05:14.780> most<00:05:15.780> of

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
and after maturing a little bit most of

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.450 
and after maturing a little bit most of
those<00:05:16.020> aren't<00:05:16.260> even<00:05:16.380> effect<00:05:16.740> anymore<00:05:17.160> it's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
those aren't even effect anymore it's

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.070 
those aren't even effect anymore it's
true<00:05:17.760> that<00:05:17.790> I<00:05:18.000> still<00:05:18.300> get<00:05:18.419> frustrated<00:05:18.930> man

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
true that I still get frustrated man

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.950 
true that I still get frustrated man
here<00:05:19.229> at<00:05:19.320> times<00:05:19.590> but<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.850> think<00:05:20.910> anybody<00:05:21.810> gets

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
here at times but I think anybody gets

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.360 
here at times but I think anybody gets
frustrated<00:05:22.410> with<00:05:22.500> their<00:05:22.650> here<00:05:22.740> at<00:05:22.830> times<00:05:23.040> and

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
frustrated with their here at times and

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.420 
frustrated with their here at times and
I<00:05:23.790> also<00:05:24.620> think<00:05:25.620> back<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.979> when<00:05:26.100> I<00:05:26.130> had<00:05:26.280> my

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
I also think back to when I had my

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.040 
I also think back to when I had my
relaxed<00:05:27.030> or<00:05:27.240> when<00:05:27.570> it<00:05:27.660> was<00:05:27.720> straight<00:05:27.930> all<00:05:28.020> the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
relaxed or when it was straight all the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.360 
relaxed or when it was straight all the
time<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.620> realized<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.190> was<00:05:29.340> not

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
time and I realized that that was not

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.140 
time and I realized that that was not
any<00:05:29.700> better<00:05:29.960> for<00:05:30.960> me
