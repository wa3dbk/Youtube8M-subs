00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.330
 emma m 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 with its port 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 and the same for other bodies 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 three times at home 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.740
 but in conflict 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 these 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 the parish of Lorraine Romanesque while block 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.950
 a small school plane center 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 during that time 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 we no longer believe precarious shake the others 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 besides his account that a star of the site 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.370
 there is still some left 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.370
 m welcome 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 just pass for a girl 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.350
 if this victory 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.630
 % 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 why why 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.500
 odd jobs 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.509
 in fact a small committee so it shows how yesterday 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.500
 so we barely exaggerate 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.700
 but in foot us 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.079
 their weight 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.079
 outreau 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 except that you follow me well agree 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.079
 it is not obvious 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.079
 a good thing titus 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 to damage a skin 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.379
 it was not bad because if everyone 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.379
 are stateless 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.299
 we have own resources that are for them 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.789
 five of the six days 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.369
 even though the circus 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.399
 also especially a lot 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:15.619
