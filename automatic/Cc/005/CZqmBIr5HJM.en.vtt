the<00:03:51.859> Super<00:03:52.189> Nintendo<00:03:52.310> version<00:03:53.030> was<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> far

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
the Super Nintendo version was a far

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.159 
the Super Nintendo version was a far
more<00:03:54.500> superior<00:03:54.739> port<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.549> every<00:03:55.879> way<00:03:56.030> even<00:03:56.989> as

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
more superior port in every way even as

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.460 
more superior port in every way even as
a<00:03:57.229> huge<00:03:57.799> Seger<00:03:58.189> fan<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:59.449> even<00:03:59.780> though<00:04:00.019> after

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
a huge Seger fan but even though after

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.409 
a huge Seger fan but even though after
these<00:04:00.590> consoles<00:04:01.129> became<00:04:01.609> end-of-life<00:04:02.209> and

both companies had made new consoles in
their<00:04:04.609> place<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:05.750> seems<00:04:06.019> like<00:04:06.259> Sega<00:04:06.709> were<00:04:06.799> the
