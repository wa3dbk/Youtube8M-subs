00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.680
 hello to all 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.750
 today I want to show you how 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.140
 to color the straws 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.119
 of paper with wood stain 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.800
 mordant for the kingdom is a dye that 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.910
 typically found in paint shops 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.309
 or in the hobby centers that come 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.530
 generally sold in sachets 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.570
 there are of course different brands 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.949
 on the sachets and indicated are indicated 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.660
 doses but we can choose to 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.449
 put more water or less water now 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.609
 we'll see how to do this coloring 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.460
 of course we need straws 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.710
 of paper that can be white 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.949
 made with the burgundy of the newspaper 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:03.409
 or colored with writing etcetera 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.390
 on this type of straws la 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.990
 coloring will have a little effect 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.420
 different because the biting also said 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.030
 impregnating it is in fact impregnating the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.930
 product and not to give a cover 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.899
 so if you think the effect doesn't 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.820
 may be to your liking 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.600
 I recommend using white and straws 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.689
 we also need a white glove 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.549
 disposable ones a small bowl of 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:40.250
 water a roll of absorbent paper from 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:44.469
 cook a brush and see this nylon 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.469
 on which he had to do the coloring 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.369
 take our packet of stain 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.330
 and in the bowl where we would have already put 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.570
 the water 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.149
 let's go and pay it always advice 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.020
 starting with a small amount for later 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.200
 check the color is obtained with the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.330
 brush let's mix is â€‹â€‹a 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.100
 very very thin powder so yes 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.989
 hardly will struggle very very much 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:21.519
 easily and we can already go to 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.140
 see on a straw if the intensity 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.019
 of the color obtained we like this 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.910
 case in my opinion is a little bit clear 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.760
 keep in mind that after the dryer 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.310
 color awaits a little ascoli a 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.799
 darken but I prefer to put a 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.799
 another little bit of color 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.480
 here 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.780
 I believe this will be the color that I am 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.930
 interested i am using a non color 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.239
 we are looking for a light walnut color 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:07.180
 let's see now wait a minute for it 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.609
 dry to see if the shade is 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.879
 what I like then is past 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:19.180
 the drying time the color that 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:24.459
 I wanted and you see that as I said 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.280
 the stain does not cover the color 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.739
 original and newspaper writings but 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.799
 I simply apologize to create 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.500
 nuances about it then now 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.879
 let's proceed to show you in which 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.079
 so I those with the bite 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.590
 I'm just going to get some 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.870
 straws you see I have already put the glove on 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.419
 because the stain tends to stain 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.459
 enough hands then come off yes 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.829
 it's a water based product though 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.940
 however I prefer to use a 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.930
 disposable glove 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.989
 I take my brush and start 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.129
 rolling the straws on themselves a 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.530
 brush very quickly 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.659
 in this way they do not become too impregnated 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:18.780
 of water and therefore are faster in the 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:21.389
 escape tura you see 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.550
 an operation in the end quite 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.080
 fast because the color takes 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.960
 immediately once this is done 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.840
 operation we check that everywhere 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.450
 there is a color but even if it were not 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.389
 the color everywhere, however they are created 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.560
 in my opinion very beautiful nuances 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.050
 that then during the plot they go to give 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.050
 a very very natural effect 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.200
 made this support which straws e 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.200
 I continue with the other straws 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.150
 there are those who prefer to put it directly 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.820
 the straws soaked in the product but a 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.500
 my opinion creates a little bit of waste 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.639
 so I prefer to do it this way 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.639
 these are also ready 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.070
 the straws I use are strong 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.229
 of paper of newspapers the card of 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:33.229
 newspapers in this case absorbs a lot 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.300
 better than other types of cards 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.889
 such as that of flyers then me 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.710
 advice if you intend to color with the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:47.990
 biting to use a type of card 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.729
 quite porous like that of the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.699
 newspapers that allows you to absorb 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.699
 rather quickly the color 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.400
 the breakfast made before certainly has 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:11.319
 great advantages one of which is being able to 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.659
 realize different colors and 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:18.370
 weave with different tanchi 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:21.370
 color is definitely the color of the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.250
 Straws given in this way will render 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.479
 also the natural work when 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.479
 you will weave 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.259
 it is rather fast yes one maybe says but 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:39.650
 with the brush etc. 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:42.020
 I must say I go pretty fast 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:48.560
 see you here in a short time I already have 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:51.259
 made this operation done these 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.590
 straws here that I leaned on the side 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:07:00.500
 see you have not left very wet 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:07.060
 I'm going to put them on a grid where in 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:08.389
 I previously put some paper towels 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.370
 let's say 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:14.120
 here is how I said a grid is used from 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:17.599
 oven above I laid a card 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.090
 kitchen absorbent and here above the 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.860
 my straws in drying certainly 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.979
 now that censors and we can also 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.759
 put it out and in no time at all 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.759
 ready for use 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:36.270
 as you see now 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.730
 outdoors where I put my falls 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.640
 from studying I wanted to say also another 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.010
 what you have seen the quantity of product 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.740
 what I did was really minimal 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.470
 look at how many announcements I could 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.810
 produce with that small amount 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.570
 so I also feel to say that everything 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.400
 added color with the stain can 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.330
 also be a method enough 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.330
 cheap
