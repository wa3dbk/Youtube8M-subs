00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi girls as promised here is remedy 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.589
 fast to repair me expected 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.389
 yesterday before going out with the primula ho 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.910
 banged hard he who blames me 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 split mind being a ghetto closes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 and very long and I didn't want to cut them either 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 remedy this way now vi 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 I show what used one 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 glue me on this but you can 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.130
 very well also use the ss glue 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.890
 of the essence that very good 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.199
 an active growth base already used 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.450
 coast of the dark and then in any 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.880
 nail polish and I used graphic art 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.890
 I always eat the cup now 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
 see procedure 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 I open respectable I accept so as to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 to be able to spread the glue both inside and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
 out July helping me with 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.969
 the applicator to brush this 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.370
 the long procedure is appropriate 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 broken in a symmetrical way that is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.530
 broken nail studies coincide 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 perfectly theoretically to do 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 last this repair longer 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.109
 we should shorten them a little 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.059
 nails for this I refer you to the video 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.100
 done previously where I explain another 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 remedy I put the link at the top a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 left being that I didn't want to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.270
 shorten or only repaired there a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.270
 this point after applying the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.150
 I join the two parts of the mega and the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.150
 I match up to collapsed 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.210
 after having dried the glue well 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.050
 I apply a draft of active nail polish 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.050
 pupa growth 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.730
 in this photo you can see the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.430
 result after drying the 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.760
 base apply smart cost in holographic 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.940
 rosÃ© as always giving the first 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.550
 drafting to define the cuticle round e 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.600
 then a second draft to define 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.600
 good color 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.320
 in this photo you can see that it 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.130
 enamel despite repair not 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.800
 presents some swelling from furrows 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.650
 finally I apply the top coat I use and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.320
 delivers the essence of the gel that do love 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.110
 always two drafts the first draft for 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.060
 seal just dry after the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.470
 second draft to give the gel effect 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.910
 in the picture you can see the final result 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.010
 girls this is what I do 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.450
