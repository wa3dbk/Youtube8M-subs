dashing<00:01:44.490> Cody<00:01:45.030> Rhodes<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.810> Cody<00:01:46.110> Rhodes<00:01:46.409> or

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
dashing Cody Rhodes or as Cody Rhodes or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
dashing Cody Rhodes or as Cody Rhodes or
as<00:01:47.189> any<00:01:47.670> other<00:01:47.790> gimmicks<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.750> he's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
as any other gimmicks that he's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.859 
as any other gimmicks that he's
portrayed<00:01:49.979> along<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.689> always

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
portrayed along the way I have always

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
portrayed along the way I have always
thought<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.439> Cody<00:01:52.710> could<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.280> doing<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.759> little

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
thought the Cody could be doing a little

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
thought the Cody could be doing a little
bit<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.659> make<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> serious

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
bit more to make it more of a serious

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.889 
bit more to make it more of a serious
wrestler<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:56.969> hold<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.750> did

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
wrestler when they hold when they did

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
wrestler when they hold when they did
the<00:01:58.020> whole<00:01:58.170> gimmick<00:01:58.490> basically<00:01:59.490> where<00:01:59.640> Cody

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the whole gimmick basically where Cody

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.580 
the whole gimmick basically where Cody
was<00:02:00.119> fired<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.079> had<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> bring

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
was fired and then they had to bring

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
was fired and then they had to bring
Goldust<00:02:02.159> back<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.610> order<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.360> match

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
Goldust back in order to have the match

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
Goldust back in order to have the match

against the shield normally get Cody's
job<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.479> thought<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> be

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
job back I thought that was going to be

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
job back I thought that was going to be
more<00:02:07.770> than<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.910> Rhodes<00:02:09.179> brothers<00:02:09.360> being

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
more than just the Rhodes brothers being

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.479 
more than just the Rhodes brothers being
double<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.349> champions<00:02:10.950> leading<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
double to be champions leading to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.720 
double to be champions leading to
Stardust<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> go

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
Stardust and go

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.780 
Stardust and go
just<00:02:12.989> being<00:02:13.989> tag-team<00:02:14.500> champions<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.580> and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
just being tag-team champions and and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.940 
just being tag-team champions and and
then<00:02:15.909> losing<00:02:16.330> titles<00:02:16.720> than<00:02:16.870> breaking<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
then losing titles than breaking up and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.589 
then losing titles than breaking up and
having<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.640> match<00:02:18.879> at<00:02:20.970> Fastlane<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.209> thought

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
having a match at Fastlane I thought

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.850 
having a match at Fastlane I thought
there<00:02:22.750> was<00:02:22.840> gonna<00:02:22.930> be<00:02:23.049> more<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.560> whole

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
there was gonna be more to that whole

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.199 
there was gonna be more to that whole
storyline<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.370> thought<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.849> was<00:02:24.970> they<00:02:25.120> need

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
storyline I thought that was they need

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.580 
storyline I thought that was they need
to<00:02:25.269> be<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> progression<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.110> Cody<00:02:26.349> Rhodes

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
to be the progression of Cody Rhodes

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.050 
to be the progression of Cody Rhodes
making<00:02:27.489> him<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.730> more<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.299> know<00:02:29.040> usable

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
making him a more you know usable

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
making him a more you know usable
wrestler<00:02:31.060> or<00:02:31.690> basically<00:02:32.080> he'd<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.530> moving<00:02:32.890> up

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
wrestler or basically he'd be moving up

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.259 
wrestler or basically he'd be moving up
into<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.370> card<00:02:33.610> moving<00:02:34.030> into<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
into the card moving into that

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.780 
into the card moving into that
championship<00:02:35.049> run<00:02:35.340> definitely<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> think<00:02:36.489> if

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
championship run definitely I think if

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.520 
championship run definitely I think if
the<00:02:36.940> World<00:02:37.150> Heavyweight<00:02:37.299> Championship<00:02:38.080> belt

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the World Heavyweight Championship belt

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.080 
the World Heavyweight Championship belt
was<00:02:38.799> still<00:02:38.980> around<00:02:39.099> i<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.670> Cody<00:02:39.879> Rhodes

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
was still around i think the Cody Rhodes

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.330 
was still around i think the Cody Rhodes
would<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.200> competition<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:42.040> be<00:02:42.129> holding

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
would be in a competition to be holding

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.920 
would be in a competition to be holding
that<00:02:42.579> title<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.150> since<00:02:43.329> now<00:02:43.510> there<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.810> only

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
that title but since now there is only

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.350 
that title but since now there is only
one<00:02:44.260> championship<00:02:44.829> Emma's<00:02:45.760> able<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.150> these

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
one championship Emma's able to be these

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.300 
one championship Emma's able to be these
days<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.379> waist<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.069> Seth

is a chance that John Cena might lose
even<00:03:39.519> though<00:03:39.760> he's<00:03:39.970> already<00:03:40.209> defending<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
even though he's already defending the

think<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:43.959> about<00:03:44.230> two<00:03:44.470> weeks<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.980> might

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
think it's it's about two weeks it might

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.860 
think it's it's about two weeks it might
be<00:03:45.280> three<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.730> i'm<00:03:46.060> pretty<00:03:46.269> sure<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.660> too<00:03:46.840> i

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
