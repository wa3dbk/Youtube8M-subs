00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
added a little bit of salt and so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
added a little bit of salt and so
controvert<00:01:24.479> actually<00:01:24.840> has<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> large

as that's happening I'm going to drizzle
in<00:01:43.950> half<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.030> cup<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.509> extra<00:01:46.079> virgin<00:01:46.110> olive<00:01:46.740> oil

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
in half a cup of extra virgin olive oil

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
in half a cup of extra virgin olive oil
and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.479> seems<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.930> lot<00:01:49.049> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and I know this seems like a lot this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.490 
and I know this seems like a lot this
recipe<00:01:50.040> actually<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.939> cup<00:01:51.270> total<00:01:51.810> but

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
recipe actually has one cup total but

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
recipe actually has one cup total but
again<00:01:52.860> focaccia<00:01:53.520> bread<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.060> reason<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
again focaccia bread the reason it's so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.060 
again focaccia bread the reason it's so
dang<00:01:55.829> good<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.850> rich<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> tasty<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.200> because

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
dang good so rich and tasty is because

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
dang good so rich and tasty is because
there's<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.700> much<00:01:59.820> olive<00:02:00.210> oil<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
there's so much olive oil in it and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
there's so much olive oil in it and
that's<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.530> gives<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.070> chewy<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that's what gives it that chewy kind of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
that's what gives it that chewy kind of
almost<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.469> pizza<00:02:05.460> dough<00:02:05.610> quality<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
almost like pizza dough quality that it

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.830 
almost like pizza dough quality that it
has<00:02:07.350> when<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> bite<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> my<00:02:09.660> dough<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
has when you bite into it so my dough is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.559 
has when you bite into it so my dough is
come<00:02:10.170> together<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.619> let<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> need

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
come together I let it need

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.390 
come together I let it need
for<00:02:11.719> about<00:02:11.840> five<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.349> six<00:02:12.530> minutes<00:02:12.829> on<00:02:13.159> medium

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
for about five to six minutes on medium

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.629 
for about five to six minutes on medium
speed<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.659> you<00:02:14.840> can<00:02:15.019> see<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.950> not<00:02:16.159> super

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:16.639 
speed and as you can see it's not super

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.759 
speed and as you can see it's not super
sticky<00:02:16.969> but<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.689> does<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.409> little<00:02:18.560> bit<00:02:18.739> of

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
sticky but it does have a little bit of

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.459 
sticky but it does have a little bit of
a<00:02:19.180> tackiness<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.659> and<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.049> sticking<00:02:21.409> to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
a tackiness to it and it is sticking to

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.410 
a tackiness to it and it is sticking to
my<00:02:21.650> hands<00:02:21.859> a<00:02:21.980> little<00:02:22.069> bit<00:02:22.249> and<00:02:22.519> that's<00:02:23.030> okay

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
my hands a little bit and that's okay

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.569 
my hands a little bit and that's okay
because<00:02:23.629> we<00:02:23.989> don't<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.499> to<00:02:24.560> keep<00:02:24.829> adding<00:02:25.280> too

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
because we don't want to keep adding too

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.839 
because we don't want to keep adding too
much<00:02:25.819> flour<00:02:26.209> otherwise<00:02:26.900> you'll<00:02:27.109> have<00:02:27.139> dense

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
much flour otherwise you'll have dense

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.429 
much flour otherwise you'll have dense
focaccia<00:02:28.849> bread<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.389> no<00:02:29.629> one<00:02:29.840> wants<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.349> we

stretch out the focaccia dough over this
oil<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.349> that's<00:02:57.530> what's<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.949> to<00:02:58.189> kind<00:02:59.120> of

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
little bit of a crust on the bottom so

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.550 
little bit of a crust on the bottom so
the<00:03:04.969> bread<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.510> dough<00:03:05.689> is<00:03:05.900> actually<00:03:06.230> really

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the bread the dough is actually really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.470 
the bread the dough is actually really
easy<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.949> work<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.489> I'm<00:03:07.730> just<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.180> use

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
easy to work with I'm just going to use

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.809 
easy to work with I'm just going to use
my<00:03:08.689> hands<00:03:09.139> to<00:03:09.169> kind<00:03:09.439> of<00:03:09.560> pool<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:09.859> shape<00:03:10.519> and

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
my hands to kind of pool and shape and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.390 
my hands to kind of pool and shape and
stretch<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.419> coax<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.019> dough<00:03:12.199> to<00:03:12.949> basically

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
stretch and coax the dough to basically

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.610 
stretch and coax the dough to basically
fit<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.969> entire<00:03:14.359> pan<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:14.989> can't<00:03:15.379> give<00:03:15.530> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
fit this entire pan if you can't give it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.619 
fit this entire pan if you can't give it
to<00:03:15.739> stretch<00:03:16.009> out<00:03:16.250> completely<00:03:16.939> to<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.299> edges

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
to stretch out completely to the edges

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.089 
to stretch out completely to the edges
that's<00:03:17.810> totally<00:03:18.530> fine

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
that's totally fine

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.159 
that's totally fine
after<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.090> stretched<00:03:20.509> out<00:03:20.689> the<00:03:20.810> dough<00:03:20.989> I'm

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
after I stretched out the dough I'm

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.080 
after I stretched out the dough I'm
going<00:03:21.439> to<00:03:21.560> cover<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:22.040> with<00:03:22.159> plastic<00:03:22.340> wrap<00:03:22.729> and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
going to cover it with plastic wrap and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.530 
going to cover it with plastic wrap and
let<00:03:23.479> it<00:03:23.659> rise<00:03:24.229> again<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:25.400> another<00:03:25.849> about<00:03:26.269> an

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
let it rise again for another about an

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.499 
let it rise again for another about an
hour<00:03:26.659> maybe<00:03:27.109> less<00:03:27.409> time<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.609> actually<00:03:28.879> am

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:29.509 
hour maybe less time and I actually am

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.119 
hour maybe less time and I actually am
making<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.139> dough<00:03:30.379> in<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.709> middle<00:03:31.040> of

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
making this dough in the middle of

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.490 
making this dough in the middle of
