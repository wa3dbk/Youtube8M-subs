00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.249 
looks like a bug crawled up Gus's plot
and<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.799> took<00:01:47.399> their<00:01:47.640> photo

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
this photo was actually taken back in
2004<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.799> probably<00:01:58.979> won't<00:01:59.310> make<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
2004 so they probably won't make that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.990 
2004 so they probably won't make that
mistake<00:01:59.790> again

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
mistake again

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.670

let's<00:02:02.000> see<00:02:02.450> how<00:02:02.600> close<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.899> can<00:02:03.170> get<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.409> them

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
let's see how close we can get to them

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.450 
let's see how close we can get to them
