 work with a record cut if not in the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.840
 end of it but was mounted several 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.939
 stars within the record cut is still 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.990
 considered simple only, not even if you 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 have to pay a little more attention 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.849

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.380
 right then and here is how 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.090
 You can see us going to work. 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.020

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:48.940
 ok in the paper of 60 by 50 we cut cut 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.839
 history afterwards in the end was a bit 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.089
 smaller 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.749
 Ok, we 'll do it and go. 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.379

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.930
 You'll do what you're going to do. 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.090
 here on the side here we will work 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.550
 with a band of 7 centimeters was marked 7 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.430
 777 until the end of the sheet is the other 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.130
 side wants to do the same thing goes 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.710
 I work from 77 because I want you to 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.980
 put the rule here right for you 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.910
 power to cut your band will stay 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.150
 certinha 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.000
 ok then this is the first part card 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.260
 done that you cut the center of katia 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.160
 do we will work with leather 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.650
 inverted 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.310
 so you will leave the first one is right 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.940
 and will exchange the second will leave until 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.880
 sena and will exchange 4 that will leave 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.100
 Thursday she traded so she'll stay 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.950

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.440
 blue orange blue orange right in downtown 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.240
 unlike blue orange blue to 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.920
 Jesus 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:06.659
 blue ok size a necklace for us 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 begin to assemble our sheet made 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.050
 collage problem particular the zone of the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.959
 orange angels on the bottom upside down is 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.459
 to ravage the Guarani and so will 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.230
 So I guess at this time when 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.239
 and you are seeing is what we will 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.790
 do not use ruler 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.980
 now we're going to score in the horizontal 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.819
 already the same size that will work 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:35.280
 shirt 17 from the total of 777 until the end in 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:42.000
 up okay and 7 until the end 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.019
 marking image made ok now have a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.840
 order 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.030
 It's for people with cut so you think 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.489
 in action among all the right markings 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.000
 then that here always the first to 1st 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.799
 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and know and male the same 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.390
 thing counts at the tip 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.200
 So you're going to start chopping on the street. 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.090
 just do not agree a first is the first 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.190
 what's up with the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th here 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.560
 low then here you go 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:16.859
 cut the first one with the fourth here 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.750
 right the angle will be right and then 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.180
 you will affect all go there 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.220
 sure hit in the first to fourth 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.650
 second to the fifth with the third 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.329
 science as soon as you finish cutting 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.870
 Here the sides also makes the measurement 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.730
 Here're the same band size 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:39.540
 understand and like every year goes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:43.380
 to cut the entire sheet is ending 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.370
 cut off the power are all already cut off 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.590
 We 'll do what, who will? 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.450
 work with the right color inversion 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.739
 again we will revert all 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.730
 leaves it will give the feeling of 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.799
 checkered 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.440
 first we leave on Monday the 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.139
 people change the third we leave 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 Wednesday we exchange and so on until the end 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.410
 so you will do all this and will 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.410
 paste it all over again 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.410
 It's really up to you to connect the tracks 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.010
 the glued sheet will look this way 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.710
 all checkered so we cut 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.110
 From here to here without water we will cut 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.810
 the opposite from here to there will have the same 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.970
 thing to be up there on the first 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.590
 sure to be here the first second 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.850
 third and fourth is only to cut the first 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.470
 with room 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.630
 you can put the whole 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.550
 marking with support of seven in seven 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.600
 but you do not need to because every gang 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.980
 who already has seven will get the first in 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.960
 conquest from 1st 2nd 3rd 4th right and there 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.420
 You'll cut it all down again. 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.810
 It's over there, we'll reverse the 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.810
 Colors 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.920
 so right here already played tracks are 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.900
 that I did here I left the first one 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.850
 inverted from the bottom with the bottom sheet 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.010
 and leave the third 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.750
 I changed the fourth I left here yet 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.510
 I changed the Friday 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.350
 I let the tropical party was leaving 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.850
 to change the tenth and leave this first 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.460
 size you win everything and now it's just 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.200
 necklace cup is already there, you can see the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.169
 drawings of the stars is now just 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:23.070
 paste the leaves are there 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:27.990
 the papers bonded better when the effect 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.560
 of the right stars all collections have 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.560
 stars 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.570
 that's it 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.120
 now practice developing the right 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.000
 trick here is you always you that you 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.250
 use a light color a dark color 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.610
 magazines're causing force 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.210
 combinations of vehicular raja is that these 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.980
 things were 1 blue with blue then it makes 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.600
 a lighter color a darker color and 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.520
 you will have a nice result these 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.330
 elections here enough 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.009
 widely used 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.319
 God is not the brass in the potatoes but 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.580
 put in bridge bushes that also stay 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:10.080
 Nice to the important thing is the art 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.789
 certain is that business that people 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.620
 worked here with a band of 7 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.469
 centimeter is if you work with 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.449
 range of 10 will have another effect 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.280
 if you work with range 5 will have 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.710
 another totally different effect says 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.949
 Here're influencers systems only 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.409
 will have more stars right then beauty 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.389
 That 's it , folks. That's it. Soon the network. 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.210
 promotes another video but for now 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:36.139
 This is good training and good winds for everything. 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.139
 world was good
