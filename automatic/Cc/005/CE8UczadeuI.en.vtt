evolve<00:01:47.759> his<00:01:48.030> career<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.630> he<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.720> simply

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
got in a comfort zone and that can be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
got in a comfort zone and that can be

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
what's you know we're looking at what is

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.409 
what's you know we're looking at what is
the<00:04:16.380> story<00:04:16.650> line<00:04:16.919> when<00:04:17.160> we<00:04:17.280> set<00:04:17.489> guys<00:04:17.669> up<00:04:17.910> first

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
the story line when we set guys up first

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.969 
the story line when we set guys up first
of<00:04:18.570> all<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:19.049> fight<00:04:19.380> will<00:04:19.560> be<00:04:19.709> fascinating

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
of all this fight will be fascinating

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.790 
of all this fight will be fascinating
because<00:04:20.459> ver<00:04:21.060> doom<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.470> theoretically<00:04:22.470> a

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
because ver doom is theoretically a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.279 
because ver doom is theoretically a
better<00:04:23.310> ground<00:04:23.970> fighter<00:04:24.419> than<00:04:24.750> Nogueira<00:04:25.140> and

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
better ground fighter than Nogueira and

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.840 
better ground fighter than Nogueira and
you<00:04:25.349> can't<00:04:25.590> say<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.919> about<00:04:26.039> very<00:04:26.370> many

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
you can't say that about very many

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.550 
you can't say that about very many
so<00:04:27.030> that's<00:04:27.240> interesting<00:04:27.600> but<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.230> set<00:04:28.440> up

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
so that's interesting but you set up

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.500 
so that's interesting but you set up
this<00:04:28.680> scenario<00:04:29.400> where<00:04:29.610> Nogueira<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.240> fights

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
this scenario where Nogueira in fights

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.180 
this scenario where Nogueira in fights
he's<00:04:30.720> supposed<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.050> lose<00:04:31.320> sometimes<00:04:32.130> just

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
he's supposed to lose sometimes just

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.400 
he's supposed to lose sometimes just
excites<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:33.030> crowd<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.390> Brazil<00:04:33.900> he's<00:04:34.170> better

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
excites a crowd in Brazil he's better

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.500 
excites a crowd in Brazil he's better
than<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.770> than<00:04:35.040> anywhere<00:04:35.460> this<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.240> great

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510
