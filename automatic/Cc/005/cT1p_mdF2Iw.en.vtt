00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
gauges can all move synchronized so I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
gauges can all move synchronized so I
guess<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> show<00:01:34.350> they're<00:01:34.560> aligned<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.250> held

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
guess to show they're aligned I held

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
guess to show they're aligned I held
this<00:01:35.880> down<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.420> than<00:01:36.570> 10<00:01:36.750> seconds<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
this down for more than 10 seconds I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.510 
this down for more than 10 seconds I
thought<00:01:37.439> maybe<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.220> another

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
thought maybe it would go into another

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240 
thought maybe it would go into another
mode<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> doesn't<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.799> shows<00:01:41.040> over

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
mode but it doesn't and it shows over

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.550 
mode but it doesn't and it shows over
there<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> everything<00:01:42.060> works<00:01:42.210> properly<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.200 

see<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.799> does<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.640> goes<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
see what that does when that goes up it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
see what that does when that goes up it
just<00:01:48.390> makes<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> gas<00:01:48.899> light<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.399> every
