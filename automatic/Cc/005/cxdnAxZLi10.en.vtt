00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 unfortunately modern indie projects 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.150
 become like one to another 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.130
 take pinch pixel graphics 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.500
 crafting a simple story to taste 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.740
 bake it all in a kitchen compiler and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 voila masterpiece greenlight and ready 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.410
 Today's game is probably only 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.150
 pixel graphics 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.650
 but can you say that it hurts 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.650
 let's find out the project 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.310
 damn well of course not the same isaac or 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.890
 Isak someone like more 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 the original game was written in flash 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 and released in 2011 it was sold 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 over 2 million copies agree for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 games of this level are very 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.270
 not bad but as the magician said he is not the chief 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 game producer many aspects just 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.289
 impossible to implement on flash and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.629
 therefore it was decided 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.340
 rework the game on a full engine 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.980
 in fact the screen is not typical 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 representatives of the action rpg action genre 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 the game takes place in the basement in which 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 little sak escapes fleeing from his 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 mother religious woman at one time 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.750
 heard a voice from above 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 who told her to kill her son so 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 how is he a product of evil 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.450
 starting the game we fall by chance 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.430
 generated level divided by 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 several rooms where to go to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.650
 the next one is to kill the boss main 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.229
 weapons tears can be improved in every way 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.670
 drop down from bosses things or find 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.890
 upgrades in special places 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.080
 besides improvement we can get 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.479
 unique satellites or special 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.189
 opportunities to play we have to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.650
 several characters but at first 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.720
 only isak is available the rest 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.759
 open with the passing of the game or 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 after certain conditions are met 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.409
 what has changed the recycled game 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 the main difference is of course the engine 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.280
 the game was transformed both in graphic so 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.409
 and gameplay 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.750
 leather standard room sizes 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.180
 added and huge actions in which 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 did not fit the screen in the game were 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 Added new chips 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.850
 for example a room with a bed having slept on 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.189
 you can completely restore your 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 health is not spared and enemies 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.909
 besides the original monsters 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.629
 can see brand new 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.800
 representatives let's consider the pros 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.440
 definitely one of the features of the game 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.350
 it is her replayability that is possible 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.330
 sense pass and again and again here it is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.520
 works first with chellendzhi 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.590
 discover new characters or receive 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.530
 achievements and of course thanks 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
 features generate allocations each 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.700
 once getting items and combining them in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.320
 sometimes very specific build we 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.440
 we reach an interesting way 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.540
 annihilating enemies with music is also all in 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.090
 alright she doesn't distract and maintain 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.340
 the dynamics of the game for all time desire 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.890
 I personally didnâ€™t turn it off 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.360
 Of the minuses I can note this sometimes 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.400
 very unsuccessful race 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.710
 in which you do not come across a single 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.560
 useful upgrade but here as soon as 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.580
 lucky co-op 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.360
 only available on one machine 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.770
 visited you play will fail and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.170
 the original graphics on my subjective 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.570
 look looks much nicer 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 although it is not quite a minus since we 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.720
 promised to release a filter later 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.970
 approximating the picture to the original so 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.980
 we got in the end it's all the same 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.489
 alfik rather modernized 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.780
 option with its advantages and disadvantages 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.760
 everyone who liked the original 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.680
 I highly recommend to get acquainted with 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.959
 his new version I advise everyone else to 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.940
 at least try to pass a couple 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.959
 evenings in anticipation of the imminent blockbusters 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 exactly get 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.210
 thanks for watching you was games so 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.210
 beware of the basements
