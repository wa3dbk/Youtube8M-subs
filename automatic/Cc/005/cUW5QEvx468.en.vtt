did they also make 10 kg tag team for

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.700 
did they also make 10 kg tag team for
the<00:01:42.930> PSP<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:44.960> really<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.170> hard<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.470> me<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the PSP and I really it's hard for me to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.440 
the PSP and I really it's hard for me to
think<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.130> should<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
think of I should actually think that I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
think of I should actually think that I
could<00:01:48.570> trust<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.649> another<00:01:50.009> game<00:01:50.310> like

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
could trust them with another game like

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.060 
could trust them with another game like
let's<00:01:50.670> say<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.049> budokai<00:01:52.530> Tenkaichi

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
let's say there was a budokai Tenkaichi

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.170 
let's say there was a budokai Tenkaichi
or<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:54.200> raging<00:01:55.200> blast<00:01:55.380> 3<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.310> works<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
or a raging blast 3 in the works if it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.690 
or a raging blast 3 in the works if it
was<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.200> doubt<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
was which I doubt that it is but if it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.899 
was which I doubt that it is but if it
was<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.469> completely<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.430> hundred

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
was when you really completely a hundred

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.899 
was when you really completely a hundred
percent<00:02:03.060> trust<00:02:03.689> spiked<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.040> nah<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
percent trust spiked with that nah I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.540 
percent trust spiked with that nah I
don't<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:08.250> choice

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
don't know really about my choice

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.809 
don't know really about my choice
because<00:02:08.849> honestly<00:02:09.629> they<00:02:09.899> seem<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> really

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
because honestly they seem to really

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
because honestly they seem to really
somewhat<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:12.060> down<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.780> people<00:02:13.050> thought

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
somewhat have down what people thought

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.580 
somewhat have down what people thought
they

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
they

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.470 
they
may<00:02:13.680> want<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.099> alternate<00:02:14.400> n<00:02:14.489> ket<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.330> they

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
may want in alternate n ket but they

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
may want in alternate n ket but they
messed<00:02:15.750> up<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.080> entirety<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.680> gameplay

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
messed up the entirety of the gameplay

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.380 
messed up the entirety of the gameplay
it's<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.489> they<00:02:17.879> had<00:02:18.090> pretty<00:02:18.330> much

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the first dragon ball z game to have

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.470 
the first dragon ball z game to have
character<00:02:39.330> creation<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.849> then<00:02:41.849> they<00:02:42.060> mess<00:02:42.330> up

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480

because<00:02:44.459> ultimate<00:02:45.120> Tenkaichi<00:02:45.540> itself<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.019> a

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
because ultimate Tenkaichi itself is a

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.190 
because ultimate Tenkaichi itself is a
beautiful<00:02:47.040> game<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.670> good<00:02:48.540> looking<00:02:48.930> but

beautiful game it's so good looking but

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.670 
beautiful game it's so good looking but
the<00:02:49.890> gameplay<00:02:50.099> itself<00:02:50.370> ruin<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.680> then

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the gameplay itself ruin it and then

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.770 
the gameplay itself ruin it and then

die which I don't even understand why

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.600 
die which I don't even understand why
they<00:03:06.959> would<00:03:06.989> ever<00:03:07.319> think<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.010> making<00:03:08.430> a

they would ever think that making a

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
work at all ever but if even if that was

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.490 
work at all ever but if even if that was
the<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.370> was<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.549> truth<00:03:15.000> why<00:03:15.569> would<00:03:16.200> these

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the that was the truth why would these

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.009 
the that was the truth why would these
are<00:03:16.709> connected<00:03:17.129> for<00:03:17.760> 1b<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.780> no

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
content has barely any content and it is

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.860 
content has barely any content and it is
just<00:03:23.040> such<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.220> poorly<00:03:23.730> executed<00:03:24.030> game<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870

they're gonna be trying to like like if
the<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.169> doubt<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:16.739> would<00:04:16.829> ever<00:04:17.010> continue

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
the I doubt they would ever continue

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.449 
the I doubt they would ever continue
budokai<00:04:18.000> Tenkaichi<00:04:18.510> now<00:04:19.010> because<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.220> old

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
budokai Tenkaichi now because it's old

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.979 
budokai Tenkaichi now because it's old
and<00:04:20.700> there's<00:04:21.060> no<00:04:21.209> point<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.870> would<00:04:21.959> just

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
and there's no point that would just

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.080 
and there's no point that would just
make<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.229> new<00:04:22.380> series<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.610> if<00:04:23.729> they<00:04:23.849> were<00:04:23.909> ever

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
make a new series but if they were ever

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.250 
make a new series but if they were ever
going<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.330> make<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.479> raging<00:04:24.750> blast<00:04:24.870> 3<00:04:25.110> which

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
going to make a raging blast 3 which

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.170 
going to make a raging blast 3 which
also<00:04:25.409> i<00:04:25.530> doubt<00:04:25.800> but<00:04:26.039> if<00:04:26.190> they<00:04:26.310> were

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
also i doubt but if they were

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.760 
also i doubt but if they were
I<00:04:27.210> don't<00:04:27.419> know<00:04:27.509> if<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.660> could<00:04:27.720> trust<00:04:27.810> them<00:04:28.199> it's

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770

kind<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:29.460> hard<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:29.880> trust<00:04:30.120> them<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
kind of really hard to trust them and

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.590 
kind of really hard to trust them and

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
of a little bit on the empty side but

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.240 
of a little bit on the empty side but
then<00:05:40.080> budokai<00:05:40.409> Tenkaichi<00:05:40.740> two<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.099> three

then budokai Tenkaichi two and three

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.520 
then budokai Tenkaichi two and three
were<00:05:41.280> really<00:05:41.610> good<00:05:41.760> games<00:05:42.080> Regin<00:05:43.080> was<00:05:43.169> one<00:05:43.380> and

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
were really good games Regin was one and

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
two were kind of water down but they

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.490 
two were kind of water down but they
were<00:05:44.729> still<00:05:44.789> good<00:05:45.479> games<00:05:45.780> in<00:05:45.960> their<00:05:46.139> own<00:05:46.260> right

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.149 
were still good games in their own right
and<00:05:46.740> then<00:05:46.979> they<00:05:47.550> have<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:47.789> that<00:05:48.060> they<00:05:48.210> had<00:05:49.159> done

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
and then they have to that they had done

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.710 
and then they have to that they had done
k<00:05:50.310> battle<00:05:50.610> royale<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.090> then<00:05:51.210> they<00:05:51.300> had<00:05:51.419> oldham

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
k battle royale and then they had oldham

k battle royale and then they had oldham
Tenkaichi<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.560> connect<00:05:53.340> so<00:05:54.139> it's<00:05:55.139> hard<00:05:55.229> for

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
Tenkaichi and connect so it's hard for

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.439 
Tenkaichi and connect so it's hard for
me<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.650> say<00:05:55.860> whether<00:05:56.370> i<00:05:56.490> think<00:05:56.909> spike<00:05:57.150> could

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
me to say whether i think spike could

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.149 
me to say whether i think spike could
ever<00:05:57.659> make<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:57.930> good<00:05:58.169> DBZ<00:05:58.530> game<00:05:58.650> ever<00:05:58.889> again

ever make a good DBZ game ever again
honestly<00:05:59.820> I<00:06:00.030> think<00:06:00.180> that<00:06:00.449> if<00:06:00.570> they<00:06:00.659> were<00:06:00.750> given

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
honestly I think that if they were given

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.120 
honestly I think that if they were given
the<00:06:01.080> chance<00:06:01.259> though<00:06:01.500> I<00:06:01.530> think<00:06:01.650> they<00:06:01.860> may<00:06:02.070> be

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
the chance though I think they may be

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.279 
the chance though I think they may be
able<00:06:02.340> to<00:06:02.460> pull<00:06:02.699> an<00:06:03.000> okay<00:06:03.419> one<00:06:03.630> out<00:06:03.810> but<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.110> don't
