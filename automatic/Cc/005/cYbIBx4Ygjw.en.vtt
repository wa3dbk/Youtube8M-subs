now<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:09.690> technique<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.260> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> talk

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
now the first technique I want to talk

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.369 
now the first technique I want to talk
about<00:00:14.209> messages<00:00:15.209> has<00:00:15.600> to<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.260> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
about messages has to do with what you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.870 
about messages has to do with what you
want<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.650> do<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.039> very<00:00:17.280> beginning<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
want to do and it's very beginning of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.200 
want to do and it's very beginning of
the<00:00:17.940> writing<00:00:18.120> process<00:00:18.450> if<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:20.060> going<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the writing process if you are going to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.960 
the writing process if you are going to
write<00:00:21.600> something<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.170> ambitious<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:23.820> want

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
write something this ambitious you want

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.690 
write something this ambitious you want
to<00:00:24.060> ask<00:00:24.210> yourself<00:00:24.360> two<00:00:24.930> key<00:00:25.200> questions<00:00:25.700> first

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
to ask yourself two key questions first

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.400 
to ask yourself two key questions first
of<00:00:26.880> all<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.780> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.260> specific<00:00:29.100> system<00:00:30.410> that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of all what is the specific system that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.090 
of all what is the specific system that
you<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.860> to<00:00:32.009> express<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.730> story

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
you are going to express in this story

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.680 
you are going to express in this story
for<00:00:35.100> example<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> Godfather

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
for example in the Godfather

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.259 
for example in the Godfather
it's<00:00:37.019> the<00:00:37.379> Mafia<00:00:37.890> system<00:00:38.570> that's<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.170> system

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
it's the Mafia system that's the system

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's the Mafia system that's the system
sitting<00:00:42.269> under<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> surface<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.429> are

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
sitting under the surface that they are

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.220 
sitting under the surface that they are
all<00:00:44.850> caught<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.600> some<00:00:45.839> way<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> what's<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
all caught in in some way so what's the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.079 
all caught in in some way so what's the
system<00:00:49.769> you're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.249> express<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
system you're going to express and the

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.779 
system you're going to express and the
second<00:00:51.510> question<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.370> who<00:00:53.370> will<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.609> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
second question is who will be the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.069 
second question is who will be the
characters<00:00:55.879> will<00:00:56.879> express<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> different

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
characters will express the different

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.810 
characters will express the different
rules<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.190> system

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.300 

it<00:01:04.269> will<00:01:04.480> be<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> characters<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.650> express<00:01:06.040> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
it will be the characters to express the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.300 
it will be the characters to express the
different<00:01:06.700> rules<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.870> system<00:01:08.290> now<00:01:09.070> this

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
different rules of the system now this

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.750 
different rules of the system now this
comes<00:01:10.440> second<00:01:11.440> question<00:01:11.770> comes<00:01:11.920> from<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.220> very

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
comes second question comes from a very

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.620 
comes second question comes from a very
important<00:01:13.390> point<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.610> your<00:01:16.240> hero

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
important point which is your hero

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.070 
important point which is your hero
cannot<00:01:17.350> fight<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.790> system<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.570> lot<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.869> times

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
cannot fight the system a lot of times

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.870 
cannot fight the system a lot of times
I'll<00:01:20.320> say<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.650> writer<00:01:20.890> who's<00:01:21.250> your<00:01:21.430> opponent

I'll say the writer who's your opponent

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.120 
I'll say the writer who's your opponent
is<00:01:22.000> about<00:01:22.119> my<00:01:22.360> heroes<00:01:23.020> fighting<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.440> system<00:01:23.680> I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
is about my heroes fighting the system I

say oh really where's that they're just
fighting<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.240> system<00:01:28.720> you're<00:01:29.200> shadowboxing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
fighting the system you're shadowboxing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.260 
fighting the system you're shadowboxing
there's<00:01:31.600> nothing<00:01:32.020> there<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.729> what<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.030> have

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
to do is you have to come up with

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.320 
to do is you have to come up with
characters<00:01:38.320> who<00:01:38.770> will<00:01:38.890> express<00:01:39.430> some<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.270> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
characters who will express some of the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.080 
characters who will express some of the
different<00:01:40.690> aspects<00:01:41.550> some<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.729> different

different aspects some of the different
pillars<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.170> system

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.440 

technique<00:01:50.999> number<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.359> is<00:01:52.319> that<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.609> need<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
technique number two is that you need a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.980 
technique number two is that you need a
minimum<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.350> four<00:01:55.950> characters<00:01:56.429> four<00:01:57.390> major

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
minimum of four characters four major

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
characters to do this story right it's a

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.300 
characters to do this story right it's a
minimum<00:02:02.569> live<00:02:03.569> because<00:02:03.869> four<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> minimum

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
minimum live because four is the minimum

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.800 
minimum live because four is the minimum
you<00:02:05.520> need<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.840> represent<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.619> society

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.229 

be<00:02:14.319> amazed<00:02:14.739> at<00:02:15.130> what<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:15.790> with<00:02:15.940> four

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
be amazed at what you can do with four

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.790 
be amazed at what you can do with four
characters<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.959> terms<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.380> what<00:02:17.590> they<00:02:17.770> can

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
characters in terms of what they can

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.030 
characters in terms of what they can
represent<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:19.270> larger<00:02:19.810> levels<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:23.010> refer<00:02:24.010> to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
represent on larger levels I refer to

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.220 
represent on larger levels I refer to
this<00:02:24.340> technique<00:02:24.910> as<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.230> four-point

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this technique as the four-point

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.390 
this technique as the four-point
opposition<00:02:27.099> or<00:02:27.790> corner<00:02:28.360> opposition<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:30.340> of

opposition or corner opposition one of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.229 
opposition or corner opposition one of
the<00:02:30.459> most<00:02:30.580> important<00:02:31.090> checking<00:02:31.540> signed<00:02:31.810> up

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the most important checking signed up

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.420 
the most important checking signed up
that<00:02:34.239> means<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:35.019> have<00:02:35.290> one<00:02:36.220> main

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
that means that we have one main

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:47.250 
that means that we have one main
character<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.680> three<00:02:39.099> opponents

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.830 

if<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.010> use<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.909> plan<00:02:49.150> opposition

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
if you use this for plan opposition

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.600 
if you use this for plan opposition
technique<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.739> gives<00:02:51.159> you<00:02:51.340> tremendous

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
technique it gives you tremendous

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.550 
technique it gives you tremendous
advantage<00:02:54.390> first<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.599> all<00:02:55.780> each<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.409> those

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
advantage first of all each of those

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.740 
advantage first of all each of those
characters<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.519> represent<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:58.390> different

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
characters can represent a different

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.440 
characters can represent a different
major<00:02:59.379> element<00:03:00.010> by<00:03:00.159> the<00:03:00.220> system<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:04.150> also

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
major element by the system it also

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.520 
major element by the system it also

this leads to another point you use the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.050 
this leads to another point you use the
four<00:04:08.840> point<00:04:09.110> opposite<00:04:09.500> won't<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.610> put<00:04:10.910> the
