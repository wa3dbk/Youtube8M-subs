00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
And so, after Benitez left we went to Fulham and hired Hodgsen.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.120
then we sold Mascherano, bought Paulsen and went 
 back to Fulham to bring Konchesky here.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.280
let's hope that Aquilani will get more playing time under Hodgsen.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
my führer... Aquilani....

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140
Aquilani was loaned out so we could afford paulsen's wage.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
but Lucas can play that position.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450
.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.440
everyone out except those who believe Lucas, Konchesky and Paulsen are good players.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's been twenty years. Twenty fucking years.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
since we won the league. Even Blackburn won it more recent than us.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
4 losses in 10 games is ridiculous.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:35.360
even Blackpool beat us infront of our own fans. 
 And why does Hodgsen keep playing Kyriagos?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.800
My führer Kyriagos scored against Blackpool.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
even Voronin could score against Blackpool!

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
my führer he scored as much as Torres this season.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
atleast Torres doesn't have a ponytail.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.280
..and a goatee.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.680
and besides, half the premier league scored more than Torres this season.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210
.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.200
we can't wait for Torres and gerard to wake 
 up when we're facing chelsea next week.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.200
how do we even expect to beat them when 
 we can't even beat Northampton in the cup?!

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.600
we couldn't even score more penalties than a League Two team

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
and then we expect the fans.. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to keep singing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.440
YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.400
it's ridiculous.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520
ridiculous.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010
.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
we lost the merseyside derby this season and still, they keep singing.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.880
it's as likely for us to win the 
 league as lucas winning the ballon d'or.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and can you tell me how we can expect 
 Kyriagos to keep Drogba from scoring next week?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.880
Don't worry, he'll probably mark Anelka.

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:10.530
even Berbatov scored 3 goals against us.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.880
and in that game.. Kyriagos didn't even play

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
we will lose.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680
same shit..

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.040
.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.840
.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.360
.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.680
different season.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.560
.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770
.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:41.200
what's next? will they sell Torres and Reina in January 
 and bring Almunia and Tshabalala to replace them?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.440
take my YNWA poster down.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570
.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.880
.
