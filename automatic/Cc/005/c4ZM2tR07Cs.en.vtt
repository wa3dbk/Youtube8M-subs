00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I've since lost to be honest let's go

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680 
I've since lost to be honest let's go
back<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> look<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> device<00:00:44.040> itself<00:00:44.690> okay

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
number of little icons on it which can

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
number of little icons on it which can
be<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.299> difficult<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.049> decipher

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
be a little bit difficult to decipher

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
be a little bit difficult to decipher
the<00:01:17.070> device<00:01:17.340> itself<00:01:17.700> takes<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.240> while

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the device itself takes a little while

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
the device itself takes a little while
to<00:01:18.540> boot<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.250> guess<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.520> only

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to boot up but I guess that's only

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.950 
to boot up but I guess that's only
expected<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.420> trying<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
expected what it's trying to do at the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.100 
expected what it's trying to do at the
moment<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.259> find<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.650> network<00:01:23.659> where<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> live

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
moment is find a network where I live

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
moment is find a network where I live
there<00:01:25.680> isn't<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.040> any<00:01:26.280> 3G<00:01:26.790> obviously<00:01:27.450> when

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
there isn't really any 3G obviously when

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
there isn't really any 3G obviously when
I'm<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> move<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> problem<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I'm on the move that's not a problem you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm on the move that's not a problem you
can<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.430> from<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> device<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
can see from the device so there are a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
can see from the device so there are a
number<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:31.020> icons<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> screen<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
number of little icons on the screen and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.230 
number of little icons on the screen and
I'll<00:01:32.189> talk<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
I'll talk a little bit more about that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880 
I'll talk a little bit more about that
but<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> best<00:01:34.380> features<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
but one of the best features in the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.410 
but one of the best features in the
bottom<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.369> hand<00:01:35.490> corner<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.270> can

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
bottom right hand corner there you can

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170 
bottom right hand corner there you can
see<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:37.350> much<00:01:37.530> data<00:01:37.829> you've<00:01:38.189> used<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> sim

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
see how much data you've used on the sim

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
see how much data you've used on the sim
that<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.600> inserted<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> device

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that you have inserted in the device

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.980 
that you have inserted in the device
which<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.220> useful<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> kind

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
which is very useful if you're on a kind

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
which is very useful if you're on a kind
of<00:01:43.079> fixed<00:01:43.439> payment<00:01:43.799> plan<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.070> something<00:01:44.579> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of fixed payment plan or something like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.319 
of fixed payment plan or something like
that<00:01:46.189> okay<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> keep

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that okay so it's it's going to keep

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.149 
that okay so it's it's going to keep
trying<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> find<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.990> network<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> as

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
trying to find a network here and as

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.410 
trying to find a network here and as
I've<00:01:50.310> said<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> find

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
I've said to you it's not going to find

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.850 
I've said to you it's not going to find
another<00:01:51.659> thing<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.110> sim<00:01:52.350> that's<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.680> here

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
another thing the sim that's in here

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.200 
another thing the sim that's in here
actually<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.700> I've<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.909> been

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
actually I think is one I've just been

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
actually I think is one I've just been
using<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> Netherlands<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.219> quite

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
using in the Netherlands so it's quite

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
using in the Netherlands so it's quite
likely<00:01:56.689> not<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> find<00:01:57.990> anything<00:01:58.439> at<00:01:58.560> all

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
likely not to find anything at all

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
likely not to find anything at all
obviously<00:02:00.450> boot-up<00:02:00.810> times<00:02:01.079> not<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> big

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
obviously boot-up times not really a big

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
obviously boot-up times not really a big
issue<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.640> obviously<00:02:03.299> most<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> time

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
issue because obviously most of the time

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.990 
issue because obviously most of the time
I<00:02:04.439> mean<00:02:04.619> typically<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> was<00:02:05.430> using<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
I mean typically when I was using it I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.869 
I mean typically when I was using it I
was<00:02:06.180> keeping<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.750> powered<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
was keeping it powered on it has a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.869 
was keeping it powered on it has a
battery<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.599> 2000<00:02:10.319> mAh<00:02:10.590> battery<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
battery in it's a 2000 mAh battery and I

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.160 
battery in it's a 2000 mAh battery and I
think<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.239> well<00:02:12.599> certainly<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.050> my

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
think it's well certainly in my

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
think it's well certainly in my
experience<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.680> good

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
experience it's good

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.080 
experience it's good
quite<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> few<00:02:14.690> hours<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.110> use<00:02:15.490> but<00:02:16.490> actually<00:02:16.880> if

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
quite a few hours of use but actually if

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.280 
quite a few hours of use but actually if
you're<00:02:17.210> using<00:02:17.420> other<00:02:17.690> kinds<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.110> mobile

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you're using other kinds of mobile

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.320 
you're using other kinds of mobile
devices<00:02:18.790> relatively<00:02:19.790> easy<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.090> keep<00:02:20.240> it

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
devices relatively easy to keep it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.150 
devices relatively easy to keep it
plugged<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.780> let's<00:02:21.380> open<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.740> back<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.070> have

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
plugged in let's open the back and have

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.700 
plugged in let's open the back and have
a<00:02:22.220> look<00:02:22.370> inside<00:02:22.810> okay<00:02:23.810> that's<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.110> spare<00:02:24.410> sim

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
a look inside okay that's a spare sim

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.960 
a look inside okay that's a spare sim
I'm<00:02:25.010> not<00:02:25.130> sure<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.430> you're<00:02:25.550> supposed<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.820> do

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
I'm not sure that you're supposed to do

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.970 
I'm not sure that you're supposed to do
that<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.330> found<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.720> useful<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.440> keep

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that but I found it useful just to keep

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.030 
that but I found it useful just to keep
a<00:02:28.310> spare<00:02:28.730> Sims<00:02:29.060> stuck<00:02:29.540> at<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> back<00:02:29.960> let's<00:02:30.920> get

yeah<00:02:35.980> 2000<00:02:37.000> mAh<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.300> mentioned<00:02:40.210> three<00:02:41.210> little

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
yeah 2000 mAh as mentioned three little

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.910 
yeah 2000 mAh as mentioned three little
contacts<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:42.050> showing<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.440> how<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.560> put<00:02:42.830> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
contacts there showing you how to put it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920 
contacts there showing you how to put it
in<00:02:43.040> inside<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.000> device<00:02:44.210> itself<00:02:44.540> obviously

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
in inside the device itself obviously

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.240 
in inside the device itself obviously
you<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.170> see<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.440> SIM<00:02:45.620> card<00:02:45.650> there's<00:02:46.010> also<00:02:46.130> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
you can see the SIM card there's also a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.710 
you can see the SIM card there's also a
slot<00:02:46.460> for<00:02:46.520> an<00:02:46.700> SD<00:02:46.760> card<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.390> believe<00:02:47.600> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
slot for an SD card and I believe it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.120 
slot for an SD card and I believe it
supports<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.790> 32<00:02:49.790> gig<00:02:50.290> SD<00:02:51.290> cards<00:02:53.890> okay<00:02:54.890> I'm

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
supports up to 32 gig SD cards okay I'm

it's<00:03:28.730> found<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.000> three<00:03:29.270> network<00:03:29.630> here<00:03:29.870> if<00:03:29.959> we

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
it's found the three network here if we

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.930 
it's found the three network here if we
look<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.350> bit<00:03:30.380> closer<00:03:30.800> at<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.220> screen<00:03:31.610> though

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
look a bit closer at the screen though

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.050 
look a bit closer at the screen though
you'll<00:03:32.900> see<00:03:33.080> from<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.380> icons<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.910> it's

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you'll see from the icons that it's

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.180 
you'll see from the icons that it's
telling<00:03:35.420> me<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.750> there<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.110> no<00:03:36.290> 3G<00:03:36.770> signal

telling me that there is no 3G signal

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.590 
telling me that there is no 3G signal
can<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.400> see<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:37.700> it'll<00:03:37.850> cross<00:03:38.150> next<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.510> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
can you see that it'll cross next to the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.570 
can you see that it'll cross next to the
3G<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.110> world<00:03:39.350> tells<00:03:39.770> us<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.280> network

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
3G the world tells us that the network

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.960 
3G the world tells us that the network
is<00:03:40.760> up<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.750> says<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.350> Wi-Fi<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.070> enabled<00:03:43.220> and

bog-standard cable I lost my charger for
this<00:03:55.160> but<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.430> uses<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.850> same<00:03:56.150> charger<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:56.780> my

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
this but it uses the same charger as my

in UK 3-pin but I've got to pin devices

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.939 
in UK 3-pin but I've got to pin devices
where<00:04:33.240> I'm<00:04:33.360> traveling<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.020> basically<00:04:34.800> if

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
where I'm traveling so basically if

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.499 
where I'm traveling so basically if
you've<00:04:35.100> got<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.729> kind<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.060> phone<00:04:36.240> that's<00:04:36.419> got

you've got the kind of phone that's got

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.909 
you've got the kind of phone that's got
a<00:04:36.570> mini<00:04:36.750> USB<00:04:36.960> port<00:04:37.850> you're<00:04:38.850> good<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.120> go<00:04:39.150> really

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
a mini USB port you're good to go really

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.710 
a mini USB port you're good to go really
and<00:04:40.919> actually<00:04:41.370> rather<00:04:42.060> than<00:04:42.240> carrying<00:04:42.509> about

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
and actually rather than carrying about

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.990 
and actually rather than carrying about
four<00:04:43.020> charges<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:44.220> nice<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.610> have<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.759> device

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
four charges it's nice to have a device

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.120 
four charges it's nice to have a device
that<00:04:45.300> shares<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.840> same<00:04:45.870> connection<00:04:46.560> Apple

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
that shares the same connection Apple

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.740 
that shares the same connection Apple
users<00:04:47.460> may<00:04:47.669> feel<00:04:47.910> differently<00:04:48.330> about<00:04:48.419> that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
users may feel differently about that

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.659 
users may feel differently about that
obviously<00:04:49.050> let's<00:04:49.919> have<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.100> quick<00:04:50.280> look<00:04:50.310> at<00:04:50.550> the

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
obviously let's have a quick look at the

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.210 
obviously let's have a quick look at the
interface<00:04:51.090> itself<00:04:51.630> okay<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.860> my<00:04:53.009> laptop

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
interface itself okay this is my laptop

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.770 
interface itself okay this is my laptop
so<00:04:53.699> it's<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.970> little<00:04:54.120> bit<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.449> a<00:04:54.479> different

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
so it's a little bit of a different

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.210 
so it's a little bit of a different
resolution<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.620> it<00:04:55.710> looks<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.919> bit<00:04:55.949> strange

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
resolution so if it looks a bit strange

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.490 
resolution so if it looks a bit strange
that's<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.850> reason<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.020> wanted<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.289> show

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
that's the reason but I wanted to show

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.010 
that's the reason but I wanted to show
you<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:59.039> real<00:04:59.190> world<00:04:59.490> so<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:00.840> my

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
you it in the real world so this is my

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.629 
you it in the real world so this is my
laptop<00:05:01.380> we're<00:05:01.800> running<00:05:02.009> Linux<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:02.490> I'm<00:05:02.550> just

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
laptop we're running Linux so I'm just

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.310 
laptop we're running Linux so I'm just
going<00:05:02.759> to<00:05:02.849> connect<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.449> tp-link<00:05:03.870> rather

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
going to connect to the tp-link rather

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.070 
going to connect to the tp-link rather
than<00:05:04.500> my<00:05:04.620> home<00:05:04.830> network<00:05:05.599> okay<00:05:06.599> so<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.810> takes<00:05:06.990> a

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
than my home network okay so it takes a

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.749 
than my home network okay so it takes a
