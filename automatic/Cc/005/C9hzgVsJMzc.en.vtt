00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.750
 Here we have an objectively called the association called grows which is there for 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.439
 Pasted over to posters here would advance to Micro Four Thirds camera 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.330
 "Let's start now," said Martin Jol 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.159
 self-processed 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.159
 60 in the short term as practical together 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.519
 I suppose Ernst means 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.819
 the objective 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:29.279
 After that, a marker has always small mark 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.869
 Phrases the two actions open 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.720
 in Kandern with a rotary movement 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.690
 lens 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.540
 Panalpina exactly that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.649
 is this objectively equipped 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.650
 Shortcoming contract 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.140
 the camera can be brought 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.800
 there always what the objectively down looking for the connection mark 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 Camacho at the markets 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.470
 here and here 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.320
 the sentences stumbling block 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.270
 streibich 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.820
 attached to the camera 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.740
 handy small 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.740
 manufacturers 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.860
 to take pictures 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.970
 Make sure that both Aretz and the internal celebration 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.670
 be set 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.550
 kick-ass just go 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.910
 and there we were to take things apart again 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 First, take the lens taken by the camera 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.880
 so it provides APA again 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 last week in Europe 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.420
 then it is clogged again 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.730
 Contactor percent 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.730
 Time should go against the world 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.230
 because to separate objectively 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.060
 this secured was also a recognition 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.130
 Although local residents continue to talk 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.580
 so 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.620
 There are none 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.760
 catfish have been seen over there now 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.980
 Away from the objective 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 Mr. company 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.450
 whether the complaints also content 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.539
 almost 100 years 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.769
 that Karas
