grand theft auto 5 and specifically a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.110 
grand theft auto 5 and specifically a
fix<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.830> I've<00:00:13.950> discovered<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.490> help<00:00:14.670> improve

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
fix that I've discovered to help improve

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.689 
fix that I've discovered to help improve
the<00:00:15.269> frame<00:00:15.630> rates<00:00:15.839> considerably<00:00:16.699> probably

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the frame rates considerably probably

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.550 
the frame rates considerably probably
for<00:00:17.880> pretty<00:00:18.150> much<00:00:18.240> everyone<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.109> definitely

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
for pretty much everyone it's definitely

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.980 
for pretty much everyone it's definitely
helped<00:00:19.859> me<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:21.300> some<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> areas

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
helped me out a lot in some of the areas

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.420 
helped me out a lot in some of the areas
where<00:00:22.109> I've<00:00:22.230> seen<00:00:22.470> framerate<00:00:22.800> drops<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
where I've seen framerate drops and that

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.859 
where I've seen framerate drops and that
I've<00:00:23.519> seen<00:00:23.670> other<00:00:23.910> people<00:00:24.000> talking<00:00:24.600> about

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
I've seen other people talking about

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
I've seen other people talking about
specifically<00:00:25.769> outside<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.640> city<00:00:26.910> where

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
specifically outside the city where

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.460 
specifically outside the city where
you're<00:00:27.300> getting<00:00:27.599> these<00:00:27.720> higher<00:00:28.080> draw

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you're getting these higher draw

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800 
you're getting these higher draw
distances<00:00:29.390> happening<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:30.750> you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
distances happening you know when you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.530 
distances happening you know when you
could<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.109> way<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.560> off<00:00:31.800> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> distance

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
could see way way off into the distance

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
could see way way off into the distance
sometimes<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> 2<00:00:33.960> 980<00:00:34.350> s<00:00:34.500> dropping<00:00:35.160> all

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
sometimes on the 2 980 s dropping all

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.910 
sometimes on the 2 980 s dropping all
the<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.520> down<00:00:35.790> into<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> mid<00:00:36.420> 40s<00:00:36.800> from<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the way down into the mid 40s from you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.889 
the way down into the mid 40s from you
know<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.340> fps<00:00:39.030> until<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.660> into

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
know from my fps until I get back into

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.420 
know from my fps until I get back into
the<00:00:40.050> city<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.379> areas<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.040> it'll<00:00:41.219> shoot

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the city of areas and then it'll shoot

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.540 
the city of areas and then it'll shoot
back<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> did<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:43.980> ahead<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
back up so what I did to go ahead and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
back up so what I did to go ahead and
fix<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.329> adjusted<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.289> specific

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
fix this was I adjusted one specific

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
fix this was I adjusted one specific
option<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.719> in

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
option and it's this one right here in

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.830 
option and it's this one right here in
the<00:00:48.899> advanced<00:00:49.620> graphics<00:00:50.340> tab<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.120> extended

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the advanced graphics tab it's extended

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.700 
the advanced graphics tab it's extended
distance<00:00:52.230> scaling<00:00:53.090> now<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> went<00:00:54.480> around<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
distance scaling now I went around and I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
distance scaling now I went around and I
tried<00:00:55.980> tweaking<00:00:56.370> multiple<00:00:56.820> options<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.840> this

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
tried tweaking multiple options but this

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
tried tweaking multiple options but this
is<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> made<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.160> largest<00:00:59.820> impact

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
is the one that made the largest impact

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
is the one that made the largest impact
for<00:01:00.600> me<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.500> terms<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.010> performance<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.579> would

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
for me in terms of performance I would

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
for me in terms of performance I would
say<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.120> lowering<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> more<00:01:04.350> open

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
say by lowering this in the more open

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.760 
say by lowering this in the more open
areas<00:01:04.979> I've<00:01:05.189> seen<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.670> FPS<00:01:06.240> go<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:07.380> anywhere

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
areas I've seen my FPS go up by anywhere

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.420 
areas I've seen my FPS go up by anywhere
from<00:01:08.040> 15<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.479> high<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.689> 40<00:01:10.470> frames<00:01:11.100> per

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
from 15 to as high as 40 frames per

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.370 
from 15 to as high as 40 frames per
second<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.689> even<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
second now if you can even see it here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
second now if you can even see it here
it<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.830> does<00:01:14.100> adjust<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.420> vram

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it really does adjust now the vram

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
it really does adjust now the vram
counter<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:16.979> arguably

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
counter on this is you know arguably

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.300 
counter on this is you know arguably
it's<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> broken<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.619> terms<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.100> how<00:01:20.189> much

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it's kind of broken in terms of how much

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
it's kind of broken in terms of how much
video<00:01:20.460> memory<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> says<00:01:21.000> overall<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
video memory it says overall but you can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.920 
video memory it says overall but you can
kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> general<00:01:23.520> scale<00:01:23.930> you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
kind of use it as a general scale you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
kind of use it as a general scale you
know<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.040> increasing<00:01:26.790> by

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
know that for what it is increasing by

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.330 
know that for what it is increasing by
and<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.439> turn<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and if you see if I turn this up here

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
and if you see if I turn this up here
did<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> vram<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.960> straight

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
did you see the vram just going straight

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.340 
did you see the vram just going straight
up<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.549> even<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.479> me<00:01:33.659> even<00:01:33.990> though<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> wasn't

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
up so even for me even though I wasn't

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
up so even for me even though I wasn't
really<00:01:34.500> maxing<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.280> video<00:01:35.579> memory<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
really maxing out my video memory I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
really maxing out my video memory I
wasn't<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.329> over<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.570> 3.7<00:01:37.530> gigabytes<00:01:37.920> of

open areas and turning this down like I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.710 
open areas and turning this down like I

said has improved my FPS on average like

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.980 
said has improved my FPS on average like
15<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> 40<00:01:46.530> FPS<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.880> also<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
15 to 40 FPS and also in the the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.929 
15 to 40 FPS and also in the the
benchmark<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.740> went<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.759> from<00:01:51.030> 60<00:01:51.649> 7.8

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
benchmark I went all the way from 60 7.8

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.469 
benchmark I went all the way from 60 7.8
FPS<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.360> over<00:01:54.750> 90<00:01:55.320> average<00:01:56.130> FPS<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.939> when

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
FPS to up over 90 average FPS and when

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.609 
FPS to up over 90 average FPS and when
we<00:01:57.570> close<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> video<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
we close out the video I'm going to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.920 
we close out the video I'm going to
actually<00:01:59.009> run<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.520> benchmarks<00:02:00.270> side-by-side

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
actually run the benchmarks side-by-side

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.450 
actually run the benchmarks side-by-side
again<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> guys<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.430> my

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
again for you guys like I did in my

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
again for you guys like I did in my
benchmark<00:02:02.969> comparison<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.320> see

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
benchmark comparison just so you can see

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
benchmark comparison just so you can see
side-by-side<00:02:04.740> how<00:02:05.369> drastic<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.060> difference

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
side-by-side how drastic a difference

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
side-by-side how drastic a difference
you<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> FPS<00:02:07.920> performance<00:02:08.429> with

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you will see in the FPS performance with

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.010 
you will see in the FPS performance with
everything<00:02:08.940> else<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> game<00:02:09.450> cranked<00:02:09.899> up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
everything else in the game cranked up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.199 
everything else in the game cranked up
and<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.250> option<00:02:11.489> turned<00:02:11.910> down<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and just this one option turned down I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.680 
and just this one option turned down I
was

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
was

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.170 
was
being<00:02:12.810> able<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.110> turn<00:02:13.320> up<00:02:13.440> my<00:02:13.530> MSA<00:02:13.980> my<00:02:14.430> MSA<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> up

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
being able to turn up my MSA my MSA a up

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.780 
being able to turn up my MSA my MSA a up
to<00:02:15.390> four<00:02:15.930> times<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.440> not<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> as<00:02:17.340> impact

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to four times and not have it as impact

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.760 
to four times and not have it as impact
my<00:02:17.940> frame<00:02:18.210> rate<00:02:18.240> as<00:02:18.510> much<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.350> specific

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
my frame rate as much with this specific

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.460 
my frame rate as much with this specific
option<00:02:20.400> turned<00:02:21.030> down<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.140> you're<00:02:22.350> out

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
option turned down so if you're out

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.960 
option turned down so if you're out
there<00:02:22.680> running<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:23.040> maybe<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> lower<00:02:23.640> video

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
there running on maybe on a lower video

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.520 
there running on maybe on a lower video
memory<00:02:24.150> system<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.720> two<00:02:24.900> gigabyte<00:02:25.260> card

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
memory system like a two gigabyte card

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.930 
memory system like a two gigabyte card
this<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.800> definitely<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.520> those<00:02:26.640> options

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
this is definitely one of those options

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.640 
this is definitely one of those options
you're<00:02:27.270> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> want<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.690> turn<00:02:27.840> down<00:02:27.870> maybe

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
you're going to want to turn down maybe

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.950 
you're going to want to turn down maybe
along<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.070> msaa<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.270> couple<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.690> others

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
we're going to go into the benchmark and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.510 
we're going to go into the benchmark and
that's<00:02:46.710> going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.920> close<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.190> out<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.460> the
