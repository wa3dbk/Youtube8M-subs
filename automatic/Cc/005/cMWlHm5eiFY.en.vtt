00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
played need for speed I there's no blank

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.209 
played need for speed I there's no blank
after<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:14.139> it's<00:00:14.320> just<00:00:14.440> need<00:00:14.769> for<00:00:15.009> speed

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
after that it's just need for speed

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.760 
after that it's just need for speed
because<00:00:15.580> they're<00:00:15.759> rebooting<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.450> series<00:00:16.779> we

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
minutes a demo of actual gameplay and

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.380 
minutes a demo of actual gameplay and
where<00:00:23.739> I<00:00:23.770> raced<00:00:24.099> against<00:00:24.460> well<00:00:25.029> I<00:00:25.060> wouldn't

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
where I raced against well I wouldn't

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.120 
where I raced against well I wouldn't

I played against about seven other

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.490 
I played against about seven other
people<00:00:30.070> now<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:31.509> way<00:00:31.689> that<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.140> new<00:00:32.290> need<00:00:32.470> for

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
people now the way that the new need for

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.790 
people now the way that the new need for
speed<00:00:32.680> works<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.340> that<00:00:33.370> there<00:00:33.760> isn't<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.210> much

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
speed works is that there isn't so much

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.170 
speed works is that there isn't so much
objectives<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:35.980> goals<00:00:36.040> but<00:00:36.489> it's<00:00:36.640> an<00:00:36.790> open

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
objectives and goals but it's an open

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.330 
objectives and goals but it's an open
world<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.900> there's<00:00:38.350> different<00:00:38.740> narrative

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
world and there's different narrative

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.830 
world and there's different narrative
threads<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.090> can<00:00:40.210> go<00:00:40.390> through<00:00:40.630> there's

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
threads that you can go through there's

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.540 
threads that you can go through there's
a<00:00:40.900> speed<00:00:41.260> thread<00:00:41.590> there's<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:41.890> style<00:00:42.220> thread

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
a speed thread there's a style thread

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.610 
a speed thread there's a style thread
there's<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.850> build<00:00:43.120> thread<00:00:43.360> there's<00:00:44.050> an<00:00:44.230> outlaw

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
there's a build thread there's an outlaw

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.830 
there's a build thread there's an outlaw
thread<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.160> there's<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.430> drift<00:00:45.760> thread<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.540> so

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
thread and there's a drift thread and so

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.810 
thread and there's a drift thread and so
what<00:00:47.050> we<00:00:47.170> did<00:00:47.410> in<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.680> demo<00:00:47.950> was<00:00:48.310> we<00:00:48.460> started

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
what we did in the demo was we started

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.520 
what we did in the demo was we started
off<00:00:48.940> with<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.150> quick<00:00:49.390> race<00:00:49.780> against<00:00:50.290> each<00:00:50.380> other

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
off with a quick race against each other

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.710 
off with a quick race against each other
but<00:00:50.710> after<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.160> we<00:00:51.430> were<00:00:51.850> free<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.300> explore

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
but after that we were free to explore

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.960 
but after that we were free to explore
this<00:00:52.960> open<00:00:53.290> world<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:54.100> do<00:00:54.250> whatever<00:00:54.430> we<00:00:54.730> could

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
this open world and do whatever we could

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.030 
this open world and do whatever we could
to<00:00:55.030> earn<00:00:55.360> style<00:00:55.780> points<00:00:55.989> whether<00:00:56.290> that's<00:00:56.590> how

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
to earn style points whether that's how

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.940 
to earn style points whether that's how
fast<00:00:57.340> we're<00:00:57.579> going<00:00:57.930> drifting<00:00:58.930> messing<00:00:59.800> with

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
fast we're going drifting messing with

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.830 
fast we're going drifting messing with
the<00:01:00.040> cops<00:01:00.280> doing<00:01:00.970> whatever<00:01:01.210> we<00:01:01.420> want<00:01:01.480> is

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
the cops doing whatever we want is

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.479 
the cops doing whatever we want is
basically<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.470> add<00:01:02.680> a<00:01:02.710> point<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.370> then

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
basically to add a point and then

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.889 
basically to add a point and then
whoever<00:01:03.850> had<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.089> most<00:01:04.269> points<00:01:04.659> at<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.809> end

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
whoever had the most points at the end

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.960 
whoever had the most points at the end
of<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.170> session<00:01:05.379> one<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.549> mean<00:01:06.700> there<00:01:06.790> was<00:01:06.880> no

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
of the session one I mean there was no

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.770 
of the session one I mean there was no
prizes<00:01:07.299> but<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:08.710> was<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:08.979> kind<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.400> way<00:01:09.550> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
prizes but it was just kind of a way to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.940 
prizes but it was just kind of a way to
to<00:01:10.780> show<00:01:10.990> off<00:01:11.200> all<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.530> different

somewhat<00:03:54.959> responsive<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.889> had<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.609> lot<00:03:56.790> of

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
somewhat responsive I had a lot of

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.879 
somewhat responsive I had a lot of
trouble<00:03:57.290> train<00:03:58.290> engage<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:59.549> know<00:03:59.690> how<00:04:00.690> to

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
time to adjust my handling because we

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.099 
time to adjust my handling because we
have<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> get<00:04:06.180> through<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.449> customization

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
have to get through the customization

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
lot of time doing was trying to struggle

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.360 
lot of time doing was trying to struggle
whether<00:04:12.989> or<00:04:13.109> not<00:04:13.199> I<00:04:13.260> had<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.560> slow<00:04:13.769> down<00:04:13.979> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
whether or not I had to slow down and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.580 
whether or not I had to slow down and
turn<00:04:14.909> or<00:04:15.150> drift<00:04:15.359> in<00:04:15.479> turn<00:04:15.629> I<00:04:15.780> tried<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.079> both<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
turn or drift in turn I tried it both I

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.229 
turn or drift in turn I tried it both I
didn't<00:04:17.099> really<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.579> of<00:04:17.639> success<00:04:18.150> with

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
didn't really have a lot of success with

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.120 
didn't really have a lot of success with
each<00:04:18.539> so<00:04:19.169> it's<00:04:19.409> only<00:04:19.560> gonna<00:04:19.769> take<00:04:19.889> some

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
each so it's only gonna take some

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.920 
each so it's only gonna take some
getting<00:04:20.400> used<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.510> other<00:04:21.630> thing<00:04:21.840> I

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
getting used to the other thing I

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.750 
getting used to the other thing I
noticed<00:04:22.289> is<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.500> when<00:04:22.979> i<00:04:23.010> change<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.490> camera

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
noticed is that when i change the camera

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.240 
noticed is that when i change the camera
when<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.060> went<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.389> bumper<00:04:24.570> cam<00:04:25.250> everything

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
when I went to the bumper cam everything

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.399 
when I went to the bumper cam everything
was<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> lot<00:04:27.000> darker<00:04:27.330> than<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.659> was<00:04:27.900> when<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.139> had

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
was a lot darker than it was when I had

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.719 
was a lot darker than it was when I had
a<00:04:28.469> further<00:04:28.950> back<00:04:29.250> camera

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
a further back camera

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.939 
a further back camera
see<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.969> car<00:04:30.180> uh<00:04:30.659> the<00:04:31.319> game<00:04:31.499> doesn't<00:04:31.680> take

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
see the car uh the game doesn't take

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.399 
see the car uh the game doesn't take
place<00:04:32.309> in<00:04:32.520> perpetual<00:04:33.150> night<00:04:33.330> but<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.259> goes

a<00:04:44.129> really<00:04:44.309> nighttime<00:04:44.789> unless<00:04:45.089> there<00:04:45.360> is

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
a really nighttime unless there is

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
buildings around it's very hard to see

where<00:04:50.729> you're<00:04:50.789> going<00:04:50.849> in<00:04:51.240> pumper<00:04:51.599> can<00:04:51.809> I<00:04:52.080> ask

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
where you're going in pumper can I ask

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.409 
where you're going in pumper can I ask
the<00:04:53.039> developers<00:04:53.580> about<00:04:53.819> that<00:04:53.999> after<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
the developers about that after the

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.089 
the developers about that after the
session<00:04:54.689> was<00:04:54.870> over<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.529> I<00:04:55.589> said<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:55.919> would

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
session was over and I said that would

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.649 
session was over and I said that would
change<00:04:56.339> in<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.610> final<00:04:56.909> version<00:04:57.089> and<00:04:57.419> it<00:04:57.509> would

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
change in the final version and it would

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.390 
change in the final version and it would
still<00:04:57.900> be<00:04:57.960> like<00:04:58.229> that<00:04:58.469> but<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:59.159> was

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
still be like that but it was

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.670 
still be like that but it was
disconcerting<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.360> did<00:05:00.539> take<00:05:00.719> away<00:05:01.020> from

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
disconcerting and I did take away from

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.980 
disconcerting and I did take away from
the<00:05:01.830> experience<00:05:01.889> a<00:05:02.309> little<00:05:02.460> bit<00:05:02.580> I<00:05:02.969> would<00:05:03.839> say

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
the experience a little bit I would say

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.350 
the experience a little bit I would say
that<00:05:04.199> this<00:05:04.319> is<00:05:04.559> more<00:05:04.889> of<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:05.219> game<00:05:05.430> who<00:05:05.699> for

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
that this is more of a game who for

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.079 
that this is more of a game who for
people<00:05:06.659> who<00:05:06.779> are<00:05:06.930> really<00:05:06.960> into<00:05:07.669> style<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:08.999> the

right<00:05:23.219> now<00:05:23.249> I<00:05:23.550> mean<00:05:23.789> as<00:05:23.969> great<00:05:24.749> of<00:05:24.779> a<00:05:24.960> game<00:05:25.139> as

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
right now I mean as great of a game as

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.399 
right now I mean as great of a game as
Forza<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:25.939> it's<00:05:26.939> not<00:05:27.149> really<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.539> same<00:05:27.689> level

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
Forza is it's not really the same level

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.889 
Forza is it's not really the same level
when<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:29.009> comes<00:05:29.219> to<00:05:29.430> just<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.389> current

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:30.899 
when it comes to just the current

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:32.360 
when it comes to just the current

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
going to be a need for speed so it's

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.179 
going to be a need for speed so it's
it's<00:05:36.870> definitely<00:05:37.289> different<00:05:37.529> from<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:38.039> other

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:39.499 
it's definitely different from the other
games<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.520> are<00:05:38.669> being<00:05:38.789> offered<00:05:38.999> right<00:05:39.330> now

games that are being offered right now

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.949 
games that are being offered right now
but<00:05:40.469> that's<00:05:41.129> not<00:05:41.310> necessarily<00:05:41.699> a<00:05:42.149> bad<00:05:42.389> thing<00:05:42.449> I

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:42.959 
but that's not necessarily a bad thing I

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.290 
but that's not necessarily a bad thing I
had<00:05:43.289> a<00:05:43.319> good<00:05:43.589> time<00:05:43.830> playing<00:05:44.580> it<00:05:44.879> even<00:05:45.180> though

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
