in the routines that you're about to see
you're<00:00:03.210> gonna<00:00:03.389> see<00:00:03.570> us<00:00:03.720> using<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> Smith

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
you're gonna see us using the Smith

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.160 
you're gonna see us using the Smith
machine<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.220> lot<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.060> guys<00:00:06.240> are<00:00:06.299> gonna<00:00:06.839> talk

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
and you're gonna say the Smith machine

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.129 
and you're gonna say the Smith machine
is<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.450> pussies

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139

okay a few years ago I would have agreed
with<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.950> Smith<00:00:14.190> machine<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.089> pussies

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
with the Smith machine is for pussies

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.910 
with the Smith machine is for pussies
matter<00:00:15.690> fact<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.960> might<00:00:16.139> even<00:00:16.289> agree<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.680> you

motherfucker like me that's been been
spreading<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.550> 30<00:00:23.760> years<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.750> allows<00:00:24.869> me<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
spreading for 30 years it allows me to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.089 
spreading for 30 years it allows me to
stay<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> same<00:00:26.070> groove<00:00:26.730> every<00:00:27.359> time<00:00:27.660> I

can't get out the groove

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
can't get out the groove
cuz<00:00:30.420> Smith<00:00:30.689> machine<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.260> locked<00:00:31.590> into

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
cuz Smith machine is locked into

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.510 
cuz Smith machine is locked into
position<00:00:32.719> that's<00:00:33.719> why<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.590> use<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> strip

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
position that's why I use the strip
