anything<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> painted<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
anything like that when I painted and

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
anything like that when I painted and
that's<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:24.990> much<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.520> looks

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that's that's pretty much it looks

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
that's that's pretty much it looks
pretty<00:01:26.700> decent<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> first<00:01:27.659> attempt<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
pretty decent for the first attempt I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.130 
pretty decent for the first attempt I
suppose<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> blue<00:01:30.140> looks

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
suppose I really like the blue looks

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
suppose I really like the blue looks
really<00:01:31.409> sweet<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> metallic<00:01:33.090> flake

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
really sweet with all the metallic flake

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.310 
really sweet with all the metallic flake
in<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:35.869> cutouts<00:01:36.869> could<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.170> been<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
in there the cutouts could have been a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
in there the cutouts could have been a
little<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.740> cleaner<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:39.060> first<00:01:39.299> time

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
little bit cleaner but as my first time

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
little bit cleaner but as my first time
really<00:01:39.630> using<00:01:40.079> exacto<00:01:40.500> knife<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.040> type

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
really using exacto knife for this type

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
really using exacto knife for this type
of<00:01:41.220> thing<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.450> overall<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.710> looks

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
of thing but overall I think it looks

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
of thing but overall I think it looks
pretty<00:01:43.920> decent<00:01:44.450> even<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> guide<00:01:46.350> button

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pretty decent even with the guide button

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
pretty decent even with the guide button

and<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.530> actual<00:02:16.420> circuitry<00:02:17.420> circuit<00:02:18.080> board

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
and the actual circuitry circuit board

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.509 
and the actual circuitry circuit board
here<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.620> your<00:02:18.800> rumble<00:02:19.069> packs<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
far as the custom design i'm going to

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.660 
far as the custom design i'm going to
use<00:02:29.200> i'll<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.380> back<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.709> everybody<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:31.640> I

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
use i'll get back to everybody when I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.300 
use i'll get back to everybody when I
get<00:02:31.910> there<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.650> another<00:02:33.920> one<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
get there and I have another one in the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.479 
get there and I have another one in the
in<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:34.970> wings<00:02:35.290> thinking<00:02:36.290> about<00:02:36.380> doing<00:02:36.680> their

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
in the wings thinking about doing their

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.759 
in the wings thinking about doing their
design<00:02:37.849> which<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.690> haven't<00:02:39.140> fully<00:02:39.440> put

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
design which I haven't fully put

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.500 
design which I haven't fully put
together<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.130> idea<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.700> yet<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.239> when<00:02:41.360> i<00:02:41.390> do

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
together the idea for yet but when i do

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.740 
together the idea for yet but when i do
i'll<00:02:41.780> post<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.260> up<00:02:42.380> video<00:02:42.680> too<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.849> everyone

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
i'll post that up video too so everyone

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.160 
i'll post that up video too so everyone
can<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.410> see<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.739> got<00:02:47.049> hope<00:02:48.049> this

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
can can see what I got hope this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.140 
can can see what I got hope this
controller<00:02:48.560> looks<00:02:49.400> pretty<00:02:49.670> good<00:02:49.790> everybody

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
controller looks pretty good everybody

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150 
controller looks pretty good everybody
else<00:02:50.330> out<00:02:50.510> there<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.930> think<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.130> lot
