awesome<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:35.600> see<00:00:36.600> ya<00:00:36.719> makes<00:00:36.930> number<00:00:37.050> 10

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
awesome so see ya makes number 10

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
awesome so see ya makes number 10
because<00:00:37.739> there<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:38.370> more

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
because there was just a lot more

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100 
because there was just a lot more
buildings<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.059> were<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> lot

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
buildings that were like you know a lot

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.770 
buildings that were like you know a lot
cooler<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.969> think<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> big

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
cooler than it I just think that the big

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
cooler than it I just think that the big
wall<00:00:43.020> makes<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.500> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> look<00:00:43.800> stupid<00:00:44.219> but

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
wall makes it kind of look stupid but

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.740 
wall makes it kind of look stupid but
whatever<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.180> umm<00:00:45.809> yeah<00:00:46.340> it's<00:00:47.340> okay

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
whatever so umm yeah it's okay

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.010 
whatever so umm yeah it's okay
