00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.849
 This is a good personal settings 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 only this is here 7 37 70 here 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:32.820
 the processor is 22 nanometers in the asus 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 2 2133mhz altino martins five says 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 that the group of the processor 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:45.000
 overclock here is showing 1,600 more 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.140
 we are there with four points and only 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.140
 take a look here 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.339
 we're at the temperature and at 36 degrees 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 or 33 degrees and the video card is in 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.840
 stock in geforce gtx 60 and 80 with drive 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.120
 300 10.90 from nvidia 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 We're going to test nothing less than the 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.400
 the villain of the current machines is that the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.120
 fat wai 3 fully updated with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.329
 four current pieces 1.1.2 1.4 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.729
 and nvidia kondratiev also updated nÃ© 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.079
 let's take advantage of the frequency of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.850
 Memories of the thousand gestfin 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.710
 let's take advantage of a top motherboard of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.229
 line jesus will return to games that give 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.110
 home line so there are martins five rips 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.680
 let's take advantage of the focus of the 3770 car 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.360
 4.6 ghz and we will also take the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.020
 optimization of the most 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.500
 current 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.799
 beauty let's see how it works 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 and fair play 3 on that girl of that machine 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.770
 and what will be the rate of females 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.770
 so come on 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.720
 that's it there was 3 for the frames I do not even know 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.660
 if the province follow anyone 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.550
 in the left corner of the goal 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.300
 her how high and how it is going to be 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.300
 15 vehicles 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.660
 the maximum 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.370
 the staff when I put my 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:51.019
 configurations here at most in our 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.740
 game so heavy blow was 3 launched a 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.420
 time 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.650
 kisses 3 and we are facing mars one 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.190
 graphic quality this time the link here 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.600
 I keep asking myself, one will be 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.600
 What will the future be? 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.230
 because everyone in expectation of xbox 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.270
 playstation 4 executive action 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.270
 I have no expectation that it exists in 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:28.240
 me 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:31.560
 It was curious to see what the bet is 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.560
 sony and microsoft 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.580
 regarding improvements because they already 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.430
 I was on time, right? 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.550
 moreover the team will continue only 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.069
 have people look at the pc 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.200
 to windows platform as you wheel one 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.940
 time by quality 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.360
 was already more than us because I was with 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.360
 a sure kind only vidic 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.500
 a game that can swallow the console 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.019
 area are saying such because people 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.780
 We put it there when I'm 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.280
 playstation 3 was from 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.790
 the progress of the study in relation 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.260
 the pc was very much in front of us 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.389
 were 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.280
 we did have this 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.859
 was still in the games area was already 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.259
 if you get involved and have your name you do not have 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.560
 five years or four years 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:32.200
 playstation 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.710
 The xbox I get upset but has four years 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.960
 right then 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:43.800
 happens 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.680
 us in five years but too evolved the 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.190
 relaunched the raja accumulation solutions 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.610
 of cooling is problems that we 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.500
 We faced more faces 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.710
 produced positive or processors 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.160
 in 22 kilometers thing nobody 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.150
 imaginava is the intel now announced the 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.569
 production of 14-nanometer sensors 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.039
 right 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.800
 this will facilitate the drop in consumption 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.740
 energy right not to facilitate mine 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.259
 low voltage is to facilitate 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.710
 eco office or more frequency for 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:23.280
 we see in more production more and until 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.370
 data processes 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.650
 Let's have a be good wine and use more 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.669
 strong and nothing more nothing less people 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.699
 because it is in the console it is done 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.789
 the fact is that eight episodes 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:43.370
 graphic that rounds today's help 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.699
 I have another one there and it's a gp or very read 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.639
 right 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.900
 sony is launching there the playstation 4 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.900
 she really likes 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.400
 the goal 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.740
 we are betting a lot 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.370
 16 14 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.009
 it is 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.089
 8.2 goose 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.089
 the sun 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.960
 there nothing is to be one needs to be improved 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.260
 with respect to the brave and if not going to roll 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.580
 4 14 girls and could create because it 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.860
 we 'll have to put up if at cost 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:33.169
 Right end and this is my Portuguese 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.160
 good people psychic age 3630 fight 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.270
 28 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.270
 every three days 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:51.899
 I 'm very good, very curious to see. 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:56.659
 that's where it got stuck on your site a stretch 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.659
 weak giving there three more cars boats 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.919
 ae 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 ae 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.520
 the people would be another video rp3 nor 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.060
 I will count on him in 2010 polysom and 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:12.150
 employees 

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:15.390
 I want to thank the one thousand subscribers 

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.760
 the lines almost 45 thousand views and 

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.940
 a hug even more 

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.940
 went
