this is a story about gold mining

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.400 
this is a story about gold mining
there's<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.179> huge<00:00:12.179> number<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> people<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.320> the

there's a huge number of people in the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.369 
there's a huge number of people in the
world<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.769> are<00:00:14.750> generally<00:00:15.750> poor<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.199> there

world that are generally poor in there

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
world that are generally poor in there
in<00:00:16.440> developing<00:00:16.800> countries<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:18.390> they

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
in developing countries and when they

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260 
in developing countries and when they
find<00:00:19.140> usually<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:19.859> happenstance<00:00:20.270> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
find usually by happenstance the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.599 
find usually by happenstance the
positive<00:00:21.689> gold<00:00:21.980> they<00:00:22.980> start<00:00:23.220> digging<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> up

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
positive gold they start digging it up

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.240 
positive gold they start digging it up
and<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.480> fairly<00:00:24.720> simple<00:00:24.840> process<00:00:25.250> except

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and it's a fairly simple process except

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.519 
and it's a fairly simple process except
that<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.699> order<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.150> get<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.840> most<00:00:28.019> gold<00:00:28.289> as

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
that in order to get the most gold as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.279 
that in order to get the most gold as
possible<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.119> dirt<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.050> have

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
possible out of the or the dirt you have

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.470 
possible out of the or the dirt you have
to<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.590> mercury<00:00:31.830> which<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:32.969> everyone<00:00:33.450> knows

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to use mercury which as everyone knows

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.500 
to use mercury which as everyone knows
is<00:00:33.780> extraordinarily<00:00:34.620> toxic<00:00:35.520> compound<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
is extraordinarily toxic compound and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
is extraordinarily toxic compound and
the<00:00:36.899> mercury<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.469> running<00:00:37.920> off<00:00:38.100> not<00:00:38.520> only<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the mercury is running off not only in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580 
the mercury is running off not only in
the<00:00:38.850> water<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> mine<00:00:39.899> tailings<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the water with the mine tailings but

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
the water with the mine tailings but
also<00:00:40.739> they're<00:00:41.670> burning<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.629> separate

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
also they're burning it off to separate

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
also they're burning it off to separate
it<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> gold<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.120> it's<00:00:45.120> leaching<00:00:45.899> into

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it from the gold and it's leaching into

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.529 
it from the gold and it's leaching into
the<00:00:46.170> atmosphere<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.399> hangs<00:00:48.000> around<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the atmosphere and it hangs around for a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.990 
the atmosphere and it hangs around for a
long<00:00:48.750> long<00:00:49.079> time<00:00:49.280> generations<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.850> also

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
long long time generations and it also

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.189 
long long time generations and it also
travels<00:00:53.000> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.329> places<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.840> were<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.079> in

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
travels in the places that we were in in

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
travels in the places that we were in in
surinam<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.219> villages<00:00:56.850> indigenous

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
surinam there are villages indigenous

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.119 
surinam there are villages indigenous
villages<00:00:58.020> even<00:00:58.320> these<00:00:58.530> people<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.070> been

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
villages even these people have been

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
villages even these people have been
living<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> jungles<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.719> South<00:01:00.989> America

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
living in the jungles of South America

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.979 
living in the jungles of South America
for<00:01:01.789> they<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.180> long<00:01:03.359> generations

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
for they don't know how long generations

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.649 
for they don't know how long generations
but<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.129> problem<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.119> mercury

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
but the problem is is that the mercury

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
but the problem is is that the mercury
is<00:01:06.750> running<00:01:07.080> off<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> these<00:01:07.439> minds<00:01:07.920> into<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
is running off of these minds into the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.179 
is running off of these minds into the
water<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.229> becoming<00:01:10.229> methylated<00:01:11.040> which

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
water and becoming methylated which

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
water and becoming methylated which
means<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> through<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.420> natural<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
means that through a very natural and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
means that through a very natural and
organic<00:01:13.320> process<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.310> turns<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.180> something

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
organic process it turns into something

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.050 
organic process it turns into something
actually<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:16.080> toxic<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.909> gets

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
actually more toxic and then it gets

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
actually more toxic and then it gets
into<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.360> fish<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> fish<00:01:19.350> eat<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
into the fish you know the fish eat the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.530 
into the fish you know the fish eat the
plants<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.939> those<00:01:21.119> fish<00:01:21.390> are

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
plants and then you know those fish are

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880 
plants and then you know those fish are
eaten<00:01:21.750> by<00:01:21.810> bigger<00:01:22.080> fish<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.619> fish<00:01:22.830> are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
eaten by bigger fish and those fish are

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
eaten by bigger fish and those fish are
eaten<00:01:23.070> by<00:01:23.100> bigger<00:01:23.310> fish<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.299> lot<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
eaten by bigger fish and a lot of the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
eaten by bigger fish and a lot of the
aquatic<00:01:25.140> life<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> only<00:01:26.369> source

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
aquatic life is really the only source

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.319 
aquatic life is really the only source
of<00:01:27.119> protein<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.600> these<00:01:27.930> indigenous<00:01:28.380> villages

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
of protein for these indigenous villages

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.940 
of protein for these indigenous villages
it's<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.450> larger<00:01:30.990> problem<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> sense<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it's a larger problem in the sense that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
it's a larger problem in the sense that
the<00:01:32.220> fish<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.270> hang<00:01:33.420> around<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the fish don't just hang around the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.630 
the fish don't just hang around the
villages<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> gold<00:01:34.409> mines<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:35.280> can

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
villages or the gold mines they can

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
villages or the gold mines they can
travel<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:36.930> far<00:01:37.140> distance<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
travel you know very far distance is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.109 
travel you know very far distance is
almost<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> ocean<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
almost all the way down to the ocean and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.140 
almost all the way down to the ocean and
in<00:01:39.990> fact<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.380> earn<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> people<00:01:41.970> eat

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
in fact it's earn on a lot of people eat

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.609 
in fact it's earn on a lot of people eat
fish<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.990> rivers<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.640> chock-full<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.880> them

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.249 
looking at these folks in the indigenous
communities<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.490> had<00:02:02.520> any

found quite a few especially in the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
found quite a few especially in the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
children because mercury is particularly

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.520 
children because mercury is particularly

and unborn children it was an

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.180 
and unborn children it was an
interesting<00:02:17.170> experience<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.800> mean<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.100> not

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
interesting experience I mean it's not

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.380 
interesting experience I mean it's not
often<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.610> you're<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> place<00:02:19.180> where

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you're so completely isolated I mean we

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.850 
you're so completely isolated I mean we
had<00:02:21.580> satellite<00:02:21.970> phones<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:23.560> didn't<00:02:23.740> use

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
a while you can see mine cut out of it

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.360 
a while you can see mine cut out of it
and<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:57.430> landed<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.480> grass<00:02:59.080> runway<00:02:59.680> which

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
and we landed on a grass runway which

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.759 
and we landed on a grass runway which
was<00:03:01.000> really<00:03:01.330> short<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.350> plane<00:03:02.530> came

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
was really short and so the plane came

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.220 
was really short and so the plane came
down<00:03:03.060> smacked<00:03:04.060> into<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.420> ground<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.930> then

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
down smacked into the ground and then

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.460 
down smacked into the ground and then
put<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.800> brakes<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.430> was<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:07.470> hair-raising

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
put on the brakes it was a hair-raising

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.800 
put on the brakes it was a hair-raising
experience<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.370> then<00:03:09.519> once<00:03:10.120> we<00:03:10.330> land<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.630> this

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
experience and then once we land in this

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.449 
experience and then once we land in this
tiny<00:03:11.080> little<00:03:11.260> airstrip<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.860> actually<00:03:12.250> have

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
tiny little airstrip you actually have

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.490 
tiny little airstrip you actually have
to<00:03:12.700> go<00:03:12.850> further<00:03:13.180> downstream<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.110> get<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
to go further downstream to get to the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.949 
to go further downstream to get to the
actual<00:03:14.800> village<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.459> do<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.540> we<00:03:16.780> had<00:03:16.930> to

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
actual village and do that we had to

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.850 
actual village and do that we had to
drag<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.590> think<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.310> was<00:03:18.400> 25<00:03:19.180> cases<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:20.110> camera

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
drag I think it was 25 cases of camera

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.550 
drag I think it was 25 cases of camera
gear<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.430> medical<00:03:22.269> gear<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.870> all<00:03:23.230> sorts<00:03:23.530> of

other<00:03:23.680> stuff<00:03:23.950> food<00:03:24.190> we<00:03:24.430> had<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.610> bring

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
other stuff food we had to bring

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.270 
other stuff food we had to bring
everything<00:03:24.940> with<00:03:25.120> us<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.290> took<00:03:26.470> about<00:03:26.590> 15

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
everything with us and it took about 15

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640

chain and they more or less dragged us

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.250 
chain and they more or less dragged us
out<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.010> mud<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:38.490> we<00:04:39.120> got<00:04:39.240> out<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:40.080> was

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
doing this kind of mining at this point

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.670 
doing this kind of mining at this point
and<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:47.880> it's<00:04:48.660> got<00:04:48.840> its<00:04:49.140> got<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.320> real<00:04:49.500> global

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
and so it's got its got a real global

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.790 
and so it's got its got a real global
reach<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.340> its<00:04:50.820> number<00:04:51.210> one<00:04:51.680> contributor<00:04:52.680> of

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
reach and its number one contributor of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.190 
reach and its number one contributor of
mercury<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.880> environment<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:55.020> world

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
mercury to the environment in the world

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.840 
mercury to the environment in the world
it's<00:04:55.530> even<00:04:55.950> more<00:04:56.070> soul<00:04:56.310> than<00:04:56.340> than

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
it's even more soul than than

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.620 
it's even more soul than than
coal-burning<00:04:57.600> power<00:04:58.110> plants<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:59.760> again<00:05:00.419> that

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
coal-burning power plants and again that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.690 
coal-burning power plants and again that
that<00:05:01.500> stuff<00:05:01.710> moves<00:05:01.919> around<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.220> planet<00:05:02.580> and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
that stuff moves around the planet and

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.900 
that stuff moves around the planet and
so<00:05:03.330> yeah<00:05:03.690> it's<00:05:03.870> something<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.229> we<00:05:04.350> should

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
so yeah it's something that we should

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.200 
so yeah it's something that we should
you<00:05:05.910> know<00:05:06.000> be<00:05:06.030> aware<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.450> at<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.870> very<00:05:07.020> least
