decides to mine straight down using a
pork<00:01:56.219> chop<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:57.180> he<00:01:57.270> knows<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> not

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pork chop but he knows that this is not

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.639 
pork chop but he knows that this is not
the<00:01:58.170> best<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.280> uses<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.729> pickaxe

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
the best way so he uses a pickaxe

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.760 
the best way so he uses a pickaxe
instead<00:02:01.649> which<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> peculiar<00:02:03.270> choice<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
instead which is peculiar choice this is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.830 
instead which is peculiar choice this is
a<00:02:04.799> behavior<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.460> we've<00:02:05.640> seen<00:02:05.909> far<00:02:06.299> too<00:02:06.329> much

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
a behavior that we've seen far too much

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.839 
a behavior that we've seen far too much
with<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.200> noobs<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> seems<00:02:08.520> he's<00:02:08.670> run
