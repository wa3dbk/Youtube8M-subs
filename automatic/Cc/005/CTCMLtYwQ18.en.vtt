00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
that video you could just go back and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.820 
that video you could just go back and
watch<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.560> yeah<00:02:09.490> just

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
so I check it out spies slope let's get

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.440 
so I check it out spies slope let's get
back<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.320> this<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.830> can't<00:02:13.460> wait<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:13.850> see<00:02:14.270> this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
changed it like five different ways at

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.060 
changed it like five different ways at
it<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.780> all<00:02:29.960> blocks<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.380> arrange<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.860> into

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
it like all blocks and arrange it into

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.880 
it like all blocks and arrange it into
this<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.670> Vlad<00:02:31.910> round<00:02:32.270> circles<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.740> just

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
this so Vlad round circles so it's just

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.020 
this so Vlad round circles so it's just
like<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.250> whole<00:02:34.430> thing<00:02:34.610> took<00:02:34.760> me<00:02:34.910> like

like the whole thing took me like
forever<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.570> actually<00:02:35.810> build<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:36.830> I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
forever to actually build and but I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.410 
forever to actually build and but I

i<00:04:46.260> think<00:04:47.070> this<00:04:48.030> map<00:04:48.360> could<00:04:48.810> just<00:04:49.020> speak<00:04:49.200> to

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
i think this map could just speak to

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.990 
i think this map could just speak to
itself<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.950> mean<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.370> don't<00:04:50.520> even<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:50.910> to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
itself I mean I don't even have to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.640 
itself I mean I don't even have to
explain<00:04:51.330> how<00:04:51.570> much<00:04:51.750> destruction<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.470> there

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
this is like the most destruction we've

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.870 
this is like the most destruction we've
ever<00:05:06.570> got<00:05:06.810> from<00:05:06.990> one<00:05:07.320> map<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.890> think<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.610> have

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
ever got from one map I think I have

just<00:05:08.910> placed<00:05:09.570> those<00:05:09.840> sentence<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.500> very

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
just placed those sentence and very

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.469 
just placed those sentence and very
evenly<00:05:11.040> oldest<00:05:11.340> photo<00:05:11.580> column<00:05:11.940> it's<00:05:12.180> all<00:05:12.330> gone

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
I mean this is probably the most

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.230 
I mean this is probably the most
destruction<00:05:22.620> who<00:05:22.710> have<00:05:22.830> ever<00:05:23.040> had<00:05:23.669> from<00:05:24.000> any
