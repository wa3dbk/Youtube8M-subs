00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I'm just standing on a barrier I want to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
I'm just standing on a barrier I want to
do<00:01:11.909> something<00:01:12.240> else<00:01:12.360> well<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.560> to

do something else well you can get to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530 
do something else well you can get to
other<00:01:13.799> spots<00:01:14.220> basically<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.330> to

do is have two people straight and two
people<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.150> barrier<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.960> one

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
people get on this barrier then one

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.899 
people get on this barrier then one
person<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.159> spots<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> way

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
person can go to other spots and the way

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
person can go to other spots and the way
this<00:01:21.090> works<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> by<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.200> person<00:01:22.590> jumping

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this works is by that person jumping

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.399 
this works is by that person jumping
into<00:01:23.250> death<00:01:23.610> barriers<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.600> reviving<00:01:25.259> him

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
into death barriers and you reviving him

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.870 
into death barriers and you reviving him
so<00:01:25.590> he<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> death<00:01:26.490> berries

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so he can get through the death berries

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
so he can get through the death berries
and<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.360> beat<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> death<00:01:27.960> by<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.590> two

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and then beat the death by and get two

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
and then beat the death by and get two
points<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.430> death<00:01:29.640> berries<00:01:30.030> now

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
points that don't have death berries now

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030 
points that don't have death berries now
this<00:01:30.689> might<00:01:30.840> sound<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.170> complicated<00:01:31.590> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
this might sound a bit complicated but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.410 
this might sound a bit complicated but
I'm<00:01:32.159> sure<00:01:32.369> once<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> video

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
