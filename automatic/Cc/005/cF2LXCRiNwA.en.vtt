00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
one which will speed you off into that

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.130 
one which will speed you off into that
and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.910> one<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.300> teleport<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.900> over

and then that one we teleport you over
to<00:02:38.260> there<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.160> can<00:02:39.280> drop<00:02:39.400> down<00:02:39.580> get

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
to there and then you can drop down get

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.690 
to there and then you can drop down get
that<00:02:40.060> nerve<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:41.110> our<00:02:41.230> life<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:42.580> one

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
that nerve and get our life and that one

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.110 
that nerve and get our life and that one
just<00:02:42.850> requires<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.360> speed<00:02:43.660> thing<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:45.000> when<00:02:46.000> we

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
just requires a speed thing so when we

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.610 
just requires a speed thing so when we
come<00:02:46.300> back<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.600> back<00:02:46.750> track<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.170> level<00:02:47.350> we

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
come back to back track in this level we

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.620 
come back to back track in this level we
weren't<00:02:48.160> actually<00:02:48.310> backtrack<00:02:48.910> until<00:02:49.210> after

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
weren't actually backtrack until after

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.000 
weren't actually backtrack until after
we<00:02:49.690> completed<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.140> third<00:02:51.450> third<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:53.260> Arctic

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
we completed the third third the Arctic
