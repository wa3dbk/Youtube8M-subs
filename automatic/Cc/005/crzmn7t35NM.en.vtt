00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.210
 texture colors and come from much a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.340
 material that now patrician is going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.010

 little gifts that we have here of free channel 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 they have to send a text message to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.750
 0414 144 lipids during the work of the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.399
 program so that you can be 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.850
 some of the winners of that gift 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.989
 that we have here every day we work 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.989
 with locals 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.660
 and the materials to use in the channel 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.570
 around vintage style are going to be 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.960
 round tray of mdf white paint 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.900
 for the base cut out vintage style and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.759
 white tail simple materials that 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.800
 we can get to be the second 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.740
 part of our list of paintings of 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.649
 colors 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.950
 and start with the cases against brushes 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.590
 angular planes illuminators and stamps 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.329
 to decorate 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.479
 good are materials like you say 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:35.100
 simple first have technique the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.159
 Vintage technique is to restore them 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.229
 who are giving him equal it is true that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.420
 have damaged and the idea is then 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.770
 restore those same technique the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.920
 we are carrying this be what is the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.829
 wood they are using then papers 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.010
 that are old like cuts of 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.770
 truth newspaper in books 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.260
 and a range of roles that with all the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.910
 combined in those colors that we put 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.620
 there brown terra cottas not then 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.660
 well I brought it here is a step to 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.560
 step because I had the clear morning 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.320
 that we are going to be doing this far 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.850
 and there are all the papers the whole series 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.000
 of papers that are there are the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.030
 butterflies of all those be in that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.550
 click what we are going to be selling in 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 the store although they do not complicate everything 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.470
 not so good and I'm going to start 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.010
 paste and this really needs a 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.220
 technique because I will after them 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.590
 design what is in general with all 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.180
 the sheets and with all the papers what 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.880
 Of course it will combine something that goes 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
 accompanied what is the visited 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.970
 there should always be a number one paper 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.770
 a paper number two because then I 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.500
 I will go removing any below and 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.730
 anyone clear although we need it 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.090
 scissors we're going to tear because 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.849
 the paper looks nice there are several 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.030
 that are there in the box but I would like 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.190
 that they also saw in the picture and this 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.140
 so beautiful project that brought them here 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.769
 you will also use photos of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.989
 magazines can but good always 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.200
 let's say of that tonic of old things of 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.629
 restoration and then it's a technique 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.120
 that you are seeing that I am told that 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.209
 is in patience mode and in the 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.920
 bags and then well the trap what 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.560
 we move to what is the technique of 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.099
 painting about what is a little bit for 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.459
 innovate always does not have to be everything 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.019
 painted I'm stuck right now with 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.990
 a product with the same one that the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.000
 napkins 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.000
 and look good can have a payment 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.709
 a wipe to go very well 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.750
 but as I told you any questions or 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.700
 any material that he needs with 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.519
 very much taste can approach the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.010
 Patricia shop learn a little more 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.599
 of these techniques because not only what 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.519
 that we see here but sometimes one wants 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.940
 enjoy the different moment 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.379
 share with a group afterwards what 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.840
 that we give here with a lot of love 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.630
 that suddenly you can spend the day 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.519
 learning clear more by asking and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.870
 discovering good we all have that 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.030
 possibility of doing beautiful things 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.090
 clear and proven how good they want 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.190
 that the one exactly like the one 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.229
 I have designed work and what I want 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.600
 see with this is that it is very easy 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.930
 look say it with what in a way 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.930
 irregular 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.629
 then I prepared that and how are they 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.419
 designed the flags and there is 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.830
 there is also what is the design of 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.790
 the flag 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.940
 We take a picture of each chest in 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.420
 particularly the design of the sea chest and 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.420
 air 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.470
 all that you want it 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.270
 have banderillas for sale can 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.420
 communicate with ya directly goes to 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.450
 approaching is going up and good to start 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.660
 to explore this beautiful world of 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.150
 Dealing with the technique 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.290
 that seems to me particularly 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.280
 interesting because maybe you have a 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.750
 furniture well 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.430
 miguelito in the house a chest some 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.000
 piece looks spectacular if you do not forget 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.670
 of sanding first the whole piece 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.260
 and then they're going to put it in it 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.690
 design 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.260
 there are some who have that technique of 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.260
 decor 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.400
 look you are going to be designing 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.160
 true that any design is clean 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.840
 behind an advance and the pieces do not 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.170
 they are using them for others too 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.500
 can go useful do not make us lose anyone 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.080
 now a distance and I have a point 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.200
 of meeting ok then I also want 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.480
 that for example if some papers that 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.870
 they are blank because it can be a 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.870
 copy 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.810
 then we will try to give it a tone 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.990
 water money in the rest nothing 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.270
 let's use an aged mustard and 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.270
 we passed a wand of that color 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.600
 Let's also say that it is going to 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.040
 help how to learn and put a 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 little else is the world of painting 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.800
 that a lot of people have a bit of 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.620
 fear then notice that about those 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.180
 pieces 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.520
 they can start to put the little touches 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.110
 of paintings and they get used where 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.660
 think people who are like 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.850
 exploring a little those attitudes that 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.590
 we all have then here started to 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.460
 burn 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.760
 and in that burnt sensation of the role of 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.580
 I touched 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.150
 is more aguadito than what is painting in 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.420
 reality 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.560
 clear because it is simply this 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.560
 deserved this subject 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.520
 in all that are the crosses of the 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.520
 papers 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:20.970
 highlighting more this is to give texture 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.850
 just like you said the paper and 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:30.210
 highlights a little more in the work of 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:33.770
 other workshops that we already did and 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:37.979
 good our basic courses that 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.979
 we have always had and also wanted 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.800
 announce how good I'm going to travel to 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:44.120
 come forward 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.250
 the first city I'm going to visit 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.129
 then in fairy tales that wait 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.530
 in friends for wheels is very 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:53.900
 pending there they communicate with patricia 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.909
 so they can enjoy and learn 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.310
 so they do not say we're not going 

00:07:55.909 --> 00:08:00.409
 never for her I do not know whether to call the 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:06.159
 store 

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:06.159
 we are going to have them we are working
