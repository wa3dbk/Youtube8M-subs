00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.939
 hello girls this is Masha after my 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.070
 Hollywood manicure video to me in PM 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.589
 began to receive requests to tell 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.509
 More about the slider design how to make 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.910
 so that the tapes do not hold tight 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.919
 flew off on the third or fourth day and how 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.750
 In general, they are properly glued to gel polish with 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.300
 pleasure in this video will show you 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.730
 how i do it i won't paint everything 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.009
 nails just make a slider design and on 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.199
 2 who suffered after cleaning 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.669
 Potatoes this is probably only I can beat 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.279
 two nails in one fell swoop 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.140
 I will tell you in secret I do not take off 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.149
 gel polish not only because manicure 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.980
 still relatively fresh mostly 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.750
 because I am testing a new one for myself 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.360
 fox gel polish 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.160
 actually now we will not tell shade in 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.379
 review which will be next week 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.690
 in fact, I already have something about him 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.120
 say so watch my videos 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.890
 wait for new products and write in the comments 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.629
 if you also have something to say about this 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.579
 things go to design 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.829
 there are many varieties 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.899
 These sliders are not new 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.219
 I think you are all familiar with them and in this 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.649
 video we will not make out 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.180
 varieties such design i use 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.799
 here is such a stupid me 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.320
 bins home of the snake inside 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.420
 this slider design without glue i mean it 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.820
 not self adhesive to separate 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.799
 film from paper backing us 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.960
 need water most problems with 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.119
 slides occur if you do this 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 slider design on the entire nail plate 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.020
 so today we will do exactly 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 such a design if you do 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.649
 slider design on the entire nail plate 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.649
 the first thing you need to do is 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.360
 cut the nail shape sticker and 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.610
 I recommend to do it as accurately as possible. 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.530
 Of course you can align the shape of the sticker 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.840
 already after we posted it on 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.270
 nails are done with scissors 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.830
 but still much simpler and neater 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.810
 first cut and then glue 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.240
 most of these stickers are made on 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.750
 transparent film in this case to us 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.220
 need to make a foundation of white gel polish 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.009
 thanks to her the end result 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.810
 will be bright saturated bakes white 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.360
 substrate is not necessary in that case 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.670
 if your chosen design is black 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.220
 patterns for example or foil 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.379
 slider design alternatives to white color 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.619
 may be some kind of light camouflage 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.619
 house 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.480
 Now we apply gel varnish as usual very 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.710
 detailed technology of applying gel varnish 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.710
 here in this video 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.120
 while I am preparing nails 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 slider design lies on wet wipes 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.540
 i use white color code number 24 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.190
 the final stage of our training sleigh 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.130
 in top with a sticky layer 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.690
 impose a thin layer of dry but not 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.690
 remove the sticky layer 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.950
 little trick wanting to cover 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.900
 slider design smile french don't dry 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.030
 top before applying film 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.290
 transferring the design to your wet top 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.980
 will be able to adjust 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.269
 position sliders smile line and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.900
 asymmetry without breaking and stretching 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.519
 . 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 then understand what to insist on 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.970
 place to dry and so you can do not 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.069
 only with jacket 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.780
 I have this method convenient and I them 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.519
 always use now let's 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.890
 We will understand why we deploy 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.230
 slumber design on wet wipes many 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.690
 dunk his water deeper as if 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.599
 influences something and then gets it 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.909
 there and well if we explain with tweezers 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.920
 working with gel varnish water we are now no 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.409
 what is the use of our application all 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.810
 improvised funds year we have to 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.519
 I wipe the minimum with a sticker and then 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.650
 still not special, this juice soaks 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.170
 and in the process we risk memory or 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.329
 bend the sticker if the slider design lay 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.239
 on wet napkins there leg soaked a 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.639
 the film has remained dry and slipping off 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.920
 pieces of paper are very easy and simple outfit by 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.349
 flowers water for plenochka then it all 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.060
 wipe too no need for shorter 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.709
 less extra telavi 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.080
 and by the way, with paper too nothing 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.540
 runs off not dripping and we are very comfortable 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.420
 transfer the design to someone more comfortable with tweezers 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.819
 please soft orange pusher 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.709
 chopsticks or like me sometimes napkin 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.510
 We are helping our plenochki rovnenko 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.250
 accommodate on yesterday but smooth everything 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.739
 bumps and folds 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.349
 if other tabs that you donâ€™t 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.880
 manages to smooth cut them a little 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.190
 and they will breed easily 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.190
 pay attention to how I applied 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.840
 do 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.310
 with a big island so he doesn't 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.540
 peeking out sparta site 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.120
 with the same purpose can be used 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.850
 bright camouflage house for all new 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.370
 transferring the slide to the nail plate design 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.160
 pull back a little more from the cuticle and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.140
 side rollers to end 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.180
 could seal our design with all 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.460
 sides when we smoothed out all the folds 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.830
 in front of the squirrel for natural nails 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.530
 perfect if it's a glass file and 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.480
 grind off the excess here it is desirable to whittle 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.920
 half a millimeter polish to better 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.010
 seal the end of the nail 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.200
 caught or overlapping top two times this 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.780
 I will definitely tell you one more 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.210
 a little trick if it happened 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.220
 so the sticker is bumpy any 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.060
 tubercle in place of the folds or else 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.430
 anything 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.040
 overlap the design first at the base for 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.930
 This is better suited dense base more dangerous 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.780
 top slider design is best 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.430
 worn on tops from the company Cindy but I 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.500
 I use copies and I have everything 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.020
 Remarkably keeps showing how I 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.660
 I seal the design put a small 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.360
 point tops a couple millimeters from the cuticle 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.730
 then I move this droplet with a brush 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.520
 I look upwards beyond the limits of design and 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.460
 returning to the bottom of the tip now by 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.140
 same principle pushing gel polish with a brush 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.210
 I pass on the raw edge near 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.699
 cuticle 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.880
 down along the side rollers sealing 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.880
 until 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.879
 now sealed end free edge 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.339
 remove the sticky layer with a clinser set me 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.499
 Huskies show the video to her friends and
