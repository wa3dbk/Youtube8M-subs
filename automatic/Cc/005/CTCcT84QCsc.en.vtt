than<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> did<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> other<00:01:44.040> ones<00:01:44.370> it<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.060> seemed

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
than I did the other ones it just seemed

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
than I did the other ones it just seemed
like<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.420> were<00:01:45.480> putting<00:01:45.870> in<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.290> jokes<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
like they were putting in more jokes and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.680 
like they were putting in more jokes and
more<00:01:47.160> fourth-wall<00:01:47.670> humour<00:01:48.120> but<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.570> one

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
more fourth-wall humour but the one

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.390 
more fourth-wall humour but the one
question<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.200> did<00:01:49.410> constantly<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> ask

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
question you did constantly have to ask

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.370 
question you did constantly have to ask
yourself<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> did<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.510> work<00:01:51.780> better<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
yourself is did this work better as a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.160 
yourself is did this work better as a
half-hour<00:01:52.920> short<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.820> personally<00:01:54.450> yeah<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
half-hour short and personally yeah I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.260 
half-hour short and personally yeah I
think<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.830> sort<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> did<00:01:56.310> something<00:01:57.060> about

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
think it sort of did something about

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.820 
think it sort of did something about
squeezing<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.990> into<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.320> short<00:01:58.590> amount<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
squeezing it into this short amount of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.130 
squeezing it into this short amount of
time<00:01:59.000> strangely<00:02:00.000> enough<00:02:00.240> made<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.720> seem<00:02:00.960> more

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
time strangely enough made it seem more

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.590 
time strangely enough made it seem more
large<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.770> epic<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.610> villains<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.210> remember

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
large and epic the villains I remember

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
large and epic the villains I remember
being<00:02:03.750> especially<00:02:04.260> threatening<00:02:04.980> from<00:02:05.160> those

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
being especially threatening from those

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.250 
being especially threatening from those
shorts<00:02:05.730> and<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.330> one<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.810> sort<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
shorts and this one is just sort of a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.190 
shorts and this one is just sort of a
pompous<00:02:07.830> ray<00:02:08.190> vines<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.509> sort<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.840> like

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
pompous ray vines is just sort of like

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
pompous ray vines is just sort of like
the<00:02:10.590> typical<00:02:11.099> show-off<00:02:11.879> jerk<00:02:12.420> who<00:02:12.660> doesn't

the typical show-off jerk who doesn't

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.960 
the typical show-off jerk who doesn't
get<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> joke<00:02:13.769> yeah<00:02:14.220> there's<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.550> much<00:02:14.760> to

him

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.479 
him
maybe<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> shorts<00:02:16.620> were<00:02:16.829> kind<00:02:17.219> of<00:02:17.340> on

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
maybe because the shorts were kind of on

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.339 
maybe because the shorts were kind of on
a<00:02:17.519> smaller<00:02:17.939> scale<00:02:18.359> you<00:02:18.420> were<00:02:18.719> more<00:02:18.870> impressed

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
a smaller scale you were more impressed

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.690 
a smaller scale you were more impressed
when<00:02:19.530> they<00:02:19.650> did<00:02:19.799> something<00:02:20.040> legitimately

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
when they did something legitimately

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.660 
when they did something legitimately
large

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
large

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
large
in<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.150> movie<00:02:22.480> you're<00:02:22.690> already<00:02:23.050> sort<00:02:23.290> of

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
in a movie you're already sort of

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.470 
in a movie you're already sort of
expecting<00:02:23.860> something<00:02:24.099> large<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.180> doesn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
expecting something large so it doesn't

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.180 
expecting something large so it doesn't
really<00:02:25.660> surprise<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:27.010> sort<00:02:27.160> of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
really surprise you it just sort of

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.339 
really surprise you it just sort of
gives<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.700> you're<00:02:27.849> expecting<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:29.020> if

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
gives you what you're expecting but if

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.470 
gives you what you're expecting but if
what<00:02:29.680> you're<00:02:29.770> expecting<00:02:30.280> isn't<00:02:30.580> bad<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:31.239> me

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
what you're expecting isn't bad like me

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.540 
what you're expecting isn't bad like me
then<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.410> movie<00:02:32.709> isn't<00:02:32.860> really<00:02:33.160> bad<00:02:33.340> either

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
then this movie isn't really bad either

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.059 
then this movie isn't really bad either
it's<00:02:34.090> still<00:02:34.360> wallace<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.020> gromit<00:02:35.050> it's<00:02:35.709> still

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
it's still wallace and gromit it's still

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.130 
it's still wallace and gromit it's still
the<00:02:36.310> same<00:02:36.520> characters<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.480> still<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.959> same

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
the same characters it's still the same

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.500 
the same characters it's still the same
circumstances<00:02:38.950> they<00:02:39.099> usually<00:02:39.250> get<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.150> just

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
circumstances they usually get in I just

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.880 
circumstances they usually get in I just
think<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.930> might<00:02:41.080> have<00:02:41.230> worked<00:02:41.349> better<00:02:41.560> if<00:02:41.769> it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
think it might have worked better if it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.250 
think it might have worked better if it
was<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.220> half-hour<00:02:42.550> short<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:43.989> what<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
was in a half-hour short but for what it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.410 
was in a half-hour short but for what it
is<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.890> fun<00:02:45.099> little<00:02:45.250> movie<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.910> can't

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
is it's a fun little movie I can't

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
is it's a fun little movie I can't
really<00:02:46.510> say<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.050> solution<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.680> make<00:02:48.010> it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
really say if the solution is make it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.180 
really say if the solution is make it
smaller<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:49.030> make<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.480> bigger<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.950> don't

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
smaller or make it bigger but it's don't

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.370 
smaller or make it bigger but it's don't
like<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:52.030> kind<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.330> hard<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.810> dislike

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
like it it's kind of hard to dislike

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.259 
like it it's kind of hard to dislike
something<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.950> innocent<00:02:54.190> as<00:02:54.670> wallace<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
something as innocent as wallace and

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.390 
something as innocent as wallace and
gromit<00:02:55.299> it's<00:02:56.290> not<00:02:56.440> motion<00:02:56.769> animation<00:02:57.130> is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
gromit it's not motion animation is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.460 
gromit it's not motion animation is
always<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.819> spectacular<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:59.110> sets<00:02:59.350> are

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
always a spectacular the sets are

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.110 
always a spectacular the sets are
probably<00:02:59.950> among<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> biggest<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
probably among the biggest that the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.059 
probably among the biggest that the
studio<00:03:01.420> has<00:03:01.600> ever<00:03:01.720> done<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.680> still<00:03:02.890> has

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
studio has ever done and it still has

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.009 
studio has ever done and it still has
two<00:03:03.310> characters<00:03:03.790> we<00:03:03.970> really<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.540> being<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
two characters we really like being the

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.140 
two characters we really like being the
two<00:03:05.200> characters<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:05.890> really<00:03:06.190> like<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.730> can't

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
two characters we really like I can't

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.370 
two characters we really like I can't
say<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.450> strongest<00:03:07.780> out<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.200> what

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
say it's the strongest out of what

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.930 
say it's the strongest out of what
wallets<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.830> from<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.099> have<00:03:09.250> done<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:09.910> I

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
wallets and from it have done but I

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.880 
wallets and from it have done but I
still<00:03:10.239> think<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.540> pretty<00:03:10.750> likable<00:03:11.019> if<00:03:11.709> you're

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
still think is pretty likable if you're

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.860 
still think is pretty likable if you're
