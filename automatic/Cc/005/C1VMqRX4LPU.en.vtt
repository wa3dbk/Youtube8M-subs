motion<00:01:16.850> dampening<00:01:24.400> here<00:01:25.400> we're<00:01:25.610> back<00:01:25.760> to<00:01:25.910> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
motion dampening here we're back to the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.520 
motion dampening here we're back to the
Steadicam<00:01:26.710> it's<00:01:27.710> got<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> much<00:01:28.520> smoother<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
Steadicam it's got a much smoother and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.859 
Steadicam it's got a much smoother and
fluid<00:01:30.530> floating<00:01:31.190> feeling<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.850> lot<00:01:32.660> less

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
fluid floating feeling a lot less

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:52.200 
fluid floating feeling a lot less
jittery<00:01:33.350> than<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.860> hard<00:01:34.700> mounted<00:01:35.119> grip

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.250 

I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:55.180> it's<00:01:55.299> important<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.840> remember<00:01:56.110> that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
I think it's important to remember that

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.280 
I think it's important to remember that
a<00:01:56.500> steadycam<00:01:57.070> is<00:01:57.310> not<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.549> magic<00:01:58.150> solution<00:01:58.390> for

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
a steadycam is not a magic solution for

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.350 
a steadycam is not a magic solution for
smooth<00:01:59.830> shots

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
smooth shots

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600 
smooth shots
you<00:02:01.780> still<00:02:02.050> need<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.440> hold<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.100> as<00:02:03.220> steady<00:02:03.460> as

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
you still need to hold it as steady as

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.309 
you still need to hold it as steady as
possible<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.810> walk<00:02:05.110> smoothly<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.319> should

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
possible and walk smoothly you should

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.770 
possible and walk smoothly you should
practice<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.220> little<00:02:09.759> bit<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.690> you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
practice a little bit with it so you

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.130 
practice a little bit with it so you
know<00:02:10.929> how<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.200> use<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.590> well<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:13.030> that's<00:02:13.959> about

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
know how to use it well and that's about

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.400 
know how to use it well and that's about
it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.260
