00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
this is my review of the all-new Black &amp;

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.400 
this is my review of the all-new Black &amp;
Decker<00:00:04.710> air<00:00:05.430> station<00:00:06.180> AS<00:00:07.760> 1500<00:00:08.780> it's<00:00:09.780> a

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
Decker air station AS 1500 it's a

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.830 
Decker air station AS 1500 it's a
cordless<00:00:10.769> air<00:00:11.280> station<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.660> is

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
cordless air station and this is

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.740 
cordless air station and this is
everything<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.230> comes<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> box<00:00:14.599> you<00:00:15.599> get

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
everything that comes in the box you get

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
everything that comes in the box you get
a<00:00:15.780> wall<00:00:16.500> charger<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:18.830> get<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.100> owner's<00:00:20.730> manual

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a wall charger I get the owner's manual

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.500 
a wall charger I get the owner's manual
and<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> box<00:00:25.250> as<00:00:26.250> well<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> unit<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and the box as well as the unit here and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
and the box as well as the unit here and
the<00:00:27.930> unit<00:00:28.849> actually<00:00:29.849> has<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.750> few<00:00:31.710> attachments

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the unit actually has a few attachments

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.319 
the unit actually has a few attachments
that<00:00:32.369> come<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.590> looks<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:35.239> possibly<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that come with it looks like possibly a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
that come with it looks like possibly a
pump<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> ball<00:00:39.710> another<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:43.610> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> end

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
pump for a ball another one on the end

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.840 
pump for a ball another one on the end
is<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.860> bigger<00:00:46.860> size<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is just a bigger size and the thing I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.680 
is just a bigger size and the thing I
like<00:00:51.030> best<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.640> everything's

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
like best about this is everything's

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
like best about this is everything's
color-coordinated<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> blue

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
color-coordinated so it's got a blue

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760 
color-coordinated so it's got a blue
side<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.090> green<00:00:57.329> side<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
side and a green side so when you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.540 
side and a green side so when you
actually<00:00:58.890> flip<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> switch<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.030> turn<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> on

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
actually flip the switch to turn it on

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.539 
actually flip the switch to turn it on
the<00:01:02.750> indicator<00:01:03.750> lights<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> push<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the indicator lights up and you push it

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.560 
the indicator lights up and you push it
towards<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> green<00:01:06.240> side<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:08.420> don't<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.479> if

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
towards the green side I don't know if

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
towards the green side I don't know if
you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.760> yeah<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you can see that but yeah it's got a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.070 
you can see that but yeah it's got a
green<00:01:15.020> color-coordinated<00:01:16.020> button<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> then

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
green color-coordinated button and then

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.609 
green color-coordinated button and then
the<00:01:19.080> colors<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> attachments<00:01:21.619> also

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the colors of the attachments also

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.300 
the colors of the attachments also
correspond<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:24.650> what<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.830> using<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> for

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
correspond with what you're using it for

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.390 
correspond with what you're using it for
so<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.790> you're<00:01:26.880> doing<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> bike<00:01:27.330> tire<00:01:28.009> car<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so if you're doing a bike tire car a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.590 
so if you're doing a bike tire car a
ball<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:31.229> vehicle<00:01:32.090> it's<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
ball or your vehicle it's all on the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.819 
ball or your vehicle it's all on the
green<00:01:33.780> side<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:36.470> you're<00:01:37.470> using<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> green

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
green side and you're using the green

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.609 
green side and you're using the green
green<00:01:40.829> pump<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.229> that's<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
green pump for that so that's kind of a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.090 
green pump for that so that's kind of a
brief<00:01:43.829> overview<00:01:45.140> one<00:01:46.140> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> cool<00:01:46.829> feature

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
brief overview one kind of cool feature

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.830 
brief overview one kind of cool feature
about<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> actually<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> best

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
about this that I actually like the best

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.670 
about this that I actually like the best
is<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> turn<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> unit<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
is that when you turn the unit on and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.020 
is that when you turn the unit on and
you<00:01:52.680> attach<00:01:53.299> this<00:01:54.299> nozzle<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.290> say<00:01:56.219> your<00:01:56.520> car

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you attach this nozzle to say your car

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
you attach this nozzle to say your car
or<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.649> ball<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:58.920> bicycle<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.770> tells

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
or a ball or bicycle it actually tells

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.910 
or a ball or bicycle it actually tells
you<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.549> pressure<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.570> screen

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
you what the pressure is on the screen

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.469 
you what the pressure is on the screen
so<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.250> need<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> separate<00:02:06.149> device

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so there's no need for a separate device

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.710 
so there's no need for a separate device
to<00:02:06.899> tell<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.729> what<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> tire<00:02:09.060> pressure<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to tell you what the tire pressure is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.559 
to tell you what the tire pressure is
and<00:02:10.080> pump<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.160> stop

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
and pump it up stop

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.589 
and pump it up stop
the<00:02:12.689> pressure<00:02:12.930> keep<00:02:13.829> pumping<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.579> do<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.269> so

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
the pressure keep pumping and do that so

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.229 
the pressure keep pumping and do that so
it<00:02:15.719> saves<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.049> lot<00:02:16.079> of<00:02:16.230> time<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.879> other<00:02:18.000> thing

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
it saves a lot of time the other thing

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.170 
it saves a lot of time the other thing
which<00:02:18.359> I'll<00:02:18.510> show<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.909> you<00:02:20.909> can<00:02:21.090> actually

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
which I'll show you is you can actually

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.830 
which I'll show you is you can actually
set<00:02:21.629> what<00:02:22.049> tire<00:02:22.620> pressure<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.549> want<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.569> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
set what tire pressure you want it to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.740 
set what tire pressure you want it to
stop<00:02:25.109> at<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.769> if<00:02:25.859> I<00:02:25.950> plugged<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:26.700> stop<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.239> 35

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
stop at so if I plugged in to stop at 35

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.550 
stop at so if I plugged in to stop at 35
psi<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:29.939> run<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.900> walk<00:02:31.079> away<00:02:31.290> do

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
psi it will run I can walk away do

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.410 
psi it will run I can walk away do
whatever<00:02:31.769> I'm<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.159> do<00:02:32.280> come<00:02:32.670> back<00:02:32.879> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
whatever I'm going to do come back and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.960 
whatever I'm going to do come back and
it<00:02:33.540> shuts<00:02:33.840> itself<00:02:34.200> off<00:02:34.470> when<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:35.280> reaches<00:02:35.640> 35

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
it shuts itself off when it reaches 35

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.580 
it shuts itself off when it reaches 35
psi<00:02:36.829> so<00:02:37.829> I<00:02:38.159> will<00:02:38.849> get<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:39.780> thing<00:02:39.840> charged<00:02:40.379> up

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
psi so I will get this thing charged up

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.899 
psi so I will get this thing charged up
and<00:02:40.939> we'll<00:02:41.939> show<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.150> how<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.420> works<00:02:43.909> all

that's<00:04:26.910> one<00:04:27.150> thing<00:04:27.419> that<00:04:27.449> I<00:04:27.600> really<00:04:27.990> don't

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
that's one thing that I really don't

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.189 
that's one thing that I really don't
care<00:04:28.680> for<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.840> seems<00:04:30.840> like<00:04:30.930> you

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
care for and this is it seems like you

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.040 
care for and this is it seems like you
lose<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.820> decent<00:04:32.820> amount<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.120> error<00:04:33.419> when<00:04:34.020> you

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
lose a decent amount of error when you

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.450 
lose a decent amount of error when you
take<00:04:34.289> it<00:04:34.470> out<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.710> kind<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:34.949> takes<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.280> little

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
take it out it kind of takes a little

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.279 
take it out it kind of takes a little
getting<00:04:35.580> used<00:04:36.000> to

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
getting used to

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.210 
getting used to
and<00:04:38.750> another<00:04:39.750> cool<00:04:40.020> feature<00:04:40.199> found<00:04:40.889> on<00:04:41.039> this

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
and another cool feature found on this

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.689 
and another cool feature found on this
is<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.490> actually<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.820> an<00:04:41.910> LED<00:04:42.240> light<00:04:43.580> if<00:04:44.580> you

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
is it actually is an LED light if you

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.310 
is it actually is an LED light if you
can<00:04:44.880> see<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.600> it's<00:04:45.840> actually<00:04:46.139> pretty

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
can see that and it's actually pretty

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.450 
can see that and it's actually pretty
bright<00:04:46.650> works<00:04:47.490> pretty<00:04:47.699> well<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:49.320> far

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
bright works pretty well so far

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.050 
bright works pretty well so far
really<00:04:51.120> liking<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:52.590> no<00:04:53.220> complaints<00:04:53.880> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
really liking it no complaints the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.659 
really liking it no complaints the
charge<00:04:54.300> times<00:04:54.660> are<00:04:54.870> pretty<00:04:54.990> quick<00:04:55.460> say<00:04:56.460> within

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
charge times are pretty quick say within

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.890 
charge times are pretty quick say within
probably<00:04:57.180> an<00:04:57.479> hour<00:04:58.039> after<00:04:59.039> pumping<00:04:59.460> up<00:04:59.900> two

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
probably an hour after pumping up two

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.340 
probably an hour after pumping up two
cars<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.580> eight<00:05:02.880> tires<00:05:03.180> there<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.870> then<00:05:04.050> maybe

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
cars so eight tires there and then maybe

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.100 
cars so eight tires there and then maybe
another<00:05:04.820> bicycle<00:05:05.820> or<00:05:05.970> two<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.690> know<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.900> takes

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
another bicycle or two you know it takes

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.550 
another bicycle or two you know it takes
an<00:05:07.470> hour<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:08.160> charge<00:05:08.400> up<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.760> unit<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:10.380> also

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
an hour to to charge up the unit it also

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.670 
an hour to to charge up the unit it also
has<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:14.270> charger<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.660> plug<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:15.990> into<00:05:16.110> your<00:05:16.410> car

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
has a charger to plug it into your car

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.040
