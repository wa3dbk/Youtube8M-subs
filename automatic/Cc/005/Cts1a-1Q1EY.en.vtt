00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
just attach them onto earrings but I

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.580 
just attach them onto earrings but I
didn't<00:00:44.030> consider<00:00:44.330> them<00:00:44.600> like<00:00:45.050> making<00:00:45.440> them

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
didn't consider them like making them

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.320 
didn't consider them like making them
myself<00:00:45.739> because<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:46.280> took<00:00:46.370> about<00:00:46.520> two<00:00:46.880> seconds

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
myself because it took about two seconds

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.350 
myself because it took about two seconds
all<00:00:47.510> I<00:00:47.540> did<00:00:47.780> was<00:00:47.810> attack<00:00:48.080> this<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.790> didn't

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
all I did was attack this so I didn't

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.729 
all I did was attack this so I didn't
think<00:00:50.450> it<00:00:50.600> was<00:00:50.660> being<00:00:50.900> obnoxious<00:00:51.440> putting

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
think it was being obnoxious putting

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.350 
think it was being obnoxious putting
them<00:00:51.890> in<00:00:52.040> but<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.489> read<00:00:52.700> these<00:00:52.850> all<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.330> time

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
them in but I read these all the time

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.810 
them in but I read these all the time
just<00:00:53.809> as<00:00:54.020> everyday<00:00:54.350> earrings<00:00:54.680> because<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.370> love

they're not unicorns because they don't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.500

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
of rings so I guess this one's my

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.550 
of rings so I guess this one's my
favorite<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.930> don't<00:04:44.169> feel<00:04:44.290> super
