build him a bike rack and this is the
bike<00:05:26.420> rack<00:05:26.660> that<00:05:26.690> I<00:05:26.900> completed<00:05:27.760> he<00:05:28.760> wanted

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
bike rack that I completed he wanted

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.290 
bike rack that I completed he wanted
seven<00:05:29.690> slots<00:05:29.990> for<00:05:30.710> he's<00:05:31.670> planning<00:05:32.030> on<00:05:32.120> having

each pair of uprights is two-and-a-half

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.390 
each pair of uprights is two-and-a-half
inches<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:50.330> risers<00:05:50.720> are<00:05:50.900> 28<00:05:51.320> inches<00:05:51.650> the

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
inches the risers are 28 inches the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.320 
inches the risers are 28 inches the
overall<00:05:52.760> length<00:05:52.970> is<00:05:53.560> 10<00:05:54.560> feet<00:05:55.090> there's<00:05:56.090> six

last set of uprights there is an angled
piece<00:06:01.400> there<00:06:01.640> if<00:06:01.730> you<00:06:01.850> look<00:06:01.970> at<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:03.020> help

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
piece there if you look at that to help

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.150 
piece there if you look at that to help
give<00:06:03.890> stability<00:06:04.130> to<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:04.760> top<00:06:05.050> that<00:06:06.050> top<00:06:06.860> sign

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
give stability to the top that top sign

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.250 
give stability to the top that top sign
I<00:06:07.190> cut<00:06:07.520> out<00:06:07.550> on<00:06:07.910> my<00:06:08.030> CNC<00:06:08.420> machine<00:06:08.750> with<00:06:08.930> about

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
I cut out on my CNC machine with about

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.920 
I cut out on my CNC machine with about
10<00:06:09.680> it's<00:06:10.130> 10<00:06:10.310> or<00:06:10.430> 11<00:06:10.670> gauge<00:06:10.850> material<00:06:11.480> about

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
10 it's 10 or 11 gauge material about

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.770 
10 it's 10 or 11 gauge material about
1/8<00:06:12.140> inch<00:06:12.170> and<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:14.000> figured<00:06:14.420> I<00:06:14.510> might<00:06:14.630> as<00:06:14.750> well

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
1/8 inch and I figured I might as well

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.250 
1/8 inch and I figured I might as well
add<00:06:15.050> that<00:06:15.260> on<00:06:15.440> there<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:16.000> this<00:06:17.000> final<00:06:17.480> piece

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
add that on there and this final piece

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.770 
add that on there and this final piece
of<00:06:18.290> bar<00:06:18.980> out<00:06:19.250> here<00:06:19.310> what<00:06:20.090> that<00:06:20.240> does<00:06:20.480> is<00:06:20.630> it

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
of bar out here what that does is it

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.990 
of bar out here what that does is it
forces<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.620> wheels<00:06:21.800> to<00:06:22.070> stay<00:06:22.250> forward<00:06:22.580> into

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
forces the wheels to stay forward into

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.570 
forces the wheels to stay forward into
the<00:06:23.350> uprights<00:06:24.350> and<00:06:24.970> I<00:06:25.970> measured<00:06:26.750> that<00:06:27.020> I<00:06:27.580> know

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
the uprights and I measured that I know

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.740 
the uprights and I measured that I know
somebody's<00:06:29.090> going<00:06:29.300> to<00:06:29.360> ask<00:06:29.570> me<00:06:29.720> that

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
somebody's going to ask me that

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.090 
somebody's going to ask me that
measurement<00:06:30.200> so<00:06:30.440> let<00:06:30.560> me<00:06:30.650> go<00:06:30.740> ahead<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:30.980> get

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
measurement so let me go ahead and get

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.950 
measurement so let me go ahead and get
it<00:06:31.190> this<00:06:31.520> is<00:06:31.700> 20<00:06:31.970> inches<00:06:32.120> from<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.480> back<00:06:32.660> here

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
it this is 20 inches from the back here

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.190 
it this is 20 inches from the back here

maybe<00:06:44.150> 1/16<00:06:44.780> shy<00:06:45.020> that<00:06:45.320> would<00:06:45.500> call<00:06:45.680> 8<00:06:45.890> and<00:06:46.040> 5/8

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
maybe 1/16 shy that would call 8 and 5/8

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.320 
maybe 1/16 shy that would call 8 and 5/8
eight<00:06:47.980> and<00:06:48.070> five-eighths<00:06:48.460> little<00:06:48.790> short<00:06:49.030> so

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
eight and five-eighths little short so

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.410 
eight and five-eighths little short so
at<00:06:49.600> 1/16<00:06:50.230> that<00:06:50.530> so<00:06:50.770> anyway<00:06:51.070> I<00:06:51.280> just<00:06:51.790> was

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
at 1/16 that so anyway I just was

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.720 
at 1/16 that so anyway I just was
measuring<00:06:52.750> with<00:06:53.680> testing<00:06:54.190> with<00:06:54.280> a<00:06:54.430> couple<00:06:54.700> of

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
measuring with testing with a couple of

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.180 
measuring with testing with a couple of
bikes<00:06:54.910> and<00:06:55.150> that<00:06:55.240> seemed<00:06:55.480> what<00:06:55.630> it<00:06:55.720> would<00:06:55.810> be

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
bikes and that seemed what it would be

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.920 
bikes and that seemed what it would be
the<00:06:57.190> best<00:06:57.430> option<00:06:57.640> or<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.180> best<00:06:58.570> measurement

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
the best option or the best measurement

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.560 
the best option or the best measurement
there<00:06:59.200> now<00:06:59.590> I'd<00:06:59.740> put<00:06:59.950> bikes<00:07:00.190> in<00:07:00.370> here<00:07:00.580> show<00:07:01.510> you

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
there now I'd put bikes in here show you

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.400 
there now I'd put bikes in here show you
how<00:07:01.780> well<00:07:01.960> it<00:07:02.080> works

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
how well it works

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.830
