manufacturer from Hong Kong and they are
showing<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> thinnest<00:00:23.100> netbook<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.029> computex

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
showing a thinnest netbook and computex

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.710 
showing a thinnest netbook and computex
that's<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> avon<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.849> also<00:00:27.090> called<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that's the avon one it's also called the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
that's the avon one it's also called the
MINIX<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.289> it's<00:00:31.289> definitely

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
MINIX and as you can see it's definitely

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
MINIX and as you can see it's definitely
super<00:00:32.759> thin<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> give<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.230> an

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
super thin just to give you an

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.700 
super thin just to give you an
impression<00:00:34.760> like<00:00:35.840> size<00:00:36.840> comparison<00:00:37.559> between

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
impression like size comparison between

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
impression like size comparison between
this<00:00:38.040> one<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.460> samsung<00:00:38.969> nc10<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.079> that's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this one and my samsung nc10 so that's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470 
this one and my samsung nc10 so that's
definitely<00:00:40.530> quite<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.010> difference<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
definitely quite a difference one and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470 
definitely quite a difference one and
also<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.170> terms<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.920> weight<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.730> let's<00:00:45.210> take<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
also in terms of weight but let's take a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
also in terms of weight but let's take a
quick<00:00:45.809> look<00:00:45.989> around<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.530> system<00:00:46.980> itself<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
quick look around the system itself is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.029 
quick look around the system itself is
starting<00:00:47.969> from<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.270> side<00:00:49.039> pretty

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
starting from the right side pretty

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
battery life on the six cell now let's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.479 
battery life on the six cell now let's
open<00:02:07.110> those<00:02:07.940> beautiful<00:02:09.049> netbook<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:11.280> see

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
open those beautiful netbook and you see

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.150 
open those beautiful netbook and you see
immediately<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.299> comes<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.840> windows<00:02:13.290> 7<00:02:13.739> so

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
immediately it comes with windows 7 so

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.759 
immediately it comes with windows 7 so
what<00:02:14.340> JW<00:02:15.000> told<00:02:15.299> us<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.290> will<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.620> the
