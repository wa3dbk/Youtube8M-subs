00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 is still developing into one 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:01:10.470
 economic book knows what I said 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:01:40.400
 I do not know what I'm in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:40.400
 Baumhaus I can not do everything now 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.399
 level undefeated 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.160
 side effect that there what do you say about it 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.470
 if you go from there then to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.200
 right looks so 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.700
 is that right there because of the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
 Waterfall is then, of course 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.200
 think I have to build even higher 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.320
 I even feel a bit cooler 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:44.900
 Honestly, when we do our project 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:48.080
 Alright, I think that's good 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.080
 make clear 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:29.340
 because now they are broken 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:33.019
 some laser if I mean first 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:38.670
 effectively age like many opponents histon 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.290
 but I think that is ole is not 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.280
 muskete there is such a really fat 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.230
 cannon 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 there is ambrosia fortune there 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.010
 morning Star 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.440
 we definitely need an iphone 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:02.330
 fans head there is everything makes everything 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:06.480
 meaning you need silver everything 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.620
 muskets and weapons will go on 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.130
 Do you know who you 're collecting for? 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 Peter no problem 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.049
 By the way, gold is not anymore 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.140

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.520
