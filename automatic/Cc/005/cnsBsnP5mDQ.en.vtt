00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
if you notice the the earlier X rings
also<00:00:37.920> tend<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.340> chubby<00:00:38.820> whereas

tell you so have extendable targeting
computer<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:19.200> press<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> button

computer it's in it you press the button

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.499 
computer it's in it you press the button
at<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:23.030> laser<00:01:24.030> laser<00:01:24.950> Canon<00:01:25.950> sound

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
at the back and laser laser Canon sound

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.569 
at the back and laser laser Canon sound
also<00:01:28.250> underneath<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
also underneath you have the

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.740 
also underneath you have the
undercarriage<00:01:33.680> comes<00:01:34.700> down<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.329> land

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
undercarriage comes down so I can land

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
undercarriage comes down so I can land
as<00:01:37.110> per<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> film<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> looks<00:01:39.030> more

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
as per the film and it looks more

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
as per the film and it looks more
realistic<00:01:39.920> for<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> proper<00:01:41.310> realistic

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
realistic for the proper realistic

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.480 
realistic for the proper realistic
undercarriage<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> may<00:01:43.680> notice<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
undercarriage as you may notice there is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.710 
undercarriage as you may notice there is
a<00:01:44.520> handle<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.149> day<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:48.210> handle<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.659> be

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
a handle one day this handle can be

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
a handle one day this handle can be
detached<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.710> rid<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> can

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
detached so we got rid of or you can

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.280 
detached so we got rid of or you can
fold<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.860> hold<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.340> x-wing<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> way

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
fold it up and hold the x-wing this way

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.630 
fold it up and hold the x-wing this way
so<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.409> also<00:01:55.530> there's<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> trigger<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.520> has

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so it's also there's a trigger it has

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
so it's also there's a trigger it has
it's<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> powerful<00:01:57.390> force<00:01:57.570> FX<00:01:57.899> x-wing<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it's a powerful force FX x-wing so it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
it's a powerful force FX x-wing so it
has<00:01:58.860> lights<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> sounds<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.810> pull<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
has lights and sounds you pull this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
has lights and sounds you pull this
trigger<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.890> missile<00:02:02.219> fires<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.790> are

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
trigger and a missile fires out are

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
trigger and a missile fires out are
there<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.740> Emax<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> sound

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
there and you make the Emax the sound

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.110 
there and you make the Emax the sound
the<00:02:05.460> proton<00:02:05.759> torpedoes<00:02:06.240> launching<00:02:06.659> thus

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.470 

you<00:02:11.120> have<00:02:11.240> several<00:02:11.630> sounds<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.530> effects

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
you have several sounds and effects

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:44.260 
you have several sounds and effects
there<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:14.570> go<00:02:14.690> for<00:02:14.900> example<00:02:43.000> there's<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.090> button

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
there we go for example there's a button
