00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the onion and then Ivan I want to go

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.889 
ahead and add in the salt and pepper and
I<00:01:01.949> don't<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.940> amount<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I don't really have an amount for the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
I don't really have an amount for the
salt<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.260> pepper<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> recipe<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
salt and pepper for a recipe like this I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.310 
salt and pepper for a recipe like this I
just<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.540> enough<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> cover<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.799> meat

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
just do enough to cover all of the meat

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
just do enough to cover all of the meat
so<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.619> probably<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.850> quarter<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
so it's probably around a quarter to a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.210

half<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> teaspoon<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.040> need<00:01:14.189> a
