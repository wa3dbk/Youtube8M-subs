00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 um 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.339
 hello guys and girls from youtube me 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.949
 I have to do a mini tutorial of the xp 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.860
 punk a mod that what allows us is 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.349
 save our experience like this 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.640
 we can go quietly to kill for 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:28.260
 there without having any fear that we die 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.960
 and lose the whole experience 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 This mode is enabled for the mode 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.910
 multiplayer is basically its function 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 principal 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 so we can create a server and that all 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.200
 our players 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.210
 keep your experience worth then 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.640
 let's go let's see 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.699
 what is it about and well then I do not 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.770
 I have no experience, and the 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.710
 two items that we are going to have are going to be 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.680
 these this is for for mode 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.559
 multiplayer for the servers mode and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.559
 such and this would be the player mode 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:12.890
 of single player good if we put here 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.990
 the bank is worth doing right button 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.460
 let's access this screen voucher 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.500
 where can we change the texture 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.560
 set yourself vale 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.770
 this is the texture zero is that you do not see 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.770
 all right 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 well you see this corner now going to 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.680
 change texture is worth 1 to 0 not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.590
 there is more 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 it's good, it seems that it's cooler than 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.030
 the other and this would be the other for him 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.670
 and here the same goes for the issue of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.479
 multiplayer good if we make button 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.600
 right what is said here we can pick up the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.280
 experience or deposit it is also worth 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.450
 let's be able to say if we want 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.570
 deposit 50% or 10% all and the same 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.540
 we could either deposit it or pick it up 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.360
 and good 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.690
 it works that simple it 's that way 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.160
 simple 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.350
 generating levels of 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.750
 experience that we have level 10 of 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.370
 experiences we click here I say to the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.050
 goalkeeper experience 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.510
 automatically in the bank 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 I have my 10 levels of experience and 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.880
 now as you can see here below no longer 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.510
 I have them I can die peacefully 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.190
 I rebuild have five levels 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.350
 spike right here tells me that I have five 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.530
 and I say it is worth depositing less I have 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.960
 15 but I say now I want to pick them up they go 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.110
 for I pick up the 15 or the deposits worth 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.250
 If you notice , they are leaving me 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.220
 placing here said 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.300
 if for example I want to take the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.890
 automatically when he left the bank and 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.060
 I have them put is to say this is something 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.410
 that have been fixed from previous 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.960
 versions that stayed around here the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.540
 experience and could be lost and such if 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.950
 there was some bug so perfect with 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.840
 this has already been fixed and we do not lose 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.840
 absolutely nothing good 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.070
 in good multiplayer mode my 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.470
 name and nothing else appears because it does not 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.470
 we are in the player but let's go 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.940
 I would tell you how many levels I want to leave 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.770
 but I would leave it and not let me 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.710
 I would keep them, I would take care of them in the 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.860
 server but I'm not allowed because this 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.750
 is not this is not a server so this 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.630
 really has no more and well we go with 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.900
 the characters our local are very very 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.490
 Simple bank experience is worth 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.890
 the one player 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.540
 we're going to need the ingots are worth the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.700
 four corners four diamonds and a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.700
 chest in the middle and for him 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.170
 experience changers 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.390
 well it would be would be in this way we 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.359
 worth it with the experience bank 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.939
 ie this server somewhere I 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.880
 I have seen turning the experience into 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:07.120
 gold in coins 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.390
 one currency there is another there is another mode what 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.050
 allows is to do that 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.240
 change the experience for money like that in 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.970
 the server then according to how we are going up 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.959
 we can buy more things in the sun 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.150
 dusk 13 hours 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.759
 and well, this is all 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.699
 there is no more, we do not have more to teach 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:33.600
 and well I hope that you have flown the 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.780
 mini tutorial you can see that it has nothing 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.780
 plus 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.650
 this mode is essential to have 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.479
 installed the ford happy 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.770
 let's leave the page link 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.080

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.759

 with the magic lancer and good simply 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.210
 we would go to our minecraft folder 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.240
 our mods folder and this is where 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.530
 We will take our our motel xp bank 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.509
 that you will also have the link in the 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.900
 description so directly what 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:12.790
 we will copy here we initiate minecraft 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.790
 we are charged the sml of him 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.740
 he will leave the ford happy and ready 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.380
 now if we go to motorcycles let's see 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.340
 how do we have this deÃ¡n del del 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.340
 previous tutorial 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.640
 I do not appear the xp bank does not appear 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.580
 but if we enter to play yes yes that 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.970
 we are going to have it is true it did not appear 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.190
 on the publisher's page you have it 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.530
 appears for the servers issue 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.650
 and I think that they also removed it from 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.650
 the 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.639
 I'll get out of the cne and so that I do not 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.719

 no problems with servers so 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.569
 ready 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.090
