the primary chords in each key in other
words<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> key<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> C<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.729> would

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
words if you're in the key of C it would

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.039 
words if you're in the key of C it would
just<00:01:09.360> use<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> primary<00:01:09.900> chord<00:01:10.350> C<00:01:10.650> F<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.790> G<00:01:12.090> now

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
just use the primary chord C F and G now

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
just use the primary chord C F and G now
it<00:01:13.229> ends<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.619> sounding<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.130> lot<00:01:14.250> more

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it ends up sounding a lot more

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
it ends up sounding a lot more
sophisticated<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.990> I'll<00:01:16.470> show

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
sophisticated than that and I'll show

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.830 
sophisticated than that and I'll show
you<00:01:16.770> why<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.250> time<00:01:17.520> goes<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you why as time goes by but that's the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
you why as time goes by but that's the
basis<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.950> four<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.640> five<00:01:21.150> four

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
basis it just the one four and five four

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.200 
basis it just the one four and five four
okay<00:01:21.770> now<00:01:22.770> musicians<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.790> course<00:01:24.030> use

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
okay now musicians of course use

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
okay now musicians of course use
substitutes<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:24.960> those<00:01:25.229> chords<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
substitutes for those chords but it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
substitutes for those chords but it
started<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> often<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
started out this way and it often you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.969 
started out this way and it often you
know<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.560> often<00:01:28.920> played<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.369> way<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
know is often played this way too so in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.550 
know is often played this way too so in
the<00:01:32.700> key<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> F<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> one

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the key of F then that would be the one

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
the key of F then that would be the one
chord<00:01:34.950> would<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.460> F<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.119> four<00:01:36.390> chord<00:01:36.689> three

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the scale of b-flat then the one chord

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.980 
the scale of b-flat then the one chord
of<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.170> b-flat<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.369> fourth<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.659> flat

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990

okay<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.110> can<00:05:25.260> make<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> melody<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:27.210> can

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
okay so you can make a melody you can

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330 
okay so you can make a melody you can
create<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.630> melody<00:05:27.840> out<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.500> just<00:05:28.800> playing<00:05:29.070> with

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
create a melody out of just playing with

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.550 
create a melody out of just playing with
those<00:05:29.520> those<00:05:30.120> flat<00:05:30.480> thirds<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.020> fifths<00:05:31.170> can't

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
those those flat thirds and fifths can't

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.310 
those those flat thirds and fifths can't
you<00:05:31.710> on<00:05:31.889> those<00:05:32.040> three<00:05:32.280> court<00:05:32.580> okay

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
you on those three court okay

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.930 
you on those three court okay
so<00:05:34.320> then<00:05:34.770> that's<00:05:35.040> all<00:05:35.220> that's<00:05:35.490> really<00:05:35.730> all

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
so then that's all that's really all

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.340 
so then that's all that's really all
there<00:05:36.120> is<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.419> it<00:05:36.540> because<00:05:36.810> then<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.050> just

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
there is to it because then it just

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.110 
there is to it because then it just
becomes<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:37.919> matter<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.340> different<00:05:38.790> kind<00:05:38.970> of

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
becomes a matter of different kind of

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.159 
becomes a matter of different kind of
forms<00:05:39.510> such<00:05:39.690> as<00:05:39.720> rhythm

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:52.270 

you

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.070 

you<00:05:53.280> have<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.520> New<00:05:53.730> Orleans<00:05:53.760> kind<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.720> bead<00:05:54.900> you

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
you have a New Orleans kind of bead you

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:06.520 
you have a New Orleans kind of bead you
can<00:05:55.110> have<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.380> Kansas<00:05:55.980> City<00:05:56.010> kind<00:05:56.580> of<00:05:56.700> feeling

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.200 

you<00:06:07.530> know<00:06:07.650> all<00:06:07.800> kinds<00:06:08.040> of<00:06:08.250> things<00:06:08.490> in<00:06:08.760> in<00:06:08.940> the

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
you know all kinds of things in in the

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.570 
you know all kinds of things in in the
blues<00:06:09.450> just<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.290> rhythm<00:06:10.500> can<00:06:10.860> change<00:06:11.190> it's<00:06:11.430> on

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
blues just the rhythm can change it's on

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.700 
blues just the rhythm can change it's on
but<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.120> see<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.420> format<00:06:12.900> of<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.200> one<00:06:13.380> four

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
but you see the format of the one four

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.800 
but you see the format of the one four
and<00:06:13.860> five<00:06:14.070> progression<00:06:14.370> stays<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.270> same<00:06:15.300> and

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
and five progression stays the same and

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.440 
and five progression stays the same and
almost<00:06:16.710> always<00:06:17.010> includes<00:06:17.580> those<00:06:17.820> elements

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
almost always includes those elements

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.320 
almost always includes those elements
such<00:06:18.600> as<00:06:18.950> the<00:06:19.950> seventh<00:06:20.400> of<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.850> chord<00:06:21.090> being

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
such as the seventh of the chord being

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.680 
such as the seventh of the chord being
used<00:06:21.630> and<00:06:21.990> playing<00:06:22.890> around<00:06:23.070> with<00:06:23.400> with<00:06:24.030> blue

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
used and playing around with with blue

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.140 
used and playing around with with blue
notes<00:06:24.930> off<00:06:25.170> playing<00:06:25.740> off<00:06:25.980> the<00:06:26.400> flat<00:06:26.640> 3rd<00:06:26.910> and

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
notes off playing off the flat 3rd and

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.540 
notes off playing off the flat 3rd and
off<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.420> flat<00:06:27.660> fifth<00:06:28.070> so<00:06:29.070> that's<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.460> music

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
off the flat fifth so that's the music

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.370 
off the flat fifth so that's the music
theory<00:06:30.090> behind<00:06:30.300> the<00:06:30.720> Blues<00:06:30.900> I<00:06:31.110> don't<00:06:31.260> mean

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
theory behind the Blues I don't mean

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.780 
theory behind the Blues I don't mean
that's<00:06:31.590> all<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.950> music<00:06:32.190> theory<00:06:32.430> but<00:06:32.580> that's

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
that's all the music theory but that's

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.060 
that's all the music theory but that's
the<00:06:32.970> basic<00:06:33.390> music<00:06:33.960> theory<00:06:34.170> behind<00:06:34.470> the<00:06:34.830> blues

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
the basic music theory behind the blues

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.770 
the basic music theory behind the blues
and<00:06:35.250> from<00:06:35.790> then<00:06:35.970> it's<00:06:36.150> just<00:06:36.360> applying

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
and from then it's just applying

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.090 
and from then it's just applying
different<00:06:36.960> rhythms<00:06:37.470> and<00:06:37.740> course

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
different rhythms and course

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.910 
different rhythms and course
substitutions<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.060> so<00:06:39.270> on<00:06:39.390> when<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.290> modern

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
substitutions and so on when a modern

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.920 
substitutions and so on when a modern
jazz<00:06:41.220> group<00:06:41.520> plays<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:42.090> Blues<00:06:42.330> you<00:06:42.360> may<00:06:42.720> have

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
jazz group plays the Blues you may have

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.550 
jazz group plays the Blues you may have
a<00:06:42.960> little<00:06:43.140> trouble<00:06:44.780> following<00:06:45.780> it<00:06:46.080> because

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
a little trouble following it because

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560 
a little trouble following it because
there's<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.070> many<00:06:47.160> core<00:06:47.550> substitutions<00:06:48.390> are

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
there's so many core substitutions are

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.600 
there's so many core substitutions are
being<00:06:48.810> used<00:06:49.050> if<00:06:49.350> we<00:06:49.830> say<00:06:50.070> you're<00:06:50.280> in<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.400> key

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
being used if we say you're in the key

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.000 
being used if we say you're in the key
of<00:06:50.640> F

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.230 

they<00:06:58.010> may<00:06:58.250> move<00:06:58.490> from<00:06:58.910> the<00:06:59.030> F<00:06:59.210> chord<00:06:59.770> to<00:07:00.770> the

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
they may move from the F chord to the

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.480 
they may move from the F chord to the
half-step<00:07:02.240> to<00:07:02.270> the<00:07:02.630> b-flat<00:07:03.230> at<00:07:03.620> the<00:07:03.980> B<00:07:04.160> chord

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
half-step to the b-flat at the B chord

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.730

sliding<00:07:04.940> into<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.300> B<00:07:05.480> flat<00:07:05.630> chord<00:07:06.080> and<00:07:06.320> then

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
sliding into the B flat chord and then

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.650 
sliding into the B flat chord and then
when<00:07:06.920> you<00:07:07.010> when<00:07:07.700> they<00:07:07.820> get<00:07:08.000> to<00:07:08.120> the<00:07:08.210> B<00:07:08.360> flat

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
when you when they get to the B flat

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.140 
when you when they get to the B flat
chord<00:07:08.690> they<00:07:09.680> may<00:07:09.890> use<00:07:10.100> the<00:07:10.310> suspension<00:07:10.940> so<00:07:11.060> you

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
chord they may use the suspension so you

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.090 
chord they may use the suspension so you
don't<00:07:11.330> really<00:07:11.540> recognize<00:07:11.840> it<00:07:14.830> same<00:07:15.830> on<00:07:15.980> the
