that stuff is going around runescape I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
that stuff is going around runescape I
think<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.809> makes<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> community

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
think that just makes the community

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
think that just makes the community
pretty<00:00:56.100> bad<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.550> everybody's<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pretty bad because everybody's going to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.740 
pretty bad because everybody's going to
be<00:00:57.360> greedy<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:59.239> everybody<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.300> wants<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
be greedy and everybody just wants the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
be greedy and everybody just wants the
real-life<00:01:00.989> money<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.859> D<00:01:01.920> Dawson<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.789> anything

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
real-life money by D Dawson and anything

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
real-life money by D Dawson and anything
that<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.439> could<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.010> key<00:01:05.250> logging

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that that they could do like key logging

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.230 
that that they could do like key logging
it's<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.479> i<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:09.210> know

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it's not like that i think you know

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.469 
it's not like that i think you know
selling<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:10.020> gold<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.619> real-life<00:01:10.890> money

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
selling your gold for real-life money

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
selling your gold for real-life money
makes<00:01:12.479> everybody<00:01:12.960> act<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.560> because

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
makes everybody act like this because

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.899 
makes everybody act like this because
they<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.250> greedy<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> stuff<00:01:14.790> like

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
would have got 3.5 which have been

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.810 
would have got 3.5 which have been
pretty<00:07:14.640> harsh<00:07:15.110> you<00:07:16.110> know<00:07:16.200> 3.5<00:07:16.710> GPA<00:07:17.040> and<00:07:17.310> I<00:07:17.640> just

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
pretty harsh you know 3.5 GPA and I just

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.060 
pretty harsh you know 3.5 GPA and I just
hate<00:07:17.970> how<00:07:18.060> like<00:07:18.300> gear<00:07:18.960> is<00:07:19.080> a<00:07:19.590> seventy-nine

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
hate how like gear is a seventy-nine

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.700 
hate how like gear is a seventy-nine
percent<00:07:20.190> and<00:07:20.930> the<00:07:21.930> teacher<00:07:22.170> doesn't<00:07:22.590> move<00:07:22.650> you

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
percent and the teacher doesn't move you

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.620 
percent and the teacher doesn't move you
up<00:07:22.860> I<00:07:23.130> just<00:07:23.310> hate<00:07:23.460> that<00:07:23.520> because<00:07:23.940> then<00:07:24.330> that

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
up I just hate that because then that

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
up I just hate that because then that
counts<00:07:25.590> it<00:07:25.680> as<00:07:25.710> a<00:07:26.120> 24<00:07:27.120> you<00:07:27.210> GPA<00:07:27.600> in<00:07:27.930> step<00:07:28.110> 3

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
counts it as a 24 you GPA in step 3

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.670 
counts it as a 24 you GPA in step 3
which<00:07:29.130> is<00:07:29.310> a<00:07:29.340> huge<00:07:29.640> difference<00:07:29.910> and<00:07:30.290> it<00:07:31.290> can

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
which is a huge difference and it can

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.040 
which is a huge difference and it can
determine<00:07:32.460> the<00:07:33.000> rest<00:07:33.150> of<00:07:33.300> your<00:07:33.450> life<00:07:33.570> because

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
determine the rest of your life because

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.140 
determine the rest of your life because
you<00:07:34.440> can<00:07:34.590> determine<00:07:35.070> which<00:07:35.400> college<00:07:35.760> 02<00:07:36.120> and

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
you can determine which college 02 and

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.910 
you can determine which college 02 and
stuff<00:07:36.390> like<00:07:36.510> that<00:07:36.570> so<00:07:37.320> that's<00:07:37.500> pretty<00:07:37.680> crazy

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:37.920 
stuff like that so that's pretty crazy

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.210
