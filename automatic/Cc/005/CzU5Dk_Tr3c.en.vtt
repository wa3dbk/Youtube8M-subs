 another staff already know about the 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:18.160
 facilitated ok and not without before 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.550
 remind them that if they look for marie moore 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.720
 marisela pacheco to give in the name of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.090
 marisela pacheco and directly to 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.189
 our channel and subscribe so that 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.419
 can enjoy all the videos that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.270
 we are going up and we will continue 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.390
 going up we go forward with our 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.390
 work 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.000
 I already have the first stitch in here 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.520
 of the hook and I will give a two three 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.970
 chains I'm random 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.530
 and in this part of here 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.070
 in the first chain 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.100
 I'm going to put 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.460
 I'm going to take out 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.970
 and I'm going to grab here 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.340
 the first two chains of the massif 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.940
 again I tie it here in the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.150
 first chain 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:22.150
 there and I'm going to grab nothing else there are both 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
 12 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.270
 first chains of the massif and I return to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.000
 do what 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.369
 and I see him again, he went back to the chains 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.179
 separated nothing else I'm going to grab the two 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.320
 first ten box office I made three and what 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.270
 I'm going to close and I'm going to put it here 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.100
 in this way I'm going to make a little path 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.650
 because this nothing else is the basis for 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.330
 put the other the other is the other side the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:57.159
 figure of the shore that we are going to do 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:59.469
 very well here I will give 1 2 3 chains 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.909
 I'm going randomly and now I'm going to put it here 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.649
 exactly below sac methods 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.470
 like nothing else I'm going to grab the two 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.790
 first chains of my mass again 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.709
 in the loop sac and here is I'm going to go back 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.209
 to win nothing else the first two 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:23.430
 chains there I take two and I put back 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.430
 I go back to take it out and there I still see it 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.050
 grabbed the first two and then grabbed 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.920
 all like that I'm going to do it from here to 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.920
 that on this side 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.340
 very well I already have here my base now with 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.069
 the thread 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.540
 we go exactly here where they do the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.710
 half I'm going to put my hook I'm going to throw 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.290
 and here I'm going to grab 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.090
 there I have it again I will do what 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.090
 same method sack and 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:19.610
 now here I am going to make 3 chains 1 2 3 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:25.120
 and then I'm going to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:29.200
 10 loops I'm going to put it right here 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.640
 I'm going to take it out there and I'm going to pull them all 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.440
 together 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.890
 there I will pass them all there I have it 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:47.300
 Now I'm going to give there 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:56.580
 one chain and another one again 1 2 3 4 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:59.160
 5 6 7 8 9 10 loops and I put back in 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.069
 this same place where I started 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.430
 loop sack and there 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:11.819
 I'm going to pass my hook through the middle of 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.049
 the 10 lassos there I have it there is 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:26.550
 alright now I'm going to do 10 chains here 1 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:28.969
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and I'm going to give me 1 2 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.340
 3 and here in the third 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:35.050
 I will return 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.050
 put in the middle part 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.030
 and I'm going to make a massif 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:54.380
 and I have it 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:56.220
 Now I'm going to do here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.110
 10 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.420
 I put back here 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.870
 sack ties and I'll grab it again 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.870
 there 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.680
 efe 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:17.050
 and I give it 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:22.200
 there is one more chain or two now 1 2 3 4 5 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:28.220
 6 7 8 9 10 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.220
 I put it in and take it out again 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.860
 if I'm going to make a chain here very well 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.660
 now I have it here now I'm going to 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.460
 turn around 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.310
 to my work 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.400
 and I'm going to put here in the middle 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.280
 point 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.160
 and then I 'm going to come up this chain 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.610
 from the beginning 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.820
 with another half point and here I'm going to take 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:07.310
 1 2 3 chains 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:12.030
 I'm going to give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and I'm going 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.540

 I'm going to win 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.910
 there I will give you a 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.910
 chain
