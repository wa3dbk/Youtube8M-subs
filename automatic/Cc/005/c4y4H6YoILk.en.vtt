more time I've already lost once it took
me<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> roughly<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.910> think<00:00:53.960> two<00:00:54.960> months<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

I've<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.760> averaging<00:01:00.270> around<00:01:00.420> three<00:01:00.930> ones<00:01:01.230> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I've been averaging around three ones so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.649 
I've been averaging around three ones so
maybe<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> month<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.049> day<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> check<00:01:05.250> i

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
maybe a month a day I have to check i

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.890 
maybe a month a day I have to check i
