00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.399
 the couple was dancing math we're here in the trigonometry room 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.190
 and now I'll talk a little bit about the signal of the functions being 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.079
 many people 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.080
 beginning with the function 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.439
 sits 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:16.929
 tite 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 the senator with less than one month of last year 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.260
 vandinho that our duties are not being accused then we 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.489
 it's a straight 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.439
 the projection in the year 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.220
 and here we will see said 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.240
 this time here 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.270
 7 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.270
 so let's get married at least let's go down 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 chisinau and chinese uige 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 No, but it's five years from now. 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.840
 positive in that year then in a first quadrant and in the second flagrant 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860
 We are going to have this year's auctions. 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.800
 positive had to pick up here at the point 45graus 60 degrees 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.810
 in the northeast the positive trend 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.670
 also 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.400
 there are champions 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.220
 a little bit but more than 180 degrees 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.190
 and then left with the 180graus with the team totally underneath 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.010
 all sides said molon 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.440
 if we look 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.860
 on the bottom so we'll be done 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 negative candê not have been brilliant 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 how much in the central headquarters are family reunions 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 smaller 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.050
 according to the post growing 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.110
 on apartes 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.890
 gadelha said that it is a summary in me good for people son in the die without doping 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.130
 the signs and symptoms 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.909
 so let's go with everything with the cia 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.909
 skateboard 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.650
 a little bit of money 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.430
 based on a projection and then the projection results 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 we are going to measure 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.590
 exactly 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 luis xv 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.370
 So 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.719
 tekken pracatum action the thieves 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.920
 positive and here 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.309
 in the two weeks 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:13.559
 negative 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 So we're talking to the first quadrant. 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.719
 that is an instance like this 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.279
 look away 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.279
 the detainees 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.489
 when we take the second quadrant 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.489
 according to the attacker will not have class of the look 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.249
 your side 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.979
 moore and a negative 1% 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.799
 when I have a third quadrant 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.010
 as a matter of fact 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.349
 and to be nothing 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.459
 sporting is to have too 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.459
 is the fourth quadrant north guarantee good night 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.480
 the official announcement so mr 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.759
 fatten 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.249
 the part 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.679
 positive 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.559
 among other senate 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.769
 more and more - grandchildren 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 the Brazilian more or less by the marks 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.059
 and now finally let's talk a little boring 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 so many people 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.909
 currently it reports that it will be 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.519
 From the outside here we were in the supermarket 3 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:26.280
 how are there particularities 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.339
 enough if we work 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.289
 he thinks she can grow 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.919
 as much as she wants it will not be limited just as it concerns the senate 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.610
 who has lots of mom and kids 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.849
 malanje - one 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.689
 see you guys 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.959
 the attendant 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 in phoenix then how are we going to analyze 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.669
 to know a store people in the first quadrant 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:51.969
 we want to impose ourselves 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.959
 we pick we will improve 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.149
 to leave 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.049
 positive or 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.949
 It's positive from here to here. 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.609
 identity 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.779
 and so 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.109
 negative 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.580
 let's get better 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.889
 the crime was practiced in tweet 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.179
 if agent does not cancel tst 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:15.909
 go to the match 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.639
 tom and david 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.639
 being the first quadrant we want it to be 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.710
 positive mass agents for the game this afternoon positive 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.629
 in the second quadrant team with three 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:30.740
 the people 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.150
 helps a lot on the personal side 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.909
 macaé or tiguan 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.090
 it was the proof 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.999
 the most alarming is that people 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.840
 in this case we kick 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.529
 we the students 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.360
 prolongations he denies 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.529
 on the other hand 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.199
 I mean, it's falling down here. 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.809
 and now 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.620
 negative 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.289
 other aircraft 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.370
 We'll get it. 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.159
 and goes around with another world 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.159
 when the first quadrant was in this direction will pick up the part 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.129
 positive 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.499
 that is 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.659
 but they are not positive 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.269
 he in the last program says in the grand slam room of beijing 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.330
 the years 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.740
 same score 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.749
 in that match 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.999
 negative at the end 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.610
 negative 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.610
 the success of those times summed up 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.669
 signs of this year's functions 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.669
 with the floods 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.190
 following a clash with a shotgun 12 kilometers of line 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.610
 and the hands graphics of each of the sensors 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.250
 spencer if it shows useful this replica in bushehr he said that in the networks 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.350
