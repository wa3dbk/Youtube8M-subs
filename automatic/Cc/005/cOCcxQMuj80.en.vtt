00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
did get a little bit crazy by the end it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
did get a little bit crazy by the end it
was<00:01:21.090> definitely<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> those<00:01:21.810> stories<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.880 
was definitely one of those stories that
because<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> magical<00:01:23.850> elements<00:01:24.500> by<00:01:25.500> Rodin

because of the magical elements by Rodin

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.859 
because of the magical elements by Rodin
just<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:27.030> confusing<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
just got a little bit confusing and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.980 
just got a little bit confusing and
wayward<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> may<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.450> may<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.630> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
wayward and so you may or may not like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
wayward and so you may or may not like
that<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.979> those<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that it's one of those things where it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.819 
that it's one of those things where it
all<00:01:33.150> wrapped<00:01:33.540> together<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.229> nicely<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
all wrapped together and nicely in the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.179 
all wrapped together and nicely in the
end<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.630> mad<00:01:37.409> plots<00:01:37.950> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
end but if you don't like mad plots that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
really take some crazy turns and you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
really take some crazy turns and you
might<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:41.970> favorite

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
what I just find an excessive amount of

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.330 
what I just find an excessive amount of
references<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.290> like<00:02:27.290> women's<00:02:27.680> butts<00:02:28.010> and

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
mind references to sex and things like

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.259 
mind references to sex and things like
that<00:02:33.830> in<00:02:34.010> books<00:02:34.190> but<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.519> just<00:02:34.760> felt<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.090> bit

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
that in books but this just felt a bit

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.300 
that in books but this just felt a bit
like<00:02:35.299> okay<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.290> don't<00:02:36.410> need<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.860> know<00:02:36.980> every

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
like okay I don't need to know every

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.309 
like okay I don't need to know every
time<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.180> character<00:02:38.540> gets<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.840> bit<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.110> boner

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
time the character gets a bit of a boner

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.259 
time the character gets a bit of a boner
and<00:02:39.620> almost<00:02:40.430> all<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.819> female<00:02:41.239> characters

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
and almost all of the female characters

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.920 
and almost all of the female characters
I<00:02:41.870> felt<00:02:42.110> were<00:02:42.380> really<00:02:43.150> whittled<00:02:44.150> down<00:02:44.269> to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
I felt were really whittled down to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.270 
I felt were really whittled down to
their<00:02:45.049> physical<00:02:45.530> appearance<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.099> main

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
their physical appearance the main

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.089 
their physical appearance the main
character<00:02:46.970> whenever<00:02:47.840> he<00:02:48.200> first<00:02:48.470> saw<00:02:48.680> them<00:02:48.890> it

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
character whenever he first saw them it

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.170 
character whenever he first saw them it
was<00:02:49.250> from<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.579> very<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:50.650> physical<00:02:51.730> sense<00:02:52.730> he

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
was from a very like physical sense he

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.819 
was from a very like physical sense he
kind<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.420> evaluated<00:02:54.049> them<00:02:54.200> all<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.590> and

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
kind of evaluated them all on that and

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.559 
kind of evaluated them all on that and
then<00:02:55.010> continued<00:02:55.579> through<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.910> books<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.390> kind

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
then continued through the books to kind

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.080 
then continued through the books to kind
of<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:56.870> reference<00:02:57.769> their<00:02:57.980> body<00:02:58.250> parts<00:02:58.790> I'm

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
of like reference their body parts I'm

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.789 
of like reference their body parts I'm
not<00:02:59.120> gonna<00:02:59.390> lie<00:02:59.599> definitely<00:03:00.319> brought<00:03:00.590> down

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
not gonna lie definitely brought down

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.759 
not gonna lie definitely brought down
the<00:03:01.130> rating<00:03:01.549> for<00:03:01.790> me<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:03.290> wasn't<00:03:03.709> a

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
the rating for me I like wasn't a

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.530 
the rating for me I like wasn't a
massive<00:03:04.160> fan<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> think<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.150> picked<00:03:05.420> me

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
massive fan of that I think it picked me

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.539 
massive fan of that I think it picked me
off<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.930> main<00:03:06.140> character<00:03:06.680> who<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.190> otherwise

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
off the main character who I otherwise

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.670 
off the main character who I otherwise
really<00:03:08.090> liked<00:03:08.360> that's<00:03:08.989> why<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.230> book<00:03:09.470> wasn't

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
really liked that's why this book wasn't

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.979 
really liked that's why this book wasn't
ideal<00:03:10.430> for<00:03:10.760> me<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:11.480> said<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.810> got<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
ideal for me and like I said it got a

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.039 
ideal for me and like I said it got a
little<00:03:12.410> bit<00:03:12.590> crazy<00:03:12.709> near<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.880> end<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.420> there

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
little bit crazy near the end and there

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.420 
little bit crazy near the end and there
was<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.350> point<00:03:15.650> where<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:15.799> was<00:03:15.950> like<00:03:16.069> I'm

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
was like a point where I was like I'm

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.580 
was like a point where I was like I'm
not<00:03:16.579> sure<00:03:16.850> where<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.350> then<00:03:18.500> it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
not sure where this is going but then it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.930 
not sure where this is going but then it
did<00:03:18.739> turn<00:03:18.920> around<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.549> enjoyed<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
did turn around and I enjoyed the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.819 
did turn around and I enjoyed the
conclusion<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.810> think<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.109> was<00:03:21.260> wrapped<00:03:21.620> up

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
conclusion I think it was wrapped up

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.800 
conclusion I think it was wrapped up
