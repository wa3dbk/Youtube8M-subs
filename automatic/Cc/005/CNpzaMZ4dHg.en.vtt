with you guys all right so a question

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.349 
with you guys all right so a question
that<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.930> often<00:00:19.170> get<00:00:19.650> asked<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
that I often get asked is what is the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.599 
that I often get asked is what is the
difference<00:00:21.750> between<00:00:22.130> cardio<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
difference between cardio and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.759 
difference between cardio and
strength-training<00:00:24.150> which<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.019> better<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
strength-training which is better and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.759 
strength-training which is better and
how<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.310> incorporate<00:00:26.490> both<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> not

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
how do I incorporate both so it's not

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
how do I incorporate both so it's not
really<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.189> easy<00:00:30.090> way<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> answer<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
really an easy way to answer that

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
really an easy way to answer that
question<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.309> difference<00:00:32.579> between

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
question but the difference between

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510 
question but the difference between
cardio<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> strength-training<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:35.010> one

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
cardio and strength-training is that one

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.510 
cardio and strength-training is that one
is<00:00:35.730> aerobic<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.350> cardio<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.100> one<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
is aerobic which is cardio and one is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.869 
is aerobic which is cardio and one is
anaerobic<00:00:39.110> during<00:00:40.110> aerobic<00:00:40.500> exercise<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
anaerobic during aerobic exercise the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
anaerobic during aerobic exercise the
body<00:00:42.149> draws<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.930> glycogen<00:00:43.730> and/or<00:00:44.789> fat<00:00:45.600> for

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
body draws on glycogen and/or fat for

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.940 
body draws on glycogen and/or fat for
energy<00:00:46.590> during<00:00:47.489> an<00:00:47.730> aerobic<00:00:48.690> exercise<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
energy during an aerobic exercise the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.900 
energy during an aerobic exercise the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
body cannot draw easily on fat stores

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.840 
body cannot draw easily on fat stores
the<00:00:54.660> mistake<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.469> people<00:00:55.710> often<00:00:56.370> make<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the mistake that people often make is

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.470 
the mistake that people often make is
that<00:00:57.510> they'll<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.230> their<00:00:58.410> cardio<00:00:58.890> workouts

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
that they'll do their cardio workouts

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
that they'll do their cardio workouts
before<00:01:00.480> their<00:01:01.079> strength<00:01:01.500> training<00:01:01.800> workouts

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
before their strength training workouts

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
before their strength training workouts
now<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> common

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
now if you think about it from a common

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
now if you think about it from a common
sense<00:01:04.589> perspective<00:01:04.739> why<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> bad<00:01:05.820> well

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
sense perspective why is that bad well

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.440 
sense perspective why is that bad well
if<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.320> exhaust<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:08.070> legs<00:01:08.369> by<00:01:08.790> running<00:01:09.119> or

you try and go lift heavy weights or do

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
you try and go lift heavy weights or do
squats<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.540> any<00:01:15.750> sort<00:01:15.900> of

weight-bearing<00:01:16.259> activities<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:17.369> already

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
weight-bearing activities you're already

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.219 
weight-bearing activities you're already
going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.939> fatigued<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.810> doing<00:01:19.110> your

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
cardio first okay that's it of course

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.429 
cardio first okay that's it of course
you<00:01:21.270> should<00:01:21.420> always<00:01:21.540> warm<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> only

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you should always warm up but you only

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.280 
you should always warm up but you only
need<00:01:22.710> five<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.009> ten<00:01:23.369> minutes<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:25.110> do

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
need five to ten minutes now if you do

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.070 
need five to ten minutes now if you do
your<00:01:25.530> cardio<00:01:25.890> after<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:27.450> strength<00:01:27.780> training

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
your cardio after your strength training

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.730 
your cardio after your strength training
workout<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.490> body<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.180> depleting<00:01:31.110> its

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
workout the body is depleting its

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
workout the body is depleting its
glycogen<00:01:32.430> stores<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.479> drawing<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
glycogen stores so it's drawing on

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.719 
glycogen stores so it's drawing on
glycogen<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> can't<00:01:34.950> draw<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.520> fat

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
glycogen because it can't draw on to fat

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
glycogen because it can't draw on to fat
okay<00:01:36.450> great<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> power<00:01:37.020> through<00:01:37.350> your

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
okay great you power through your

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
okay great you power through your
strength<00:01:37.890> training<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.400> aerobic<00:01:38.820> workout<00:01:39.240> now

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
strength training an aerobic workout now

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.660 
strength training an aerobic workout now
you<00:01:39.750> move<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.590> cardio<00:01:40.950> well<00:01:41.490> what's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you move on to your cardio well what's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
you move on to your cardio well what's
going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> happen<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.420> you've

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
going to happen is because you've

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.069 
going to happen is because you've
hopefully<00:01:43.820> depleted<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.060> glycogen<00:01:45.390> stores

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
hopefully depleted your glycogen stores
