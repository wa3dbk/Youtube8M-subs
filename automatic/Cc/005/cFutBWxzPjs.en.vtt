bounty is one of the first plugins we've
made<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.300> while<00:00:12.679> it's<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:14.009> multiplayer

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
made in a while it's a multiplayer

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.540 
made in a while it's a multiplayer
plug-in<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.170> basically<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> idea<00:00:17.039> behind<00:00:17.070> it

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
plug-in and basically the idea behind it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.080 
plug-in and basically the idea behind it
is<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:19.189> sort<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.279> become<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> bounty

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
is that you can sort of become a bounty

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.460 
is that you can sort of become a bounty
hunter<00:00:21.270> or<00:00:22.039> setback<00:00:23.039> these<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:24.199> players<00:00:25.199> on

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
hunter or setback these on players on

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890 
hunter or setback these on players on
the<00:00:25.650> server<00:00:25.859> which<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:26.970> want<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.810> know

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

the server which do you want you know
who<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.410> want<00:00:28.439> killed<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.380> basically<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
who you want killed so basically the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.650 
who you want killed so basically the

idea is that if you are setting a bounty

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
idea is that if you are setting a bounty
you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:34.950> some<00:00:35.100> cash<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.550> spare<00:00:35.850> and
