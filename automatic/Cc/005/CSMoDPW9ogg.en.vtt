00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.920 

thought<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> could<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:05.970> away<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.299> just

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
thought what I could get away with just

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 
thought what I could get away with just
rebuilding<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.220> snap

rebuilding the snap

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.140 
rebuilding the snap
basically<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:11.150> take

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
basically what you have to do to take

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
basically what you have to do to take
this<00:01:12.299> apart<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.350> sort<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> clip<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> here

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this apart is some sort of clip in here

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.410 
this apart is some sort of clip in here
and<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> haven't<00:01:14.490> figured<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.790> exactly<00:01:14.970> where

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and I haven't figured out exactly where

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.480 
and I haven't figured out exactly where
it<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.380> take<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> rubber<00:01:17.040> mallet<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it is and you take a rubber mallet and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.240 
it is and you take a rubber mallet and
you<00:01:17.640> gently<00:01:18.060> tap<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.710> whole<00:01:19.890> shaft

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you gently tap this and the whole shaft

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
you gently tap this and the whole shaft
assembly<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:21.330> slide<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.590> tap

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
assembly will slide out then you can tap

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.230 
assembly will slide out then you can tap
take<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> bearing<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
take the bearing out here and there's a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.789 
take the bearing out here and there's a
bearing<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:25.590> out

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bearing back there you can also take out

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920 
bearing back there you can also take out
then<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.490> replace<00:01:27.330> whatever<00:01:27.630> you've<00:01:27.900> got

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.440 
then you can replace whatever you've got
to<00:01:28.140> replace<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> put<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:28.950> back<00:01:28.979> together

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
to replace and put it all back together

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
to replace and put it all back together
