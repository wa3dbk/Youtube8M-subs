00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.179 

the<00:00:20.039> challenge<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.970> turn<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.420> into<00:00:22.189> licks

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the challenge is to turn this into licks

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
the challenge is to turn this into licks
and<00:00:23.880> then<00:00:24.060> race<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.599> on<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.020> track<00:00:25.320> over

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and then race it on that track over

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.010 
and then race it on that track over
there<00:00:25.830> powered<00:00:26.310> only<00:00:26.520> by<00:00:26.789> saltwater<00:00:29.930> it's<00:00:30.930> all

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.990 
there powered only by saltwater it's all
very<00:00:31.169> well<00:00:31.259> before<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:31.919> met<00:00:32.129> be<00:00:32.250> better<00:00:32.550> surely

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
very well before we met be better surely

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
very well before we met be better surely
we<00:00:33.150> can<00:00:33.270> improve<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.840> performance<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.410> these

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
we can improve the performance of these

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.780 
we can improve the performance of these

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
been lightened our car most of all we

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
been lightened our car most of all we
saw<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> slope<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
saw that we have to get up a slope and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.610 
saw that we have to get up a slope and
we<00:00:54.120> thought<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.600> might<00:00:54.750> help<00:00:54.989> who<00:00:55.530> are

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
we thought that it might help who are

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.760 
we thought that it might help who are
you<00:00:55.739> guys<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.730> team<00:00:57.120> Imagineers<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.320> have

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you guys we are team Imagineers we have

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.250 
you guys we are team Imagineers we have
an<00:00:58.859> extra<00:00:59.129> engine<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.539> an<00:01:00.690> extra<00:01:01.140> in

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
an extra engine in this one an extra in

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.049 
an extra engine in this one an extra in
gear<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:01.920> equitable<00:01:02.489> wheel<00:01:02.760> drive

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
gear we have an equitable wheel drive

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.389 
gear we have an equitable wheel drive
what<00:01:03.329> gives<00:01:03.449> us<00:01:03.600> four<00:01:03.809> wheel<00:01:04.019> drive<00:01:04.320> yeah<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
what gives us four wheel drive yeah and

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.040 
what gives us four wheel drive yeah and
then<00:01:05.670> naturally<00:01:05.910> because<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.539> fast<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
then naturally because it's fast it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.080 
then naturally because it's fast it
needs<00:01:07.259> tinted<00:01:07.920> glass<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> big<00:01:08.729> spoiler<00:01:09.060> on
