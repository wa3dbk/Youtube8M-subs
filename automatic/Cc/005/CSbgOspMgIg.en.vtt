Liverpool<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.710> could<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.189> good

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Liverpool so it could be a very good

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
about the deal other than that but I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.850 
about the deal other than that but I
feels<00:01:33.810> could<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> very<00:01:34.320> good<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.799> know

feels could be a very good one I know
it's<00:01:35.100> quite<00:01:35.220> an<00:01:35.400> expensive<00:01:35.610> player<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:37.140> he

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's quite an expensive player but if he

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.899 
it's quite an expensive player but if he
goes<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:37.979> had<00:01:38.130> definitely<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.549> far

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
goes well for them had definitely be far

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.340 
goes well for them had definitely be far
far<00:01:39.150> effective<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.049> soul<00:01:40.170> player

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
far effective like it was soul player

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.780 
far effective like it was soul player
they've<00:01:40.500> needed<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> while<00:01:41.189> next<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.700> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
they've needed for a while next up we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
they've needed for a while next up we
have<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.909> James<00:01:42.210> chest<00:01:42.570> he's<00:01:42.780> made<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> move

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
have a James chest he's made the move

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
have a James chest he's made the move
from<00:01:43.409> hole<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.979> West<00:01:44.280> Brom<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
from hole to West Brom I think it's I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
from hole to West Brom I think it's I
think<00:01:45.659> I'll<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.770> deal

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
think I'll have kind of got a good deal

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.170 
think I'll have kind of got a good deal
out<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.220> James<00:01:47.490> gesture<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> top

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
out of this James gesture is a top

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
out of this James gesture is a top
player<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.630> 8<00:01:49.020> million<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> lot<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
player but 8 million is a lot for a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
player but 8 million is a lot for a
since<00:01:50.579> back<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.180> been<00:01:51.299> part<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
since back that's just been part of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.080 
since back that's just been part of
outside<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.200> gone<00:01:52.380> down<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:53.189> conceding<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
outside that's gone down for conceding a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.639 
outside that's gone down for conceding a
few<00:01:54.270> too<00:01:54.390> many<00:01:54.420> goals<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.259> 8<00:01:55.350> million

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
few too many goals so I think 8 million

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.050 
few too many goals so I think 8 million
I'm<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:55.920> sure<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> best<00:01:56.670> sign<00:01:56.880> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I'm not sure if that's the best sign or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
I'm not sure if that's the best sign or
not<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.360> nonetheless<00:01:57.509> West<00:01:58.170> Brom<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.500> could

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
not but nonetheless West Brom it could

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
not but nonetheless West Brom it could
be<00:01:58.799> wise<00:01:58.920> players<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.850> key<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> them

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
be wise players that is very key to them

good<00:04:35.960> little<00:04:36.139> sign<00:04:36.379> in<00:04:36.530> obviously<00:04:37.129> they<00:04:37.280> have

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
good little sign in obviously they have

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.990 
him and Bradley get a good link up

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
nonetheless next up is Arturo Vidal in

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.339 
nonetheless next up is Arturo Vidal in
my<00:04:52.430> opinion<00:04:52.789> is<00:04:52.909> one<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.389> steals<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.259> the

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
my opinion is one of the steals of the

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.140 
my opinion is one of the steals of the
century<00:04:54.710> twenty<00:04:55.039> eight<00:04:55.129> and<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> half<00:04:55.310> mil<00:04:55.699> for

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
century twenty eight and a half mil for

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.969 
century twenty eight and a half mil for
Vidal<00:04:56.479> to<00:04:56.690> Bayern<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.169> great<00:04:57.530> signing<00:04:57.889> he's

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
Vidal to Bayern is a great signing he's

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.770 
Vidal to Bayern is a great signing he's
a<00:04:58.009> top<00:04:58.250> top<00:04:58.430> player<00:04:58.669> I<00:04:58.849> think<00:04:59.270> again<00:04:59.509> that<00:04:59.690> was

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
a top top player I think again that was

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.029 
a top top player I think again that was
his<00:04:59.900> release<00:05:00.169> clause<00:05:00.440> which<00:05:00.680> annoys<00:05:01.009> me

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
his release clause which annoys me

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.189 
his release clause which annoys me
because<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.699> don't<00:05:02.449> see<00:05:02.599> why<00:05:02.720> our<00:05:02.870> son<00:05:03.020> wouldn't

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
because I don't see why our son wouldn't

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.510 
because I don't see why our son wouldn't
just<00:05:03.380> pay<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.650> twenty<00:05:03.919> eight<00:05:04.009> and<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.130> half<00:05:04.190> mil

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
just pay the twenty eight and a half mil

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.010 
just pay the twenty eight and a half mil
I'm<00:05:04.639> sure<00:05:04.819> he'd<00:05:05.000> preferred<00:05:05.389> to<00:05:05.539> go<00:05:05.659> to<00:05:05.720> Bayern

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
I'm sure he'd preferred to go to Bayern

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.320 
I'm sure he'd preferred to go to Bayern
