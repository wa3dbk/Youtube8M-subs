 actually with the essence of the ballet 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 has on it which cultural 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 meaningfulness comes to him and which ones 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.930
 possibly communicative function of this 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.270
 dance is inherent and whom can one this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.199
 dancers and their artistic 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.420
 Educational leaders so we have that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.039

 The ballet is prescribed for perfection 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.990
 is not there to show what I can do 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.490
 but to tell a story 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.490
 to pass on feelings 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.770
 to become one with oneself that is 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.299
 much more personal we do not do that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:45.009
 To look good just try the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.009

 and accessibility are included 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:52.690
 programmatic for the group numerous 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.510
 projects of the federal youth ballet 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.130
 again and again embody this thought

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.860
 Aesthetic experiments in new and 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.739
 worn unusual environments 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.170
 For example, the group performed in may 2012 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.600
 the inmates of the jva rottenburg 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.100

 the national youth ballet their 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.760
 a combination of cabaret music and 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.760
 graceful dance 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.390
 but also daily physical training 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.810
 Wear and enormous power pressure 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.610
 just belong to the life of a dancer 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.769
 in the ballet the competition is over 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.519
 not infrequently, the best are extreme 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.709
 trains 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.800
 I've already heard stories 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.050
 that they are important to so easy 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.510
 that they glass each other in the 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.010
 lace shoes have done so they 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.000
 no longer can dance the role or 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.169
 or somehow the costume 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.610
 have zipper cut that 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.830
 they can not close that before the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.370
 But I have to say this here 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.100
 bundesjugendorchester of it 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.900
 we understand each other so well 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.280
 a group is almost a part of it 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.280
 indescribably beautiful actually 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.530
 for maurice the two years end at 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.320
 Federal Youth Ballet in the coming 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.870
 Only then will it become apparent 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.760
 he too in the highly competitive world of 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.090
