hacking<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.809> competitive<00:00:10.200> hacking

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
hacking so it's a competitive hacking

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.089 
hacking so it's a competitive hacking
game<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.550> hackers<00:00:12.139> basically<00:00:13.139> get<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.440> attack

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
game to hackers basically get to attack

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.460 
game to hackers basically get to attack
each<00:00:14.309> other<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:15.240> cyber<00:00:15.540> attacks<00:00:15.870> there's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
each other with cyber attacks there's

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.500 
each other with cyber attacks there's
viruses<00:00:17.070> there's<00:00:17.369> children's<00:00:17.910> there's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
viruses there's children's there's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.120 
viruses there's children's there's
firewalls<00:00:19.140> there's<00:00:19.380> encryption<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:19.980> all

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
firewalls there's encryption so all

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.439 
firewalls there's encryption so all
these<00:00:20.250> different<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.699> offensive<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
these different like offensive and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.599 
these different like offensive and
defensive<00:00:21.840> powers<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.800> basically<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
defensive powers and so basically you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.960 
defensive powers and so basically you
start<00:00:23.670> capturing<00:00:24.359> nodes<00:00:24.750> one<00:00:25.019> by<00:00:25.140> one<00:00:25.340> but<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
start capturing nodes one by one but you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.730 
start capturing nodes one by one but you
always<00:00:27.300> want<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> try<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> break<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> enemy

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
always want to try to break the enemy

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.919 
always want to try to break the enemy
network<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.189> smaller<00:00:29.400> pieces<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:30.779> can

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
network into smaller pieces you can

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.089 
network into smaller pieces you can
disconnect<00:00:31.289> nodes<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.679> way<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> can

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
disconnect nodes that way you can

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.229 
disconnect nodes that way you can
capture<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.489> pasture<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.030> got<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.180> be

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
capture them pasture so you got to be

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
capture them pasture so you got to be
very<00:00:33.270> strategic<00:00:33.570> about<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.800> notes<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
very strategic about what notes you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
very strategic about what notes you
leave<00:00:35.370> isolated<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.600> about

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
leave isolated and how you go about

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.930 
leave isolated and how you go about
attacking<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.500> i'm<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> encrypt<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
attacking think i'm going to encrypt a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.010 
attacking think i'm going to encrypt a
know<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> makes<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> harder<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
know there that makes it harder to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.380 
know there that makes it harder to
attack<00:00:40.440> i'm<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> try<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> isolate<00:00:42.000> these

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
attack i'm going to try to isolate these

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
attack i'm going to try to isolate these
two<00:00:42.629> red<00:00:42.809> nodes<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.350> i<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:44.250> capture<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.700> in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
two red nodes here i can capture them in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670 
two red nodes here i can capture them in
time<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.719> go<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:45.960> turn<00:00:46.140> dark<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.530> can

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
time there you go they turn dark i can

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.650 
time there you go they turn dark i can
now<00:00:46.770> grab<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.190> i'm<00:00:47.789> launching<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.210> spike<00:00:48.510> at

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
now grab them i'm launching a spike at

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
now grab them i'm launching a spike at
the<00:00:48.750> enemy<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.559> temporarily<00:00:49.860> disable

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the enemy that will temporarily disable

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.979 
the enemy that will temporarily disable
several<00:00:50.730> nodes<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> keep

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
several nodes and so you kind of keep

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.420 
several nodes and so you kind of keep
going<00:00:52.199> back<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.379> forth<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> real<00:00:53.219> time

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
going back and forth it's a real time

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.150 
going back and forth it's a real time
strategy<00:00:53.940> game<00:00:54.410> there's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> whole<00:00:55.739> campaign

example he's getting close to buildings

grooves and the really interesting thing

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.470 
grooves and the really interesting thing
I<00:03:38.200> think<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.489> entire<00:03:39.790> level<00:03:40.120> is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
I think is that the entire level is

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.870 
I think is that the entire level is
created<00:03:41.019> from<00:03:41.140> your<00:03:41.350> music<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.400> for<00:03:42.850> example

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
created from your music so for example

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.930 
created from your music so for example
if<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.570> play<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.080> yo<00:03:44.380> do<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.830> like<00:03:44.980> Enya<00:03:45.280> all

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
if you play and yo do you like Enya all

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.210 
if you play and yo do you like Enya all
right<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.780> get<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.989> relaxing<00:03:47.590> level<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.130> you

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
right you get a relaxing level and you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.830 
right you get a relaxing level and you
if<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.459> play<00:03:48.640> something<00:03:48.970> like<00:03:49.000> Skrillex<00:03:49.690> you

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
if you play something like Skrillex you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.390 
if you play something like Skrillex you
get<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.019> level<00:03:50.260> like<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.739> which<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.070> crazy

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
get a level like this which is crazy

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.940 
get a level like this which is crazy
right<00:03:51.850> now<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:52.840> we're<00:03:53.019> listening<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.650> I
