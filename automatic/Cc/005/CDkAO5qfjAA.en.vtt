00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.369
 two weeks anyway that I'm 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.709

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.810

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:24.459
 video every weekend so that's what 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.700
 I intend to do so for the moment 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.929
 until the holidays anyway but the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.179
 last weekend I could not do it 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.110
 because I had too many homework I 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.450
 have not had time to make the video you have 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.429
 been several brought them to me I was 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.500
 claimed the video is asked why 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.880
 I had not put a good one you were 2 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 but you have to start with a 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 little figure is 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.170
 you asked me subscriber challenges 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.950
 so these challenges are in the process of 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.229
 production 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.740
 I talked to my team 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.520
 do with them so if you ever 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.320
 do I want to make a challenge that I do not have 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.640

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.920
 will do as soon as possible 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.370
 not for the moment as soon as possible 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.420
 so I'll do it to you the challenges that - 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.260
 already been proposed are 10 20 or 30 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.459
 sleeves with the magic box saying 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.880
 to the 30 innings that with the weapons on the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.250
 wall on match match for the challenge of the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:37.540
 magic box and 30 sleeves surgery there 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:42.760
 and 30 innings on nash orders and so 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:47.349
 these challenges are achievement but good 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.980
 so if ever you are wise you 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.560

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.060

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.060
 me that I recorded by what we 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.769

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.209

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.609

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:10.120

 which is also very nice and 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:21.100
 very funny so this video and when a 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.840
 not very short but I wanted you 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.220
 to make one and I confess that when 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 even dry in gameplay 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.380
 I do not have the opportunity to 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.200

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.489
