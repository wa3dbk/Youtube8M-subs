00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.049 

so<00:00:06.319> today<00:00:06.680> we're<00:00:06.950> going<00:00:07.130> to<00:00:07.220> be<00:00:07.340> benchmarking

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
so today we're going to be benchmarking

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.780 
so today we're going to be benchmarking
the<00:00:08.240> new<00:00:08.480> macbook<00:00:08.780> pro<00:00:09.320> retina<00:00:09.370> so<00:00:10.370> this<00:00:10.610> one's

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
the new macbook pro retina so this one's

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.089 
the new macbook pro retina so this one's
rocking<00:00:11.120> a<00:00:11.180> 256<00:00:12.110> gigabyte<00:00:12.530> hard<00:00:12.650> drive<00:00:12.769> so

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
rocking a 256 gigabyte hard drive so

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.499 
rocking a 256 gigabyte hard drive so
let's<00:00:13.130> go<00:00:13.370> ahead<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:13.639> start<00:00:13.880> this<00:00:14.059> off<00:00:14.240> with<00:00:14.269> a

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
let's go ahead and start this off with a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.350 
let's go ahead and start this off with a
boot<00:00:14.750> test<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:19.160> essentially<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.849> startup

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
boot test so essentially the startup

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.760 
boot test so essentially the startup
starts<00:00:20.750> when<00:00:20.900> you<00:00:20.990> see<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.289> actual<00:00:21.529> apple

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
starts when you see the actual apple

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.890 
starts when you see the actual apple
logo<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:22.670> anyways<00:00:23.029> we'll<00:00:23.240> just<00:00:23.449> have<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.750> in

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
logo but anyways we'll just have it in

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.570 
logo but anyways we'll just have it in
there<00:00:24.080> just<00:00:24.350> to<00:00:24.470> see<00:00:24.619> from<00:00:24.830> start<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.250> finish

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
there just to see from start to finish

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.460 
there just to see from start to finish
this<00:00:26.000> doesn't<00:00:26.390> take<00:00:26.539> very<00:00:26.689> long<00:00:26.840> and<00:00:27.230> this<00:00:27.289> is

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
this doesn't take very long and this is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.560 
this doesn't take very long and this is
due<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.769> new<00:00:28.010> solid<00:00:28.460> state<00:00:28.760> technology<00:00:28.939> in

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
due to the new solid state technology in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.720 
due to the new solid state technology in
the<00:00:29.660> new<00:00:29.840> macbook<00:00:30.080> pro<00:00:30.439> retina<00:00:33.550> so<00:00:34.550> there<00:00:34.699> you

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
the new macbook pro retina so there you

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.670 
the new macbook pro retina so there you
can<00:00:34.910> see<00:00:34.940> about<00:00:35.330> 15<00:00:35.750> seconds<00:00:36.140> we'll<00:00:36.350> just<00:00:36.530> say

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
can see about 15 seconds we'll just say

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.430 
can see about 15 seconds we'll just say
16.5<00:00:37.580> that<00:00:38.089> is<00:00:38.239> extremely<00:00:38.750> fast<00:00:39.140> for<00:00:39.409> a

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
16.5 that is extremely fast for a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.649 
16.5 that is extremely fast for a
computer<00:00:39.799> and<00:00:40.100> now<00:00:40.580> this<00:00:40.629> computer<00:00:41.629> is

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
computer and now this computer is

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.259 
computer and now this computer is
actually<00:00:41.930> rocking<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.350> quad-core<00:00:42.799> i7<00:00:43.309> two

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
actually rocking a quad-core i7 two

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.180 
actually rocking a quad-core i7 two

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
to three point three gigahertz and this

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.100 
to three point three gigahertz and this
computer<00:00:49.699> is<00:00:49.729> really<00:00:49.970> great<00:00:50.269> and<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.930> also

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
computer is really great and I also

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.990 
computer is really great and I also
custom<00:00:51.589> configure<00:00:51.979> this<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.309> have<00:00:52.489> 16

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
custom configure this to have 16

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.539 
custom configure this to have 16
gigabytes<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:53.510> RAM<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:55.010> we're<00:00:55.159> going<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.519> start

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
gigabytes of RAM so we're going to start

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.820 
gigabytes of RAM so we're going to start
off<00:00:55.970> with<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.299> Geekbench<00:00:56.720> so<00:00:57.290> right<00:00:57.500> here<00:00:57.739> we

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
off with the Geekbench so right here we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.039 
off with the Geekbench so right here we
have<00:00:57.949> geekbench<00:00:58.400> 64-bit<00:00:59.299> so<00:00:59.720> let's<00:00:59.900> go<00:01:00.019> ahead

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
have geekbench 64-bit so let's go ahead

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.539 
have geekbench 64-bit so let's go ahead
and<00:01:00.199> load<00:01:00.470> that<00:01:00.619> up<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:04.040> we're<00:01:04.159> just<00:01:04.189> going<00:01:04.519> to

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
and load that up so we're just going to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.130 
and load that up so we're just going to
go<00:01:04.699> ahead<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.059> click<00:01:05.269> run<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.840> can<00:01:05.990> see<00:01:06.110> that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
go ahead and click run you can see that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.670 
go ahead and click run you can see that
this<00:01:06.409> is<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.710> mac<00:01:06.890> OS<00:01:07.250> x<00:01:07.479> 64<00:01:08.479> bit<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.500> is

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
this is the mac OS x 64 bit and this is

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.430 
this is the mac OS x 64 bit and this is

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
gigs ram in 10 point 7.4 we'll go ahead

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.350 
gigs ram in 10 point 7.4 we'll go ahead
and<00:01:15.410> click<00:01:15.680> run<00:01:15.980> and<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.700> should<00:01:16.940> not<00:01:17.120> take

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
and click run and this should not take

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.540 
and click run and this should not take
very<00:01:17.420> long<00:01:17.780> at<00:01:17.840> all<00:01:18.050> so<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.070> comes<00:01:19.280> out<00:01:19.430> with

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
very long at all so this comes out with

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.640 
very long at all so this comes out with
a<00:01:19.580> really<00:01:20.030> great<00:01:20.240> geekbench<00:01:20.720> score<00:01:20.810> you

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
a really great geekbench score you

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.870 
a really great geekbench score you
really<00:01:21.890> have<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.130> be<00:01:22.160> familiar<00:01:22.820> with

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
really have to be familiar with

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.880 
really have to be familiar with
geekbench<00:01:23.450> score<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:23.930> really<00:01:24.260> anything<00:01:24.530> over

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
geekbench score but really anything over

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.289 
geekbench score but really anything over
10,000<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.610> pretty<00:01:25.970> good

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.340 

so<00:01:33.299> right<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.289> have

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
so right there we see that we have

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.590 
so right there we see that we have
12,000<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.149> mac<00:01:36.359> mini

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
12,000 and I think that my mac mini

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
12,000 and I think that my mac mini
server<00:01:36.929> with<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> quad-core<00:01:37.530> i7<00:01:37.799> assault<00:01:38.789> stay

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
server with a quad-core i7 assault stay

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.599 
server with a quad-core i7 assault stay
500<00:01:39.659> gigs<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.319> storage<00:01:40.469> space<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.399> that

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
500 gigs of storage space and all that

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.059 
500 gigs of storage space and all that
good<00:01:41.789> stuff<00:01:41.850> gets<00:01:42.780> around<00:01:42.960> 10,000<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.859> this

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
good stuff gets around 10,000 so this

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.039 
good stuff gets around 10,000 so this
new<00:01:44.219> macbook<00:01:44.579> pro<00:01:44.759> has<00:01:44.969> quite<00:01:45.240> an<00:01:45.420> edge<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
new macbook pro has quite an edge and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.840 
new macbook pro has quite an edge and
this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> laptop<00:01:47.069> for<00:01:47.250> snap<00:01:47.490> being<00:01:47.729> in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
this is a laptop for snap being in

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
this is a laptop for snap being in
desktop<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.380> we're<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:50.009> ahead

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
desktop so now we're going to go ahead

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
desktop so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:50.280> try<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.939> Nova<00:01:51.270> bench<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.719> see

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and try with Nova bench you can see

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.300 
and try with Nova bench you can see
right<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.469> we're<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.069> click

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
right here so we're just going to click

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
right here so we're just going to click
right<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.049> load

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
right here and now this is going to load
up<00:01:55.409> with<00:01:55.590> Nova<00:01:55.950> bench<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.609> is<00:01:56.700> another

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
up with Nova bench this is another

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
up with Nova bench this is another
geekbench<00:01:57.539> kind<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.959> thing<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.530> we're<00:01:58.979> just

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
geekbench kind of thing and we're just

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.740 
geekbench kind of thing and we're just
going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.429> go<00:01:59.609> ahead<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> start<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.479> tests

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
going to go ahead and start some tests

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
going to go ahead and start some tests
this<00:02:01.679> is<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.039> for<00:02:02.159> other<00:02:02.340> people<00:02:02.700> who<00:02:02.819> use

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
this is just for other people who use

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.419 
this is just for other people who use
this<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.479> more<00:02:03.599> familiar<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
this and more familiar with this this is

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.100 
this and more familiar with this this is
just<00:02:05.789> another<00:02:06.030> program<00:02:06.599> just<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> show<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
just another program just to show you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.620 
just another program just to show you
that<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.560> constant<00:02:08.399> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.759> thing<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.539> I'm

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
that my constant kind of thing so I'm

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.360 
that my constant kind of thing so I'm
not<00:02:09.750> too<00:02:09.899> familiar<00:02:10.079> with<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> scores<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.099> am

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
not too familiar with the scores this am

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610 
not too familiar with the scores this am
with<00:02:11.549> geekbench<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.019> just<00:02:13.049> again

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
with geekbench but this is just again

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:32.250 
with geekbench but this is just again
the<00:02:13.890> same<00:02:14.130> thing<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.549> geekbench

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.910 

so<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.590> see<00:02:33.769> that<00:02:33.980> we<00:02:34.099> have<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.280> score<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:35.920> 1165

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
so we see that we have a score of 1165

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.459 
so we see that we have a score of 1165
I'm<00:02:37.849> not<00:02:38.030> too<00:02:38.359> sure<00:02:38.569> what<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.900> compare<00:02:39.079> to

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
I'm not too sure what to compare to

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.629 
I'm not too sure what to compare to
let's<00:02:39.709> go<00:02:39.829> ahead<00:02:39.889> and<00:02:39.980> click<00:02:40.249> Submit<00:02:40.609> and

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
let's go ahead and click Submit and

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.660 
let's go ahead and click Submit and
compare<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:41.989> looks<00:02:42.049> like<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.439> top<00:02:42.829> scores

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
compare so it looks like the top scores

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.410 
compare so it looks like the top scores
on<00:02:43.909> nova<00:02:44.569> benches<00:02:45.040> 2922<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.939> that<00:02:47.090> means<00:02:47.269> that

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
on nova benches 2922 so that means that

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.899 
on nova benches 2922 so that means that
this<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.719> coming<00:02:48.019> in<00:02:48.139> pretty<00:02:48.650> good<00:02:48.909> some

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
this is coming in pretty good some

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.690 
this is coming in pretty good some
scores<00:02:50.269> go<00:02:50.420> down<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.989> like<00:02:51.109> 500<00:02:51.709> but<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.639> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
scores go down to like 500 but this is a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.369 
scores go down to like 500 but this is a
pretty<00:02:52.909> good<00:02:53.090> score<00:02:53.389> and<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:53.810> saw<00:02:53.959> tests

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
pretty good score and this saw tests

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.740 
pretty good score and this saw tests
really<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.920> ram<00:02:55.159> cpu<00:02:55.549> graphics<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.480> all<00:02:56.569> that

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
really the ram cpu graphics and all that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.050 
really the ram cpu graphics and all that
good<00:02:56.930> stuff<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.439> also<00:02:57.950> chest<00:02:58.370> checks<00:02:58.849> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
good stuff and also chest checks the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.569 
good stuff and also chest checks the
solid-state<00:02:59.810> drive<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.769> last<00:03:01.010> test<00:03:01.310> we<00:03:01.489> were

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
solid-state drive the last test we were

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.129 
solid-state drive the last test we were
going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.879> run<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.510> black<00:03:02.689> magic

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
going to run is with the black magic

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.959 
going to run is with the black magic
speed<00:03:03.409> test<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.129> let's<00:03:04.340> go<00:03:04.459> ahead<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.669> open

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
speed test so let's go ahead and open

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.420 
speed test so let's go ahead and open
that<00:03:05.000> up<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:05.419> this<00:03:05.569> will<00:03:05.780> test<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.230> full<00:03:06.500> SSD

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
that up and this will test the full SSD

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
that up and this will test the full SSD
speed<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.299> this<00:03:08.449> will<00:03:08.629> tell<00:03:08.870> us<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:09.290> numbers

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
speed so this will tell us in numbers

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.250 
speed so this will tell us in numbers
what<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.549> actual<00:03:10.819> speed<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:11.870> all<00:03:12.109> we<00:03:12.230> have

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
what the actual speed is so all we have

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.170 
what the actual speed is so all we have
to<00:03:12.379> do<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:12.889> click<00:03:13.010> speed<00:03:13.400> test<00:03:13.669> start<00:03:13.969> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
to do is just click speed test start and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.819 
to do is just click speed test start and
we'll<00:03:14.389> go<00:03:14.540> ahead<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:14.750> give<00:03:14.900> us<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.230> number<00:03:15.379> for

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
we'll go ahead and give us a number for

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.839 
we'll go ahead and give us a number for
how<00:03:16.189> fast<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.609> SD<00:03:17.120> really<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.579> right

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
how fast this SD really is so right

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.750 
how fast this SD really is so right
we're<00:03:20.030> coming<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.419> at<00:03:20.629> 40<00:03:21.019> seven<00:03:21.560> ish<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.069> read

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
we're coming in at 40 seven ish and read

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.539 
we're coming in at 40 seven ish and read
we<00:03:23.060> are<00:03:23.180> going<00:03:23.449> all<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:23.719> way<00:03:23.810> up<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.019> 4<00:03:24.439> 48<00:03:24.889> kind

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
we are going all the way up to 4 48 kind

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.509 
we are going all the way up to 4 48 kind
of<00:03:25.669> maxing<00:03:26.090> out<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.569> little<00:03:26.780> radar<00:03:27.319> thing<00:03:27.680> so

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
of maxing out this little radar thing so

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.920 
of maxing out this little radar thing so
it's<00:03:28.939> supposed<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.389> up<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.689> five<00:03:29.900> hundred

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
it's supposed to have up to five hundred

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.069 
it's supposed to have up to five hundred
megabytes<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.760> dispute<00:03:32.540> test<00:03:32.719> is<00:03:32.870> pretty

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
megabytes so this dispute test is pretty

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.199 
megabytes so this dispute test is pretty
accurate<00:03:33.230> usually<00:03:34.069> SSDs<00:03:34.519> fall<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.819> little<00:03:35.000> bit

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
accurate usually SSDs fall a little bit

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.740 
accurate usually SSDs fall a little bit
short<00:03:35.509> of<00:03:35.689> what<00:03:35.989> they<00:03:36.470> actually<00:03:36.650> are<00:03:36.889> in<00:03:37.459> a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
short of what they actually are in a

definitely<00:03:43.159> like<00:03:43.759> the<00:03:43.790> new<00:03:44.090> Retina<00:03:44.900> display

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
definitely like the new Retina display

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.649 
definitely like the new Retina display
and<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:46.009> performance<00:03:46.699> from<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.180> amazing
