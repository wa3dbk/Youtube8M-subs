00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
they've got desert everywhere so I'm

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
hoping that it's not just for desert

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
hoping that it's not just for desert
because<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:32.099> remember<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.820> red<00:00:32.969> dead

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
because as remember in red dead

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.959 
because as remember in red dead
redemption<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:34.260> desert<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.730> boring

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
redemption the desert was really boring

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.090 
redemption the desert was really boring
sometimes<00:00:36.360> walking<00:00:36.930> through<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.980> was

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sometimes walking through it but it was

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680 
sometimes walking through it but it was
great<00:00:38.309> landscape<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.090> looked<00:00:39.390> absolutely

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
great landscape it looked absolutely

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
great landscape it looked absolutely
brilliant<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.489> walking

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
brilliant but it was just like walking

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
brilliant but it was just like walking
through<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> same<00:00:42.840> desert<00:00:43.170> over<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> over

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
through the same desert over and over

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.049 
through the same desert over and over
again<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.280> hopefully<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
again so hopefully it's not like that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
again so hopefully it's not like that
map<00:00:45.570> size<00:00:45.840> does<00:00:46.230> include<00:00:46.500> interiors<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.309> what

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
map size does include interiors as what

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.580 
map size does include interiors as what
might<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> same<00:00:48.059> size<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.870> savoring<00:00:49.379> dead

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
might be the same size is savoring dead

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
might be the same size is savoring dead
redemption<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> has<00:00:50.550> interiors<00:00:51.180> for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
explained it much more but they were all

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.000 
explained it much more but they were all
dynamically<00:04:02.750> have<00:04:02.930> our<00:04:03.079> own<00:04:03.199> lives<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:03.680> when

I really quite cautious
how<00:04:24.840> they've<00:04:24.990> implemented<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.680> whole

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
how they've implemented the whole

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.040 
how they've implemented the whole
drop-down<00:04:26.250> feature<00:04:26.550> because<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.600> strongly

between<00:04:29.670> cars<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.810> was<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> quite<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> cool

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
between cars and that was a quite a cool

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.990 
between cars and that was a quite a cool
way<00:04:31.710> door<00:04:31.980> so<00:04:32.190> if<00:04:32.280> they<00:04:32.370> were<00:04:32.430> implanted<00:04:32.970> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
way door so if they were implanted that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.420 
way door so if they were implanted that
kind<00:04:33.390> of<00:04:33.450> thing<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.870> would<00:04:34.320> be<00:04:34.680> cool<00:04:34.920> because

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
kind of thing that would be cool because

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.880 
kind of thing that would be cool because
it<00:04:35.940> was<00:04:36.150> very<00:04:36.420> fluid<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.990> very<00:04:37.230> dynamic<00:04:37.770> and

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
it was very fluid and very dynamic and

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.650 
it was very fluid and very dynamic and
apparently<00:04:38.820> as<00:04:39.060> they<00:04:39.270> send<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.510> article

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
apparently as they send the article

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.260 
apparently as they send the article
ideas<00:04:40.080> like<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.380> but<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.490> can't<00:04:41.850> really<00:04:42.060> trust

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
ideas like that but I can't really trust

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.930 
ideas like that but I can't really trust
the<00:04:42.450> article<00:04:42.980> opinions<00:04:43.980> because<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.760> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
the article opinions because it is the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.480 
the article opinions because it is the
article<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:46.380> article<00:04:46.620> was<00:04:46.770> probably

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
article and the article was probably

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.750 
article and the article was probably
paid<00:04:47.820> for<00:04:48.060> by<00:04:48.240> Rockstar<00:04:48.840> gonna<00:04:49.620> be<00:04:49.920> honest<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
paid for by Rockstar gonna be honest and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.010 
paid for by Rockstar gonna be honest and
those<00:04:50.970> are<00:04:51.000> two<00:04:51.300> things<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.570> really<00:04:51.690> wanted<00:04:51.930> a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
those are two things I really wanted a

franchise<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.550> since<00:05:09.270> GTA<00:05:10.010> 4<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.310> lot<00:05:11.970> has

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
franchise and since GTA 4 a lot has

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.880 
franchise and since GTA 4 a lot has
happened<00:05:12.660> had<00:05:13.020> red<00:05:13.200> dead<00:05:13.350> redemption<00:05:13.470> which

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
happened had red dead redemption which

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.430 
happened had red dead redemption which
has<00:05:14.040> been<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.370> best<00:05:14.610> game<00:05:14.970> i<00:05:15.150> think<00:05:15.690> that

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
has been the best game i think that

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.790 
has been the best game i think that
Rockstar<00:05:16.860> have<00:05:16.950> made<00:05:17.160> since<00:05:17.730> GTA<00:05:18.210> 4<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.020> I

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
Rockstar have made since GTA 4 and I

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.080 
Rockstar have made since GTA 4 and I
think<00:05:19.860> that<00:05:20.190> they've<00:05:20.400> taken<00:05:20.669> what<00:05:20.940> they've

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
think that they've taken what they've

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.420 
think that they've taken what they've
learned<00:05:21.360> from<00:05:21.570> GTA<00:05:22.050> 4<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.740> they<00:05:22.890> have<00:05:23.010> said<00:05:23.220> so

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
learned from GTA 4 and they have said so

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.680 
learned from GTA 4 and they have said so
that<00:05:23.820> there<00:05:23.970> is<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> lot<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.300> things<00:05:24.450> to<00:05:24.570> do

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
that there is a lot of things to do

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.030 
that there is a lot of things to do
today<00:05:24.720> for<00:05:25.080> they<00:05:25.169> would<00:05:25.290> have<00:05:25.380> changed<00:05:25.620> as

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
today for they would have changed as

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.310 
today for they would have changed as
they<00:05:26.400> had<00:05:26.580> they<00:05:26.669> done<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:26.970> now<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.290> really

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
they had they done it now and I really

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.260 
they had they done it now and I really
think<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.770> they've<00:05:29.220> come<00:05:29.610> from<00:05:29.850> that<00:05:30.090> and

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
think that they've come from that and

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.460 
think that they've come from that and
being<00:05:30.390> like<00:05:30.479> okay<00:05:30.840> we<00:05:30.990> can<00:05:31.110> change<00:05:31.290> this

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
being like okay we can change this

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.210 
being like okay we can change this
business<00:05:31.860> because<00:05:32.280> as<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.820> said<00:05:32.880> there<00:05:33.450> are<00:05:33.720> no

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
business because as I said there are no

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.000 
business because as I said there are no
bowling<00:05:35.220> missions<00:05:35.970> or<00:05:36.180> romance<00:05:36.930> they've<00:05:37.860> got

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
bowling missions or romance they've got

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.230 
bowling missions or romance they've got
no<00:05:38.130> time<00:05:38.310> for<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.669> characters<00:05:39.030> don't

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
no time for that the characters don't

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.730 
no time for that the characters don't
have<00:05:39.510> time<00:05:39.690> for<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:39.930> so<00:05:40.140> why<00:05:40.320> is<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:40.500> in
