00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.690
 first via orazio 73 napoli veneroso 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.599
 motorcycle tires and in Naples in via piedigrotta 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.099
 21 22 bikes and motorbikes at 100 meters from 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.099
 toll bypass exit 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 the name versys is an acronym for 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.089
 versailles t systems and the bike seen from 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.659
 firm seems ready for any kind of 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.519
 utilization 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.469
 the first thing certain is that this 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.350
 kawasaki evolves into a key on the road 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.449
 dna of the chapels and 500 that remains 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 still on the price list but now seems ready 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.750
 Pass the witness 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.789
 the most original element without doubt the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 fairing that ends with a curious lighthouse 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.119
 in the shape of a mushroom dominated by a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.020
 small adjustable windshield on three 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.789
 positions 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.280
 behind him is an instrumentation 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.350
 composed of an analogue tachometer from 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.060
 a large number of spies and from a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.009
 digital display that from all the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 indications of the case the whole the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.300
 fairing tank almost runs out of 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.490
 only the bodywork chapter definitely 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 tight the side panels and the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 sheaf have a minimalist look like 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.580
 these radiator conveyors 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 parts are all plastic like the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.690
 shell that protects the engine from shocks 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.250
 to fill the apparent void I am in 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.350
 many technical components with a look 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.209
 sought after first of all the long 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 asymmetrical aluminum swingarm 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.759
 straight with reinforced truss on 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.080
 left side banana on the right side 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.090
 decentralized from the same part makes beautiful 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.129
 also shows the shock one is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.319
 adjustable in spring preload and in 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.149
 hydraulic brake in extension 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.369
 the braking system is operated by caliper a 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.039
 double tokico piston that bite one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.229
 pair of 300 mm daisy disks 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.810
 the same square footage also characterizes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.640
 the 220 mm rear disc on which 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.220
 works a single-piston caliper 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.560
 the wheels are both 17-inch and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.800
 fit tires 120 70 to the front 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.680
 and 160 60 at the rear 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.400
 the engine we know is that of the r6 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.930
 n if 50 parallel twin that is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.819
 it has been a little sweetened, it has worked 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.019
 on mapping and will be done so that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.150
 if it had a fluid supply a 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.670
 joining jim and gestation in fact starting 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.280
 from 1500 up to 7,000 on the bike 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.920
 it is very ready and even if you are with one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.459
 extra gear always pulls the fork 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.150
 finally I would say we find one 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.489
 stems of 41 mm no longer the classic 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.409
 then stems upside down and we see that the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.830
 lantern much more solid than 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.170
 how much was on 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.930
 36 and also on the z 750 that this year 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.450
 with 2007 it also conquered the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.340
 fork with other upside down stems 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.730
 consideration regarding aesthetics 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.180
 I would like to do it on the platforms we find the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.010
 rubber pads on the rider pads is much more 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.100
 comfortable and then for what 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.780
 concerns possible for the passenger 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.210
 the line of the rn has been abandoned a little 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.480
 that he had this band that continued 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.700
 here with the front platform to the man in 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.530
 place of the tour of the structure in 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.290
 tube in pylons that now houses 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.550
 just the rear platform the frame a 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.000
 round tubes keeps the same 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.950
 r6 msf architecture apart from 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.720
 auxiliary frame that strengthens the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.360
 back for the joy of those who dedicate themselves 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.250
 to exceptional transport as anticipated 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.209
 the control unit a different mapping that 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.010
 also takes into account the new one 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.110
 indispensable catalyst for 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.540
 fall within euro 3 parameters 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.470
 the maximum power is now 64 horses a 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.360
 8000 rpm against the 72 of the two is r6 la 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.280
 renunciation of absolute power pays on 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.320
 front of the torque curve that is made 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.040
 more robust in the range of 4,000 e 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.739
 6,000 200 laps and a peak of 6.2 kg m 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.000
 at 6,800 rpm for novice drivers e 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.739
 a reduced version is also planned 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.739
 from 25 kilowatts 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.590
 the engine is very sweet in his 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.800
 power delivery let us remember that 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.290
 are 65 horses that this 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.300
 twin cylinder can generate mapping is 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.430
 been designed so that at each 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.990
 rotation speed from 1,500 to rise 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.750
 out of 7,000 both the couple is present 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.650
 full-bodied and as we also said with one 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.140
 extra gear 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.600
 it is resumed that it is a pleasure to tend 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.040
 a bit to wall up too early in the sense 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.370
 that obviously his twin 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.500
 limits 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.440
 he has them but he wouldn't have minded 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.200
 have that thousand spins more than that 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.450
 could make up to 8,000 9,000 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.530
 turns for what concerns the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.960
 cycling we had said 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.930
 the suspensions are a little too soft 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.140
 of series we remember that the fork can 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.850
 be adjusted of the damping in 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.350
 continuous and in preload 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.300
 so this is one more element that 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.270
 can maybe give us the chance to 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.580
 soften or stiffen the front end 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.640
 last consideration I want to make it from 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.810
 kawasaki enthusiast and is a criticism 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.870
 to the invoice of the mirrors that it is 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.790
 always the mole of huge kawasaki 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.430
 televisions that will definitely give 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.630
 excellent visibility to what happens 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.540
 behind, however, maybe they are a little too much 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.790
 big is just the first item to be 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.790
 replace with aftermarket products
