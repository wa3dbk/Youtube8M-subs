warlocks are the only ones that have
dark<00:01:39.390> intent<00:01:39.979> what<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> mean<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> this

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
dark intent what I mean and this is this

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
dark intent what I mean and this is this
is<00:01:42.000> pretty<00:01:42.240> obvious<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.720> mean<00:01:42.840> shamans<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is pretty obvious I mean shamans are the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.760 
is pretty obvious I mean shamans are the
only<00:01:43.740> ones<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.130> bloodlust<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.770> mages

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
only ones that have bloodlust but mages

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.469 
only ones that have bloodlust but mages
have<00:01:46.890> time<00:01:47.100> work<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.490> time<00:01:47.850> warp<00:01:48.119> literally

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have time work and time warp literally

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.929 
have time work and time warp literally
is<00:01:48.720> bloodlust<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.610> don't<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
is bloodlust so if you don't have a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
is bloodlust so if you don't have a
shaman<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.600> still<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> mage<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.979> if

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
shaman you can still have a mage but if

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.520 
shaman you can still have a mage but if
you<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> warlock<00:01:54.299> well<00:01:55.049> you're

as hard as a brand new sock so to me

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.830 
as hard as a brand new sock so to me
this<00:03:20.280> buff<00:03:20.520> feels<00:03:20.790> necessary<00:03:21.000> because<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
this buff feels necessary because the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.180 
this buff feels necessary because the
fellow<00:03:22.110> hunter<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> intended<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.100> be

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.700 
other hand shadow mastery that change
seems<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.900> puts<00:03:28.080> affliction<00:03:28.470> even

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
seems like it puts affliction even

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.770 
seems like it puts affliction even
further<00:03:28.980> ahead<00:03:29.220> when<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.030> didn't<00:03:30.390> really<00:03:30.540> need

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780
