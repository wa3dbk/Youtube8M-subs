00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
thing I wanted in this controller was

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
thing I wanted in this controller was
BMO<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.469> he's<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.680> favorite<00:00:59.129> character

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240 
just buy controller from the website and
the<00:01:36.780> designer<00:01:37.079> will<00:01:37.290> paint<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.829> send<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the designer will paint it and send it

to you without you doing anything and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.590 
to you without you doing anything and
that<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.259> little<00:01:43.259> more<00:01:43.350> expensive<00:01:44.600> because

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that is a little more expensive because

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
that is a little more expensive because
you<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> pay<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> controller

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you have to pay for the controller

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.630 
you have to pay for the controller
itself<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> did<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.250> had<00:01:50.549> the
