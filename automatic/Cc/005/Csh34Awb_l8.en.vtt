00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
exciting but it's really annoying I've

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.820 
exciting but it's really annoying I've
had<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.790> sit<00:04:01.030> through<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.360> whole<00:04:01.660> day<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:02.170> people

had to sit through a whole day of people

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.120 
had to sit through a whole day of people
on<00:04:03.250> Cordero's<00:04:03.900> status<00:04:04.900> talking<00:04:05.530> about<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:06.010> on

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
cards they are not as broken as you

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.920 
cards they are not as broken as you
think<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.980> think<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.790> only<00:04:15.970> reason<00:04:16.270> that<00:04:16.690> these

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
think I think the only reason that these

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.390 
think I think the only reason that these
cards<00:04:17.200> are<00:04:17.260> going<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.440> be<00:04:17.500> good<00:04:17.709> or<00:04:17.920> what<00:04:18.190> other

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
cards are going to be good or what other

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.370 
cards are going to be good or what other
deck<00:04:18.790> they're<00:04:19.000> going<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.180> be

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
deck they're going to be

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.130 
deck they're going to be
is<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:20.010> type<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.370> antimatter<00:04:21.090> deck<00:04:21.480> because

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
is a type of antimatter deck because

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.830 
is a type of antimatter deck because
they<00:04:22.290> are<00:04:22.410> very<00:04:22.620> antimatter<00:04:23.310> cards<00:04:24.090> they<00:04:24.690> are

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
they are very antimatter cards they are

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.990 
they are very antimatter cards they are
not<00:04:25.110> going<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.410> be<00:04:25.530> as<00:04:25.950> splash'<00:04:26.400> Balazs<00:04:26.850> you

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
not going to be as splash' Balazs you

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.570 
not going to be as splash' Balazs you
think<00:04:27.360> because<00:04:27.810> what's<00:04:28.350> real<00:04:28.770> synergy<00:04:29.310> are

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
think because what's real synergy are

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.910 
think because what's real synergy are
they<00:04:29.700> gonna<00:04:29.850> have<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.750> certain<00:04:30.960> deck<00:04:31.470> there

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
they gonna have in a certain deck there

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.040 
they gonna have in a certain deck there
are<00:04:32.040> fire<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.490> water<00:04:32.640> quite<00:04:33.210> difficult<00:04:33.480> fire

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
are fire and water quite difficult fire

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.340 
are fire and water quite difficult fire
pyro<00:04:34.590> water<00:04:35.190> aqua<00:04:35.940> they're<00:04:36.330> not<00:04:36.600> common

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
pyro water aqua they're not common

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.800 
pyro water aqua they're not common
things<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:38.280> somewhat<00:04:38.790> someone<00:04:39.150> posted<00:04:39.540> up<00:04:39.660> a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
things like somewhat someone posted up a

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.290 
things like somewhat someone posted up a
debt<00:04:40.650> profile<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.340> can<00:04:41.550> see<00:04:41.730> it<00:04:41.880> now

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
debt profile so I can see it now

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.000 
debt profile so I can see it now
they're<00:04:42.600> basically<00:04:42.780> posted<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.350> fire<00:04:43.650> fist

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
they're basically posted a fire fist

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.270 
they're basically posted a fire fist
debt<00:04:44.580> profile<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.300> then<00:04:46.170> thrown<00:04:46.590> in<00:04:46.800> just

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
debt profile and then thrown in just

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.330 
debt profile and then thrown in just
like<00:04:47.430> what<00:04:47.790> are<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:47.940> doing<00:04:48.320> don't<00:04:49.320> work<00:04:49.590> you

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
like what are you doing don't work you

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.920 
like what are you doing don't work you
can't<00:04:50.610> search<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.240> with<00:04:51.390> tanki<00:04:51.780> you're

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
can't search it with tanki you're

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.350 
can't search it with tanki you're
basically<00:04:52.380> splashing<00:04:53.040> in<00:04:53.190> for<00:04:53.490> cards<00:04:53.970> that

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
basically splashing in for cards that

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.540 
basically splashing in for cards that
have<00:04:54.510> zero<00:04:54.540> synergy<00:04:55.530> with<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.740> deck<00:04:56.070> and

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
have zero synergy with the deck and

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.100 
have zero synergy with the deck and
that's<00:04:56.790> what's<00:04:57.000> gonna<00:04:57.120> happen<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:58.050> is

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
that's what's gonna happen this is

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.810 
that's what's gonna happen this is
basically<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.920> be<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.040> new<00:04:59.280> artifact

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
basically going to be the new artifact

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.120 
basically going to be the new artifact
everyone<00:05:00.300> throws<00:05:00.480> artifacts<00:05:01.080> in<00:05:01.290> artifacts

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
everyone throws artifacts in artifacts

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.160 
everyone throws artifacts in artifacts
by<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.370> way<00:05:02.550> are<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.820> better<00:05:03.210> core<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.810> having<00:05:04.050> a

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
by the way are a better core to having a
