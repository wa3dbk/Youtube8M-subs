00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 and we continue with this crazy game 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.420
 There he tells me not to stop at that, not at 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.309
 that floor I wanted to say the bridge was 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.049
 madrid but we already learned that we do not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.210
 we stop at that but I do not believe anything 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.300
 so bad and I stand on the bridge and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.270
 that exactly they can not be 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310
 believe nothing I know that like some of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.039
 you do not know English ok 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.020
 Excellent 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.810
 let's stop in the country to have chewed 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.320
 excellent that I do not fall there what if 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 I fall there 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.850
 and we go up because I do not fall and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.850
 what 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.750
 but we learn the things that do not 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.390
 can do can you stop in the grass 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.090
 but not to treat plastic the entire center 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.880
 centered do not forget that I do not fall 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.070
 What if I fall because if I fall I 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.350
 I fall and I kill myself 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.420
 sometimes and you have to believe them 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.859
 If they are honest, they already know that 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.259
 I believe them nothing then tell me the 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.229
 true, we already know that that does not mean we 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.600
 we can stop that very well below 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.420
 is above I imagine that not by 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 down 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.960
 down all through and here that excellent 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.960
 I think that up here too 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.759
 because I think it was time to go up there 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.290
 manager I believe everything because what helps 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 the first is but if the second idiot 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:45.899
 almost but not very well although not 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.710
 always learn from your mistakes excellent 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.710
 very good 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.200
 although there we skipped flags and the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 Note note less excellent fast for 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 my people who are dying 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.650
 people do not move me good in front 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.390
 dies it is a pity the precious truth 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.090
 fast but with subtlety and a lot of care 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.190
 excellent very good that you die the same 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.200
 that before, this was the moment where 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.230
 understood all the mistakes that there were 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.840
 committed and finally learned from them in 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.970
 this moment was that he decided that he did not 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.160
 I was going to die until I got to the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 flag after that you could already give 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.269
 the freedom to die because at least 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.600
 I had achieved something that I had not achieved 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.140
 before at this time it was going to be a jump 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.330
 spectacular until you reach the top that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.330
 moves down sunken well is 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 here was the second if not that not 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.040
 very good excellent little flag banderita 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.050
 let's go fast 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.970
 not so fast you have to be careful 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.970
 we will be very good 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.740
 pure luck or what 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.740
 and what 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.970
 we believe him says stop me 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:24.300
 I do not believe him let's go for the next one 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.240
 damn they know me we 're going in is very 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.540
 well right now in the other 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.130
 I do not think these if they believe do not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.130
 because I do not believe them 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.020
 I do not believe you I do not believe you 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.260
 to believe you are very honest when 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.490
 They know I will not believe that lens 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.230
 ok we 're not totally going to get there 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.680
 concentration of santa and that is the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.830
 moment where the pod calmed down calmed down 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.130
 I already knew that I could not spend more 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.160
 time because it was an essential moment and 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.550
 special was a life that I had to 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.950
 pass because he did not want to die we're going to 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.560
 believe him because I think they are honest 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:17.579
 that this is the moment boys 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 Breathe deep because you can mario 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.970
