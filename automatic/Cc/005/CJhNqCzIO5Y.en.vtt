00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
surveillance system I notice that it's

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.810 
surveillance system I notice that it's
fixed<00:02:16.330> into<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.690> walls<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:18.070> one<00:02:18.310> all<00:02:18.520> you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
fixed into the walls this one all you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.880 
fixed into the walls this one all you
need<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.420> plug<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.800> you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
need is just to plug it in and so you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.590 
need is just to plug it in and so you
can<00:02:21.010> actually<00:02:21.130> move<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.790> freely<00:02:22.090> anywhere

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
can actually move it freely anywhere

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.540 
can actually move it freely anywhere
inside<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.140> store<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.710> set<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> up<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.430> if

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
inside of your store and set it up so if

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.730 
inside of your store and set it up so if
it's<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> back<00:02:25.090> room<00:02:25.330> or<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.110> front<00:02:26.410> I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
it's in the back room or in the front I

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.090 
it's in the back room or in the front I
want<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.340> specifically<00:02:27.940> aim<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.390> somewhere<00:02:29.100> so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
want to specifically aim it somewhere so

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.980 
want to specifically aim it somewhere so
it's<00:02:30.250> easy<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.700> move<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.030> around<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.810> indeed

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
it's easy to move it around it is indeed

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.050 
it's easy to move it around it is indeed
and<00:02:32.590> then<00:02:32.710> also<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.520> set<00:02:33.730> up<00:02:33.850> email

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and then also you can set up email

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.800 
and then also you can set up email
alerts<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.810> notifications<00:02:36.390> motion<00:02:37.390> sensors

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
alerts and notifications motion sensors

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.170 
alerts and notifications motion sensors
so<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.470> way<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:39.070> anything<00:02:39.550> crosses<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.120> path

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
so that way if anything crosses the path

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180 
so that way if anything crosses the path
of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> live<00:02:41.050> feed<00:02:41.380> you'll<00:02:41.890> be<00:02:42.040> notified

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.530 
of the live feed you'll be notified
immediately<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:45.070> let's<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:45.370> ahead<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.580> set<00:02:46.450> up

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
