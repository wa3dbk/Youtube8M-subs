bit

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.810 

curr<00:01:16.300> like<00:01:16.480> that<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:21.100> fishtail<00:01:21.400> braid

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
curr like that so the fishtail braid

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.630 
curr like that so the fishtail braid
instead<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.390> three<00:01:23.140> sections<00:01:23.650> like<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.220> normal

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
instead of three sections like a normal

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.400 
instead of three sections like a normal
braid<00:01:24.850> we're<00:01:25.240> going<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.420> take<00:01:25.540> two<00:01:25.840> sections

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
braid we're going to take two sections

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.210 
braid we're going to take two sections
so<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:28.720> going<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.990> two<00:01:29.290> about<00:01:29.860> equal

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
so we're going to two about equal

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.380 
so we're going to two about equal
sections<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.500> then<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:33.280> have<00:01:33.550> section<00:01:33.910> a<00:01:34.090> and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
sections and then I have section a and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.430 
sections and then I have section a and
section<00:01:34.810> being<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.240> from<00:01:37.240> section<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.140> want

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
section being so from section a I want

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.220 
section being so from section a I want
to<00:01:38.500> take<00:01:38.740> from<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.430> back<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.890> section<00:01:42.430> I

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
to take from the back of that section I

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.600 
to take from the back of that section I
take<00:01:44.230> it<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.650> cross<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.610> over<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:48.370> cross<00:01:48.580> it
