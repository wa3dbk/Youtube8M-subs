actually<00:04:07.920> at<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.250> low<00:04:08.550> setting<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:10.410> just

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
actually at a low setting to just

to UM treat this area here and you're
gonna<00:04:16.440> see<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:17.700> actually<00:04:17.880> creates<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.600> pretty

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
gonna see it's actually creates a pretty

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.310 
gonna see it's actually creates a pretty
cool<00:04:19.080> pattern<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.410> ready<00:04:19.590> here<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:19.919> go

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
cool pattern you ready here we go

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.130 
cool pattern you ready here we go
and<00:04:21.100> use<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> fractional<00:04:21.970> co2<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.110> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
and use a fractional co2 this is a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.080 
and use a fractional co2 this is a
fractional<00:04:23.770> co2<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.370> can<00:04:24.550> use<00:04:24.670> it<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.910> very

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
fractional co2 so I can use it in a very

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.270 
fractional co2 so I can use it in a very
aggressive<00:04:25.210> setting<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.960> really<00:04:26.440> make<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.920> big

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
aggressive setting to really make a big
