 farmer and practice variable and 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.219
 when pressing can be flexible 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.269
 but are due to their 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.369
 very expensive 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.140
 the machines usually only pay off 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.750
 high utilization in the inter-company 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.609
 used by the italian manufacturer 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.650
 masca we are on an interesting 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.369
 offer for budget conscious customers 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.570
 pushed 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.099
 the monster 770 cut has been around from 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.230
 42,000 euros including value added tax 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.930
 Nevertheless, the press is waiting with one 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 extensive standard equipment on us 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.020
 have the red monster on the sample 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.850
 The lining is set by four curves 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.520
 track controlled between pure clean 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.559
 The second US coach led the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.320
 a good two feet wide pick up over the 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.719
 ground the standard rolls down 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.780
 holder with spring tines supports the 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.210
 good flow has the additional designation 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 stands for the rotor cutting unit with 15 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.789
 knives 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.850
 It allows a theoretical cut 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.950
 length of 70 mm are the knives 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.750
 secured hydraulically against foreign bodies 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.520
 and can be accessed via the operator terminal 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 off and restrict 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.680
 the group attitude allows the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.470
 Use with victories with 15 or without 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.409
 knives convinced us the high 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 sip assets 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.429
 Precondition are sharp blades 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.630
 otherwise the cam picks up sound 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.609
 clutch too early 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 blockages can be with the 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.929
 hydraulically lowerable snowing ground 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 eliminate quickly 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.229
 the press room consists of two rollers 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.390
 and five endless straps 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.299
 It allows bale diameter of 80 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.189
 centimeters to a meter 70 the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.770
 Rolls keep the feed supplied 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.590
 always in motion, shaping the straps and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.420
 compact the ball with dry silage 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.270
 hay and straw, the machine works 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.000
 Reliable we could of the beautiful firm 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.789
 baling one-sided feel balances 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.219
 the chamber looks good as a wish equipment 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.610
 mask offers a right-left indicator 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.280
 on 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.079
 There are problems with wet you go that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.860
 Grass can roll on the drive 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.810
 fix 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.959
 The ribbons start to slip up 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.030
 finally the bale stops 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.190
 at the diameter and solidified 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.410
 easily determine yourself at the terminal 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.150
 depending on the harvest, you can get the density 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.319
 for the inner and outer area 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.480
 set separately 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.239
 There is also the possibility for one 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.609
 soft core at ventilation hay the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.900
 when finished is tied with latz and 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.069
 over the wide-opening tailgate 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.319
 ejected 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.750
 It works quickly so you do not have to wait long 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.859
 must stay standing on the hill convinced 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.660
 us the monster with his 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.459
 stability is optional 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.859
 available wide tire is thanks 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.510
 beyond that was our test machine 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.840
 with a compressed air brake system 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 equipped behind the far-opening 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.620
 flaps can be found the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.139
 main points of evaluation all chains 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.849
 are automatically supplied with oil the 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.859
 Lubrication of the press chamber and the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.349
 Pick-ups are central distributors 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.209
 summarized should be the electronic 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.349
 one can fail terminal once 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.940
 Nevertheless, with an emergency program 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.760
 work on 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.060
 Very good at the end of the season were 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.040
 our test drivers agree the monster 770 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.900
 card of masca is a modern one 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.820
 Round baler with extensive 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.500
 standard equipment and an attractive 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.290
 price-performance ratio 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.210
 Who predominantly hay straw and dry 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 senat would like to speak

 our fully equipped 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.510
 test machine impresses with one
