00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
really fast that you know sacrifice a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
really fast that you know sacrifice a
little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> their<00:01:05.040> throwing<00:01:05.339> accuracy

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
little bit of their throwing accuracy

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.520 
little bit of their throwing accuracy
and<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> end<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> year<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.110> mean<00:01:07.380> it's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and at the end of the year I mean it's

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.990 
and at the end of the year I mean it's
almost<00:01:07.770> essential<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> guy<00:01:08.970> like

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
almost essential that you use a guy like

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
almost essential that you use a guy like
that<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.780> actually<00:01:09.990> will<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that because they actually will have the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.010 
that because they actually will have the
stats<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.939> drew<00:01:12.119> brees<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> Peyton

stats of a drew brees of a Peyton

stats of a drew brees of a Peyton
Manning<00:01:13.320> 11<00:01:13.619> Aaron<00:01:13.830> Rodgers<00:01:14.130> they'll<00:01:14.700> have

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
Manning 11 Aaron Rodgers they'll have

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.100 
Manning 11 Aaron Rodgers they'll have
you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.840> good<00:01:15.960> actually

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
you know really really good actually

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
you know really really good actually
really<00:01:16.590> good<00:01:16.680> throw<00:01:16.890> power<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
really good throw power and then you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.310 
really good throw power and then you can
find<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.869> good<00:01:19.049> speed

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
find that with the really good speed

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
find that with the really good speed
that<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.680> why<00:01:20.340> wouldn't<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> use<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that they have why wouldn't you use a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730

beginning a month a fast quarterback is
even<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.689> dangerous<00:02:06.960> because<00:02:07.350> no<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.829> else

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
of huge disadvantage so I think maybe I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.500 
of huge disadvantage so I think maybe I
know<00:02:25.219> it's<00:02:25.430> not<00:02:25.579> going<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.819> go<00:02:25.939> away<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.239> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
know it's not going to go away but the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.240 
know it's not going to go away but the
the<00:02:26.870> addition<00:02:27.049> of<00:02:27.290> read-option<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.920> addition

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
the addition of read-option the addition

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.520 
the addition of read-option the addition
of<00:02:28.310> QB<00:02:28.670> rap<00:02:28.879> has<00:02:29.420> really<00:02:29.959> made<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.200> challenging

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
of QB rap has really made it challenging

the<00:02:33.829> past<00:02:34.040> type<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.370> quarterbacks<00:02:34.760> because

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
the past type of quarterbacks because

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.759 
the past type of quarterbacks because
those<00:02:35.239> plays<00:02:35.450> are<00:02:35.599> so<00:02:35.720> deadly<00:02:35.959> those<00:02:36.590> plays

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
those plays are so deadly those plays

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.710 
those plays are so deadly those plays
are<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.040> good<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.370> use<00:02:37.609> that<00:02:38.269> it's<00:02:38.569> almost

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
are so good to use that it's almost

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.479 
are so good to use that it's almost
sensually<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.379> know<00:02:39.500> stupid<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.069> use<00:02:40.250> any

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
sensually you know stupid to use any

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.429 
sensually you know stupid to use any
other<00:02:40.639> quarterback<00:02:41.389> piece<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> fast<00:02:42.170> one

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
other quarterback piece of the fast one

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.959 
other quarterback piece of the fast one
so<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.920> would<00:02:43.340> definitely<00:02:43.370> like<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.760> see<00:02:43.939> a

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
so I would definitely like to see a

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.539 
so I would definitely like to see a
return<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:45.349> accurate<00:02:45.829> quarterback<00:02:46.040> and

return of the accurate quarterback and

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.670 
return of the accurate quarterback and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
see exactly how they would do it but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.559 
see exactly how they would do it but

is<00:02:52.819> going<00:02:52.939> to<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> good<00:02:53.299> card<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:53.870> not<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.109> lot

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
is going to be a good card but not a lot

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.409 
is going to be a good card but not a lot
of<00:02:54.379> people<00:02:54.470> will<00:02:54.620> probably<00:02:54.739> use<00:02:54.950> him<00:02:55.250> at<00:02:55.849> 87

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
of people will probably use him at 87

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.020 
of people will probably use him at 87
overall<00:02:56.750> moving<00:02:57.590> forward<00:02:57.980> though<00:02:58.189> coming<00:02:58.939> in

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
overall moving forward though coming in

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.789
