00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.990
 from 3 to just the minister here today 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.180
 on the way in the Spanish hinterland and 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.100
 though with the new e-class more accurate e63 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:42.400
 amg s model 4matic that means in detail 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.160
 585 hp 800 newton meters four-wheel drive and 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.530
 while 33 percent of 67 percent behind 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.180
 What the numbers do not betray driving fun 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.180
 pure, I take a piece with me now 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.030
 as alleged city would be to comfort 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.770
 mode 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:11.030
 Of course that does not mean moderate 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.190
 unsporting but for everyday use, the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.409
 means the eight-cylinder is quite 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.810
 audible but rather not disturbing you can 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.520
 so that also long stretch fall 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.960
 without a feeling that the one 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.070
 feeling somehow on the nerves goes 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.070
 although that is not doing anyway 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.440
 continue to have the sport mode and the sport 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.120
 plus mode 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.340
 the first was sporting this one will 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.570
 even the car speaks in a different way 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 and the landing gear turns 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.170
 corresponds to 1 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.399
 Everything is switched with the victory at 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.049
 automatic transmission but you can also 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.759
 manually at any time via the rocker switches 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.759
 intervention 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.119
 here just enjoying time off down 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.119
 and step on it 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.900
 and always watch out for that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.370
 Tempo limit is currently moving in spain 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.880
 not to be underestimated as we learned 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.020
 to have 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.020
 last days
