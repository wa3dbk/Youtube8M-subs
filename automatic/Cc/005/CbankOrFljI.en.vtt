here we are my dear Stan and I've

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.089 
here we are my dear Stan and I've
reinforced<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:08.030> so<00:00:09.030> let's<00:00:09.269> go<00:00:09.360> take<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.630> look

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
reinforced it so let's go take a look

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:17.450 
reinforced it so let's go take a look
what<00:00:11.099> I've<00:00:11.219> done<00:00:11.250> since<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.880> last<00:00:12.059> time<00:00:16.460> took

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
what I've done since the last time took

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.160 
what I've done since the last time took
this<00:00:17.670> two-by-four<00:00:18.680> here<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:24.050> fasten<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
this two-by-four here and fasten it to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.640 
this two-by-four here and fasten it to
the<00:00:25.320> tree<00:00:25.560> back<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> lag<00:00:26.490> bolt<00:00:27.650> what

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the tree back here with a lag bolt what

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220 
the tree back here with a lag bolt what
I<00:00:28.680> didn't<00:00:29.010> anticipate<00:00:29.539> was<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.840> tree

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
I didn't anticipate was that this tree

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
I didn't anticipate was that this tree
is<00:00:31.500> crooked<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> there's<00:00:34.649> another<00:00:34.920> brace

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
is crooked so there's another brace

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.020 
is crooked so there's another brace
right<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:36.950> going<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.540> ladder<00:00:39.540> back

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.690 

and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.329> also<00:00:45.510> braced<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.700> on

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
and then I also braced it up there on

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.889 
and then I also braced it up there on
the<00:00:48.329> back<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:50.149> then<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> put<00:00:51.420> another<00:00:51.570> brace

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the back and then it put another brace

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.709 
the back and then it put another brace
the<00:00:52.170> very<00:00:52.379> top<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> rail<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the very top kind of like a rail so I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.189 
the very top kind of like a rail so I
don't<00:00:54.899> fall<00:00:55.170> off<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.870> trimmed

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
don't fall off and then I trimmed

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.670 
don't fall off and then I trimmed
trimmed<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> branches<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.850> there

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.410 

so<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:06.910> pretty<00:01:07.240> sturdy<00:01:07.720> it's<00:01:07.990> not<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
so it's pretty sturdy it's not that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.890 
so it's pretty sturdy it's not that
great<00:01:10.450> but<00:01:10.780> it's<00:01:11.170> it's<00:01:11.530> good<00:01:11.770> enough<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.280> where

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.940 
all right here's the target looks like
we<00:05:31.330> got<00:05:31.390> pretty<00:05:31.870> close<00:05:32.110> I<00:05:32.500> think<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.830> will

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
we got pretty close I think that will

00:05:32.950 --> 00:06:00.910 
we got pretty close I think that will
kill<00:05:33.670> a<00:05:33.730> deer

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:35.650 

little<00:06:01.880> high

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.230

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.320 

but

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
but

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.800

do<00:06:42.539> the<00:06:42.659> job

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.350 

these<00:06:48.650> things<00:06:48.889> are<00:06:49.070> in<00:06:49.160> the<00:06:49.250> way

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
these things are in the way

00:06:51.360 --> 00:07:01.719 
these things are in the way
ok

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.510 

well<00:07:02.499> there's<00:07:03.499> a<00:07:03.589> target<00:07:03.800> the<00:07:04.039> second<00:07:04.400> time

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
well there's a target the second time

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.290
