00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 illustrated with photos of the beauties 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.250
 artistic and natural aspects of this 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.970
 beautiful region 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.219
 Sicilian cuisine in the library there 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.429
 we are hiding in the suburbs of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 city there is a small dining area here 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.390
 absolutely detests that it's all 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.699
 white is eleven and a quarter e 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.180
 we are still at the stage two leaders will be here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.650
 in half an hour you will be pleasantly surprised 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.760
 true you will never believe what it is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.149
 success now the magnificent baby does the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.460
 home lifting ss teeth beautiful and by al 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.739
 Saturday at 8pm on a landscape 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 made of colors and space lights of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 vibrations that merge into a bond 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 between traditions and solutions 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 innovative architectural dream houses 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.489
 South America 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.489
 tonight at 22 on leonardo 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.210
 with the artist he connects lello cozzolino to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.729
 corigliano calabro to tell you 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 this transformation intervention of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.009
 a portion of a two-family villa already 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.109
 existing we noticed in drawings 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.359
 several steps that the touch of the 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.209
 client not of the client who of 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.700
 men usually try to escape is 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.560
 predominant state 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.599
 after the preparation area in the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.450
 facing the dining area the sure touch 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.560
 it also registers itself 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.319
 then the lady's intervention 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.860
 the use of a white card here too 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.239
 with this embossed damask effect 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.099
 so it looks like the paper you perceive 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.239
 maybe with the lighting on 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.060
 otherwise always a very white 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:13.440
 delicate that comes off very well with the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 console dl red which matched 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.930
 to the Murano chandelier also here a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.970
 different characteristic element that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.069
 maybe you have a rupture of contrast with 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.959
 what the minimalism of the house is 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.560
 however the fingers of the house in the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.170
 call up the red console and for 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.030
 deliberately disconnect from this 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.970
 ambiance and therefore also the red that yes 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.090
 it imposes itself in how now so that though 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.049
 draws the soul and taste of the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.359
 property 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.150
 an important thing of which not before 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.489
 we mentioned why if a stroke 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.950
 which often returns to the lello project 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.989
 the false ceiling 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 particular attention was given to 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.669
 study of suspended ceilings which 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.530
 characterize the space and have us 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.069
 allowed to distribute light points 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.319
 in fact there are different types of light points 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.060
 the diffused one is the direct one in base 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.680
 to the lighting needs of the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.329
 space that uses it 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.430
 countertop the design of 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.650
 false ceiling declare the species a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.150
 to prevail that by imitation that can 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.489
 be too perceived by the eye 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.459
 human and above all become the fifth 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.819
 which allows you to insert of 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.900
 share what diffused light 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.790
 compared to the possible light a through 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.939
 retracing our steps we return 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.159
 the entrance area there to earn it 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.799
 space of the nokia is the sleeping area then 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.230
 we climb on our scale that like there 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.579
 he remembered it was already pre-existing 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.129
 important for our friends too 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.319
 often some existing structures can 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.730
 he strongly affect us 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.409
 embellished line gratin in pretty tea 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.670
 coating them with this wood with the 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.220
 technician however we said one 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.180
 darker and darker shades as seen 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.579
 we get to the sleeping area anxiety to that 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.950
 but the sleeping area is full 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.650
 this filter area that anticipates 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.069
 bedrooms today that the first 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.019
 the striking element is this great the 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.659
 great overgrown that you got with 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.459
 removing parts of his sound we begin 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.289
 to tell it also in the materials and 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.120
 in those that were 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.509
 methodologies of realization of the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 same 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.280
 for our friends at home because the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.280
 parapet the choice of glass and which ones 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.990
 difficulties you had then in realizing it 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.690
 then the choice of glass for a reason 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.060
 very simple because the space I have 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.380
 could open and was recently small in 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.020
 as there are beams 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.610
 that I could not touch and therefore to give 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.979
 greater permeability therefore for 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.099
 make the space filter out 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.360
 better in the sense that we know if you look 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.669
 from insole to ward above we have 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.789
 preferred to use cristata the balustrade e 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.250
 layered tempered glass was 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.800
 made with a height of one meter e 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.009
 twenty 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.830
 we have designed some holes at the base that 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.789
 were made to fix it to the 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.729
 floor with steel pins that 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:12.229
 at first we wanted to leave it in sight 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.349
 while then we decided in any case of 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:18.650
 hide them to cover them to make it 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.560
 more homogeneous space and in keeping with style 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.770
 of the whole environment while for the 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.690
 parapet railing instead of 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.159
 evening protects from the scale he had 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.900
 change material then use 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.949
 steel another material very much in use 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.099
 in these years 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.199
 this is a ring made with 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.449
 cold tubular steel material that 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.310
 which contrasts with the with the heat of the 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.229
 wood therefore had to create this one 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.240
 bivalence between the warm material of the del 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.969
 parquet and the crystal cold e 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.270
 of the cia we told perimeter 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:53.259
 to the invaded of this furniture that 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.180
 custom designed in lacquered wood 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.889
 exact this case of the corner angle 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.580
 fis where the wing the lawyer every now and then 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.719
 he works when he is at home and therefore he is one 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.219
 area that can also be used 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.349
 guys there is still the daughter for 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:11.310
 study together with a small area 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.310
 relaxation living
