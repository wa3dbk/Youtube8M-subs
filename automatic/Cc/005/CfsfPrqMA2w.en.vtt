00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
really about the basics of fish keep you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160 
really about the basics of fish keep you
know<00:00:05.580> like<00:00:05.850> what<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.210> do<00:00:06.359> as<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> beginner<00:00:06.690> or

know like what to do as a beginner or
every<00:00:08.069> started<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.849> piles<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.929> up<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.290> all

every started and piles it up and all
your<00:00:10.500> fish<00:00:10.679> are<00:00:10.830> floating<00:00:11.130> around<00:00:11.219> dead<00:00:11.580> you

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
your fish are floating around dead you

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.190 
your fish are floating around dead you
know<00:00:11.790> I'm<00:00:12.000> you're<00:00:12.150> gonna<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.630> gonna<00:00:12.780> explain

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
know I'm you're gonna it's gonna explain

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.680 
know I'm you're gonna it's gonna explain
like<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:14.250> know<00:00:14.370> what<00:00:14.610> doing<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.540> do

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
like you know what doing what not to do

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.480 
like you know what doing what not to do
now<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> avoid<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.650> know<00:00:16.770> making<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.340> main

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
now to avoid you know making the main

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.779 
now to avoid you know making the main
mistakes<00:00:17.910> people<00:00:18.240> always<00:00:18.390> make<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> it's

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
mistakes people always make so it's

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640 
mistakes people always make so it's
actually<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.420> coming<00:00:21.720> pretty<00:00:21.900> impossible

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
actually it's coming pretty impossible

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.070 
actually it's coming pretty impossible
to<00:00:22.830> explain<00:00:23.070> everything<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.760> detail<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.930> what

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
to explain everything in detail so what

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
to explain everything in detail so what
I'm<00:00:25.170> gonna<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:25.769> gonna<00:00:25.849> put<00:00:26.849> little

I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put little

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put little
links<00:00:27.420> down<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> description<00:00:28.189> about<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
now I'm just gonna do talk about

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
now I'm just gonna do talk about
everything<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.489> briefly<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
everything really briefly I do kind of a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.150 
everything really briefly I do kind of a
overview<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> um<00:00:39.390> yeah<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.559> first<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:41.040> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
overview so um yeah so first thing you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
overview so um yeah so first thing you
want<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> tank<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
want to do is when you get a tank or you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.840 
want to do is when you get a tank or you
know<00:00:42.989> before<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> tank<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> research<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
know before I get a tank is research you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.590 
know before I get a tank is research you
know<00:00:45.140> just<00:00:46.250> research<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> tank<00:00:47.940> works<00:00:48.180> like

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
know just research how a tank works like

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260 
know just research how a tank works like
the<00:00:48.780> nitrogen<00:00:49.289> cycle<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.879> which<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the nitrogen cycle and which one up a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
the nitrogen cycle and which one up a
link<00:00:51.480> down<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:51.960> link<00:00:52.260> down<00:00:52.440> under<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
link down is what link down under the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.209 
link down is what link down under the
video<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.989> just<00:00:54.989> read<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
video and just read about how all the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.150 
video and just read about how all the
chemistry<00:00:56.640> works<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:58.590> ecosystem

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
chemistry works and how the ecosystem

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.420 
chemistry works and how the ecosystem
works<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.370> your

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
works all that so and when you get your

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.660 
works all that so and when you get your
tank<00:01:02.820> you're<00:01:03.090> gonna<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> cyclist

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
tank you're gonna have to cyclist

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210 
tank you're gonna have to cyclist
because<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:07.020> can't<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> tank<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
because you can't just get a tank and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
because you can't just get a tank and
put<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.490> fish<00:01:08.760> straight<00:01:09.030> away<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:09.689> else

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
put in fish straight away or there else

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
put in fish straight away or there else
to<00:01:10.020> probably<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.799> gonna<00:01:10.920> die<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> couple

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to probably just gonna die in a couple

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.510 
to probably just gonna die in a couple
of<00:01:11.670> weeks<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> pretty<00:01:13.439> much<00:01:13.619> when<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
of weeks so pretty much when you get a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
of weeks so pretty much when you get a
tank<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> comes<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> filter<00:01:15.600> usually<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
tank it comes with a filter usually a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
tank it comes with a filter usually a
light<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> user<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.100> well<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.479> your

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
light in the user as well but what your

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
light in the user as well but what your
filter<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:20.040> black<00:01:20.700> thing<00:01:20.880> right

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
filter does just my black thing right

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.240 
filter does just my black thing right
here<00:01:21.240> did<00:01:21.420> mines<00:01:21.600> an<00:01:21.720> internal<00:01:22.080> filter<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
here did mines an internal filter it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
here did mines an internal filter it
houses<00:01:23.520> their<00:01:23.939> these<00:01:24.180> sponges<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:24.930> will

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
houses their these sponges which will

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.510 
houses their these sponges which will
and<00:01:26.090> eventually<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.299> hold<00:01:27.540> bacteria<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
and eventually I'm hold bacteria and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.800 
and eventually I'm hold bacteria and
then<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.670> bacteria<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> grow<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
then this bacteria has to grow on the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.030 
then this bacteria has to grow on the
tank<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.320> pretty<00:01:31.530> much<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> bacteria

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
tank so pretty much about the bacteria

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
tank so pretty much about the bacteria
does<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> eats<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> fish<00:01:34.200> waste<00:01:34.439> which

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
does that I eats up the fish waste which

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.249 
does that I eats up the fish waste which
is<00:01:34.799> quite<00:01:35.070> toxic<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.299> fish<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
is quite toxic for the fish and I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
is quite toxic for the fish and I
converts<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.250> into<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.579> less<00:01:38.820> toxic<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
converts into it into a less toxic you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350 
converts into it into a less toxic you
kind<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> form<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
kind of form which you will take out a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960 
kind of form which you will take out a
water<00:01:42.600> changes<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.770> pretty<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
water changes so pretty much if you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.179 
water changes so pretty much if you
haven't<00:01:45.360> got<00:01:45.600> too<00:01:45.659> tight<00:01:45.869> tank<00:01:46.259> cycled<00:01:46.740> them

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
haven't got too tight tank cycled them

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.240 
haven't got too tight tank cycled them
the<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.759> bacteria<00:01:48.329> hasn't<00:01:48.600> grown<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
the but here bacteria hasn't grown and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.800 
the but here bacteria hasn't grown and
the<00:01:50.250> water<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:50.970> quickly<00:01:51.270> become<00:01:51.600> toxic

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the water will very quickly become toxic

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
the water will very quickly become toxic
and<00:01:52.140> your<00:01:52.229> fish<00:01:52.350> will<00:01:52.470> die<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.460> why<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and your fish will die so that's why I

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.420 
and your fish will die so that's why I
am<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> cycle<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.689> tank<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.430> usually

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
am if the cycle your tank and usually

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.569 
am if the cycle your tank and usually
that<00:01:56.610> takes<00:01:56.790> around<00:01:57.210> them<00:01:57.450> four<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.140> six<00:01:58.320> weeks

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
that takes around them four to six weeks

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.249 
that takes around them four to six weeks
so<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.659> spend<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
so in that time you can just spend that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
so in that time you can just spend that
time<00:02:01.469> studying<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> fish<00:02:02.759> you

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
time studying you know a fish you

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.429 
time studying you know a fish you
actually<00:02:03.240> want<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.479> guess<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> different

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
actually want to guess and the different

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.340 
actually want to guess and the different
types<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.509> cuz<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.079> mean<00:02:07.229> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
types and you know just cuz I mean you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.720 
types and you know just cuz I mean you
can<00:02:07.469> learn<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> lot<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.099> four<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> six<00:02:08.459> weeks<00:02:09.649> so

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
can learn a lot in four to six weeks so

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.520 
can learn a lot in four to six weeks so
yeah<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.230> when<00:02:13.230> you're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
yeah and when you're

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.930 
yeah and when you're
see<00:02:13.650> when<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.010> time<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:14.730> your

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
see when it's time to actually get your

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
see when it's time to actually get your
fish<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.470> want<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.770> maybe<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:17.069> better

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
fish and you want to maybe do better

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.390 
fish and you want to maybe do better

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
twenty girls at the size of the tank so

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.650 
twenty girls at the size of the tank so
which<00:03:38.190> isn't<00:03:38.400> true<00:03:38.640> at<00:03:38.790> all<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.209> I'm<00:03:39.329> gonna

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
which isn't true at all and I'm gonna

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.509 
which isn't true at all and I'm gonna
put<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:39.989> video<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.470> don't<00:03:40.920> down<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
put little video I don't down the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.190 
put little video I don't down the
description<00:03:41.730> explaining<00:03:42.540> how<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:43.049> that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
description explaining how all that

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.430 
description explaining how all that
works<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.420> want<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.630> have<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> look<00:03:45.959> and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
works so if you want to have a look and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.020 
works so if you want to have a look and
then<00:03:47.130> yeah

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
then yeah

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.199 
then yeah
so<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.630> next<00:03:48.840> thing<00:03:49.049> really<00:03:49.500> people<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:50.209> as

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
so the next thing really people them as

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.750 
so the next thing really people them as
well<00:03:51.540> yeah<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.989> filtration<00:03:52.470> itself<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.400> when

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
well yeah the filtration itself and when

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.680 
well yeah the filtration itself and when
you<00:03:53.850> get<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> new<00:03:54.239> tank<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:56.570> usually<00:03:57.570> the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
you get a new tank and usually the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.330 
you get a new tank and usually the
filtration<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.410> get<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.769> isn't<00:03:58.980> enough

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
filtration you get with it isn't enough

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.970 
filtration you get with it isn't enough
for<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.850> tank<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.600> let's<00:04:00.930> say<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.470> 20

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
for the tank so let's say you get a 20

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.979 
for the tank so let's say you get a 20
gallon<00:04:02.100> tank<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.060> one<00:04:03.299> usually

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
gallon tank like this one usually

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.319 
gallon tank like this one usually
they'll<00:04:04.470> give<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.190> filter<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.760> claims

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
they'll give you a filter that claims

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.660 
they'll give you a filter that claims
that<00:04:06.600> filter<00:04:07.109> up<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.350> 20<00:04:07.680> up<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:08.010> 20<00:04:08.280> gallons

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
that filter up to 20 up to 20 gallons

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.000 
that filter up to 20 up to 20 gallons
but<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.660> usually<00:04:10.109> won't<00:04:10.260> actually<00:04:10.470> double<00:04:10.980> that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
but I usually won't actually double that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.340 
but I usually won't actually double that
always<00:04:11.430> double<00:04:11.730> what<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:11.970> says<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.359> can<00:04:12.480> do<00:04:12.630> so

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
always double what it says it can do so

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.170 
always double what it says it can do so
if<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.590> says<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:13.890> can<00:04:13.980> do<00:04:14.070> 20<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:15.000> won't

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
if it says it can do 20 you won't

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390 
if it says it can do 20 you won't
actually<00:04:15.329> have<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.750> filter<00:04:16.470> with<00:04:16.650> those<00:04:16.769> 40<00:04:17.160> for

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
actually have a filter with those 40 for

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.000 
actually have a filter with those 40 for
a<00:04:17.430> 20<00:04:17.669> gallon<00:04:17.789> tank<00:04:18.169> kind<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.260> greedy<00:04:19.799> when<00:04:19.919> I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
a 20 gallon tank kind of greedy when I

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.420 
a 20 gallon tank kind of greedy when I
over<00:04:20.400> filter<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> tank<00:04:21.060> always<00:04:22.250> that's<00:04:23.250> one

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
over filter a tank always that's one

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.590 
over filter a tank always that's one
thing<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:23.729> should<00:04:23.880> always<00:04:23.940> look<00:04:24.210> out<00:04:24.330> for<00:04:24.419> and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
thing you should always look out for and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.290 
thing you should always look out for and
yeah<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.200> also<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:29.040> actual<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:29.790> in<00:04:30.030> the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
yeah and also the actual what in the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.810 
yeah and also the actual what in the
filter<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> media<00:04:31.110> there's<00:04:31.710> quite<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> lot<00:04:32.790> of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
filter the media there's quite a lot of

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.790 
filter the media there's quite a lot of
different<00:04:33.270> stuff<00:04:33.480> around<00:04:33.750> there's<00:04:34.620> that

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
different stuff around there's that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.250 
different stuff around there's that
carbon<00:04:35.340> which<00:04:35.970> always<00:04:36.450> comes<00:04:36.900> with<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.080> filter

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
carbon which always comes with a filter

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.750 
carbon which always comes with a filter
but<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.740> can<00:04:37.890> actually<00:04:38.010> just<00:04:38.280> throw<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.640> out

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
but you can actually just throw it out

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.750 
but you can actually just throw it out
and<00:04:38.970> replace<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.480> with<00:04:39.510> more<00:04:39.810> sponges<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.760> as

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
and replace it with more sponges and as

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.090 
and replace it with more sponges and as
well<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.480> did<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.810> video<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.170> that<00:04:43.350> but<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.830> put<00:04:43.980> in

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
well I did a video on that but I put in

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.160 
well I did a video on that but I put in
the<00:04:44.190> link<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.640> explains<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> explained<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.020> lot

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
the link it explains the explained a lot

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.070 
the link it explains the explained a lot
more<00:04:46.410> detail<00:04:46.800> about<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.700> filter<00:04:47.970> media<00:04:48.240> well

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
more detail about the filter media well

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.200 
more detail about the filter media well
that's<00:04:49.200> another<00:04:49.380> thing<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.740> wafer<00:04:50.220> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
that's another thing it's the wafer and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.330 
that's another thing it's the wafer and
also<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.930> tank<00:04:52.290> maintenance<00:04:52.830> for<00:04:53.310> example

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
also and tank maintenance for example

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.520 
also and tank maintenance for example
like<00:04:53.850> water<00:04:54.300> changes<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:54.900> how<00:04:55.110> often<00:04:55.320> you

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
like water changes and how often you

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.990 
like water changes and how often you
clean<00:04:55.620> your<00:04:55.800> filter<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.370> how<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.520> clean<00:04:56.850> it

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
clean your filter and how to clean it

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.080 
clean your filter and how to clean it
you<00:04:57.290> know<00:04:58.290> I'm<00:04:58.530> I'm<00:04:59.160> also<00:04:59.400> gonna<00:04:59.670> put<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.910> video

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
you know I'm I'm also gonna put a video

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.790 
you know I'm I'm also gonna put a video
in<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.450> object<00:05:00.750> description<00:05:01.200> that's<00:05:01.530> one<00:05:01.710> of

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
in the object description that's one of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.170 
in the object description that's one of
the<00:05:01.860> main<00:05:02.040> things<00:05:02.340> they<00:05:02.730> should<00:05:02.910> look<00:05:02.970> out<00:05:03.150> for

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
the main things they should look out for

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.330 
the main things they should look out for
when<00:05:03.450> you're<00:05:03.720> keeping<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.440> tank<00:05:04.680> how<00:05:05.190> it's

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
when you're keeping a tank how it's

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.680 
when you're keeping a tank how it's
actually<00:05:05.430> maintained<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.270> always<00:05:06.390> keep

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
actually maintained it and always keep

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.960 
actually maintained it and always keep
it<00:05:06.810> up<00:05:06.900> weekly<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:08.250> if<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.490> just<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> little

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
bit every week and you know it really

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.250 
bit every week and you know it really
does<00:05:11.970> help<00:05:12.210> if<00:05:12.480> you<00:05:12.570> leave<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.900> once<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.230> month

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260

does help if you leave it once a month
it's<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:14.070> your<00:05:14.220> tank<00:05:14.460> becomes<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.850> mess<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:17.130> and

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
it's a your tank becomes a mess so and

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.430 
it's a your tank becomes a mess so and
finally<00:05:18.360> also<00:05:19.110> yeah<00:05:19.950> plants<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:21.440> people

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
finally also yeah plants and people

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.930 
finally also yeah plants and people
always<00:05:22.590> have<00:05:22.770> trouble<00:05:22.920> keeping<00:05:23.220> plants<00:05:23.550> when

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
always have trouble keeping plants when

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.470 
always have trouble keeping plants when
they<00:05:24.060> first<00:05:24.300> get<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.480> tank<00:05:25.160> because<00:05:26.480> there's

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
they first get a tank because there's

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.810 
they first get a tank because there's
quite<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.140> few<00:05:28.230> Hardy<00:05:29.160> plants<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.700> will

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
quite a few Hardy plants that will

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.550 
quite a few Hardy plants that will
always<00:05:30.270> do<00:05:30.420> great<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.990> then<00:05:31.170> a<00:05:31.200> beginner

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
always do great and then a beginner

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.530 
always do great and then a beginner
tanks<00:05:32.520> cuz<00:05:32.700> they're<00:05:32.850> when<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.060> first<00:05:33.330> get<00:05:33.480> a

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
tanks cuz they're when you first get a

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.940 
tanks cuz they're when you first get a
tank<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.900> always<00:05:34.080> get<00:05:34.230> a<00:05:34.260> kind<00:05:34.440> of<00:05:34.500> standard

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
tank you always get a kind of standard

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.890 
tank you always get a kind of standard
light<00:05:35.130> around<00:05:36.090> 15<00:05:36.900> watts<00:05:37.140> or<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:38.870> quite<00:05:39.870> a

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
light around 15 watts or so and quite a

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.510 
light around 15 watts or so and quite a
lot<00:05:40.080> of<00:05:40.200> plants<00:05:40.680> will<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:40.950> die<00:05:41.100> under<00:05:41.430> that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
lot of plants will just die under that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.030 
lot of plants will just die under that
light<00:05:41.760> because<00:05:41.970> it's<00:05:42.150> not<00:05:42.240> strong<00:05:42.540> enough<00:05:43.040> but

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
light because it's not strong enough but

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.180 
light because it's not strong enough but
in<00:05:44.630> plants<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.720> usually<00:05:46.050> grow<00:05:46.260> or<00:05:46.500> quite<00:05:46.740> Hardy

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
in plants I usually grow or quite Hardy

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.360 
in plants I usually grow or quite Hardy
and<00:05:47.370> I'll<00:05:48.090> just<00:05:48.240> explain<00:05:48.480> what<00:05:48.720> they<00:05:48.810> are<00:05:48.840> now

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
and I'll just explain what they are now

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.970 
and I'll just explain what they are now
so<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.460> first<00:05:50.730> one<00:05:50.880> be<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.120> java<00:05:51.570> moss<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:52.680> M

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
so the first one be a java moss this M

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.520 
so the first one be a java moss this M
pretty<00:05:53.610> much<00:05:53.760> grows<00:05:54.000> anywhere<00:05:54.540> you<00:05:55.290> can<00:05:55.440> I

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
pretty much grows anywhere you can I

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.820 
pretty much grows anywhere you can I
just<00:05:55.710> tie<00:05:55.890> it<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.340> logs<00:05:56.790> or<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.720> stones<00:05:58.440> for

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
just tie it to a logs or the stones for

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.710 
just tie it to a logs or the stones for
example<00:05:59.280> or<00:05:59.430> anywhere<00:05:59.730> in<00:05:59.820> tank<00:06:00.120> just<00:06:00.330> Tyus

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
example or anywhere in tank just Tyus

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.530 
example or anywhere in tank just Tyus
and<00:06:00.900> eventually<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:01.770> root<00:06:01.980> itself<00:06:02.280> tie<00:06:03.270> it<00:06:03.330> with

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
and eventually a root itself tie it with

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.990 
and eventually a root itself tie it with
that<00:06:03.690> fishing<00:06:04.050> line<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:05.580> same<00:06:05.760> with<00:06:05.910> this

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
that fishing line and the same with this

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.110 
that fishing line and the same with this
plant<00:06:06.270> here<00:06:06.450> it's<00:06:06.660> called<00:06:06.900> an<00:06:07.140> abuse<00:06:07.730> it<00:06:08.730> grows

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
plant here it's called an abuse it grows

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.760 
plant here it's called an abuse it grows
pretty<00:06:09.150> slowly<00:06:09.840> but<00:06:10.230> it's<00:06:10.380> pretty<00:06:10.680> much

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
pretty slowly but it's pretty much

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.340 
pretty slowly but it's pretty much
impossible<00:06:10.950> to<00:06:11.550> kill<00:06:11.730> and<00:06:12.090> you<00:06:12.900> can<00:06:13.140> all<00:06:13.200> see

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
impossible to kill and you can all see

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.770 
impossible to kill and you can all see
the<00:06:13.380> roots<00:06:13.680> attached<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:14.790> wood<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.660> can

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
the roots attached to the wood you can

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.710 
the roots attached to the wood you can
also<00:06:15.960> just<00:06:16.140> tie<00:06:16.290> a<00:06:16.320> fishing<00:06:16.680> line<00:06:16.950> and<00:06:17.720> this

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
also just tie a fishing line and this

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.020 
also just tie a fishing line and this
stuff<00:06:18.960> here<00:06:18.990> is<00:06:19.290> called<00:06:19.680> an<00:06:19.920> ballast<00:06:20.550> this<00:06:20.880> is

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
stuff here is called an ballast this is

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.450 
stuff here is called an ballast this is
joint<00:06:21.360> felis<00:06:21.690> grows<00:06:21.930> quite<00:06:22.260> big<00:06:22.530> actually

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
joint felis grows quite big actually

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.790 
joint felis grows quite big actually
grows<00:06:23.970> at<00:06:24.120> taller<00:06:24.420> than<00:06:24.660> me<00:06:24.840> I<00:06:24.990> had<00:06:25.200> a<00:06:25.230> big<00:06:25.590> tank

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
grows at taller than me I had a big tank

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.130 
grows at taller than me I had a big tank
before<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.430> was<00:06:26.520> massive<00:06:26.910> but<00:06:27.840> he<00:06:27.930> gather

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
before and it was massive but he gather

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.900 
before and it was massive but he gather
other<00:06:28.500> types<00:06:28.890> that<00:06:29.070> are<00:06:29.280> much<00:06:29.460> smaller<00:06:29.730> and

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
other types that are much smaller and

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.790 
other types that are much smaller and
they're<00:06:30.150> quite<00:06:30.300> easy<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.600> grow<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:30.870> they

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
they're quite easy to grow and they

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.550 
they're quite easy to grow and they

plants here's a frog fish very easy to
grow<00:06:43.630> and<00:06:43.930> also<00:06:44.830> another<00:06:44.980> grace<00:06:45.310> I've<00:06:45.610> found

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
grow and also another grace I've found

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.270 
grow and also another grace I've found
is<00:06:46.030> that<00:06:46.060> java<00:06:46.450> fern<00:06:46.780> it's<00:06:47.560> also<00:06:47.740> similar<00:06:48.130> to

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
is that java fern it's also similar to

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.070 
is that java fern it's also similar to
this<00:06:48.490> plant<00:06:48.790> to<00:06:48.970> the<00:06:49.120> attaches<00:06:49.690> to<00:06:49.810> the<00:06:49.900> would

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
this plant to the attaches to the would

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.630 
this plant to the attaches to the would
either<00:06:50.920> eventually<00:06:51.670> roots<00:06:51.850> itself<00:06:52.150> and<00:06:53.640> I'll

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
either eventually roots itself and I'll

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.800 
either eventually roots itself and I'll
put<00:06:54.790> all<00:06:54.820> the<00:06:55.000> proper<00:06:55.270> names<00:06:55.480> while<00:06:55.720> I'm

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
put all the proper names while I'm

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.090 
put all the proper names while I'm
saying<00:06:56.080> them<00:06:56.200> as<00:06:56.290> well<00:06:56.410> on<00:06:56.500> the<00:06:56.590> screen<00:06:56.680> so

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
saying them as well on the screen so

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.920 
saying them as well on the screen so
it's<00:06:57.220> easier<00:06:57.580> I'll<00:06:58.480> put<00:06:58.660> them<00:06:58.750> in<00:06:58.870> the

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
it's easier I'll put them in the

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.010 
it's easier I'll put them in the
description<00:06:59.410> as<00:06:59.770> well<00:07:00.270> and<00:07:01.270> this<00:07:01.450> plant<00:07:01.750> here

is the sword plant usually I wouldn't
get<00:07:05.440> them<00:07:05.620> for<00:07:05.920> your<00:07:06.040> first<00:07:06.280> plant<00:07:06.580> bowl

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
get them for your first plant bowl

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.760 
get them for your first plant bowl
they're<00:07:07.240> not<00:07:07.510> too<00:07:07.780> hard<00:07:07.960> to<00:07:08.110> grow<00:07:08.290> under<00:07:08.590> low

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
they're not too hard to grow under low

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.360 
they're not too hard to grow under low
light<00:07:09.480> but<00:07:10.480> they<00:07:10.570> need<00:07:10.780> and<00:07:11.020> they<00:07:12.010> do<00:07:12.070> need

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
light but they need and they do need

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.660 
light but they need and they do need
kind<00:07:12.610> of<00:07:12.670> fertilizers<00:07:13.330> to<00:07:13.540> grow<00:07:13.690> properly<00:07:13.870> and

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
kind of fertilizers to grow properly and

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.100 
kind of fertilizers to grow properly and
for<00:07:15.670> this<00:07:15.790> tank<00:07:16.030> I<00:07:16.210> only<00:07:16.390> use<00:07:16.570> their<00:07:16.780> liquid

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
for this tank I only use their liquid

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.600 
for this tank I only use their liquid
fertilizers<00:07:17.740> and<00:07:20.040> because<00:07:21.040> they<00:07:21.190> take<00:07:21.430> these

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
fertilizers and because they take these

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.240 
fertilizers and because they take these
all<00:07:21.820> these<00:07:22.000> plants<00:07:22.270> here<00:07:22.480> take<00:07:22.750> the<00:07:23.740> nutrients

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
all these plants here take the nutrients

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.880 
all these plants here take the nutrients
directly<00:07:24.460> from<00:07:24.670> the<00:07:24.820> water<00:07:25.350> so<00:07:26.350> a<00:07:26.380> liquid

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.890 
directly from the water so a liquid

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.890 
directly from the water so a liquid
fertilizer<00:07:27.010> is<00:07:27.340> the<00:07:27.460> perfect<00:07:27.820> for<00:07:27.940> them<00:07:29.010> and

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
fertilizer is the perfect for them and

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.840 
fertilizer is the perfect for them and
yeah<00:07:31.900> I<00:07:31.930> think<00:07:32.080> that's<00:07:32.410> really<00:07:32.590> kind<00:07:32.860> of<00:07:33.010> gone

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
yeah I think that's really kind of gone

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.460 
yeah I think that's really kind of gone
to<00:07:33.880> the<00:07:34.120> basics<00:07:34.630> and<00:07:34.810> if<00:07:34.960> you<00:07:35.050> want<00:07:35.230> to<00:07:35.350> know
