00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480
 Mr. Hayashi knows that it is miracle water 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.119
 Mexican tiger fixing 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.349
 Lourdes Fountain in France 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.230
 The story of drinking weird water and drinking these waters spreads 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.949
 Many people in these local cities seeking water for this miracle 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.949
 Has been 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.849
 Does a miracle happen with just water 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.829
 When we examined the Mizuno ingredient, there is something common to these stores 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.670
 I understand 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.180
 The amount of hydrogen contained in the water was very high 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.650
 Play with the miracle water called Nakasen 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 We are qualified for tap water we usually drink 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.440
 Aquarium capacity of plate strain is 550ppp 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.890
 It is approximately 28 times of tap water 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 Furthermore the redox potential is also- 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 3I know that my consulting skills are strong 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.670
 What caused a miracle to people's bodies is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 It may not have been hydrogen adoption 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 Four professors and others reduced fishery fish proved by experiments 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.800
 Isn't it the answer driven by this miracle? 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.400
 The power of hydrogen 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.620
 I was able to take Switzerland to the end of my body 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.730
 The reducing power reduces the producers 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.190
 You may be able to restore it when you join 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.460
 It is medium hydrogen water which paid attention to this small power 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.680
 This is a fishery society of miracle water 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.230
 And this is a typical hydrogen water twist high capacity qualification 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 Damaged hydrogen water compared to intelligent stores 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.270
 300,000 costumes 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.470
 Murata This is a qualification of redox potential 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.390
 Oxidizing power is reduced to reducing power 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.969
 While being done 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.099
 The miracle water tank has not won first- 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.700
 It shows that the reducing power is stronger
