 specifically that you want and be the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 clothes and that the clothes did not see you and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.149
 now we go with the tips number one the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.289
 things become vintage after 25 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.289
 years or surprise 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.240
 vintage and has the material and the brand 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.149
 to see which ones really have value 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.800
 2 and learn chulisima and shuffle is worth the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.599
 take pity on after a few 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.720
 arrangements but always 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.660
 but the triple-double 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.849
 it's not worth it's usually the people 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.849
 who is selling do not know what he has 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.099
 4 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.450
 so you can see how big 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.880
 projecting yours they sent them the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.590
 haggling haggling kits to look at you or 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.300
 with my words to shout at the seller 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.250
 so that the pledge of the sand the price 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.080
 that you want and so in the end to be 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.630
 I like the other two and with this the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.459
 Basic basic question that I'm going to 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.959
 bring all that in regards to the arena 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.880
 will think tone 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.769
 another question what can you do I'm going to 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.870
 carry all this add the other thing I 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.640
 I know it sounds very depressing the matter 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 but in truth you win by winning two 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.300
 two come out winning then the problem 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.760
 that they are going to answer you, miss 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.890
 they say the Mexicans are the numbers 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.810
 one in bargaining and without carrying or that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.610
 you are looking already in your mind you already have 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.680
 to know what he wants what style he has 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.660
 that then already assured bad insurance 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 because if you go in a six purpose 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.930
 trailers and 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.360
 expert in that says it will be left without 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.739
 money and with things that you are going to put 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.840
 although you have found things 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.250
 beautiful chuli chasms you were not 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.860
 looking but good in itself is already another 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.750
 theme houses and do six do not leave 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.790
 carry for the color or for the price 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.410
 It's always in bad shape and apart 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.030
 It's not your size, do not buy them 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.000
 because you're throwing money and do not know 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.620
 try that and the 7 if you know how to sew or 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.420
 You know someone who does it for you if 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.920
 they do not want you to marry with it use to 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.110
 those who do not have to charge you dearly 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.819
 is international caigua covers and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.920
 I have to explain to you to choose the 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.900
 clothes please for the fabric we can 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.760
 medium alter the design and turn it into 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.920
 something new maybe not so average you can 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.750
 convert deleted and good you'll find 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.530
 material that you will never find in 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.230
 other sides 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.940
 8 we want the areas and you'll see a lot 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.920
 if someone where you can try the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.300
 clothes so teach them a trick 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.340

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.379

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.160
 close the nap 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.790
 therefore this means that the most 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.160
 It's likely that this belt will fit 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.110
 beautiful little belt has a 9 if you 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.330
 you had to buy some sunglasses, look 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.730
 very good in how much they weigh and sometimes in the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.680
 brand and if I recommend not spend much 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.420
 and has some lenses the safest thing is 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.340
 maybe they no longer have protection against 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.680
 ultraviolet rays and all 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.750
 downloads in the best option is not worth the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.210
 worth spending so much money in such a place 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.890
 finally we look at the tip number 10 no

 with these phrases that are typical of 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.560
 bazaar vendors who try to 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.710
 convince and they tell you so these sources 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.050

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.930
 obviously what is original is 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.480
 copied what you see but you have to have 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.370
 careful to see the texture of the material all 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.980
 in truth everything and although it is original 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.980
 this does not justify a price to overcome 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.200
 for something we are buying in a bazaar 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.360
