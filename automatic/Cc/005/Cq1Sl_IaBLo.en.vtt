I<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:23.080> high-tech<00:00:23.620> intelligent<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.610> fun

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
I it is a high-tech intelligent and fun

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.290 
I it is a high-tech intelligent and fun
programmable<00:00:25.930> gaming<00:00:26.350> robot<00:00:26.740> system<00:00:27.300> it

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
programmable gaming robot system it

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.440 
programmable gaming robot system it
actually<00:00:28.510> has<00:00:28.990> four<00:00:29.530> processors<00:00:30.250> 16<00:00:30.910> sensors

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
actually has four processors 16 sensors

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.680 
actually has four processors 16 sensors
and<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.980> of<00:00:33.039> them<00:00:33.280> are<00:00:33.340> touch<00:00:33.730> with<00:00:34.120> Apple<00:00:34.510> hug

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
and two of them are touch with Apple hug

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.890 
and two of them are touch with Apple hug
and<00:00:34.930> from<00:00:35.170> buffer<00:00:35.560> it<00:00:36.130> also<00:00:36.340> has<00:00:36.900> infrared

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
and from buffer it also has infrared

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.380 
and from buffer it also has infrared
which<00:00:38.290> it<00:00:38.470> uses<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:39.070> detect<00:00:39.430> other<00:00:39.610> robots<00:00:40.120> and

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
which it uses to detect other robots and

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.850 
which it uses to detect other robots and
its<00:00:40.540> base<00:00:40.720> station<00:00:41.140> which<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.380> that<00:00:41.649> little

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
its base station which is that little

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.490 
its base station which is that little
tower<00:00:42.100> right<00:00:42.310> there<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:43.600> well<00:00:43.840> as<00:00:43.989> rfid

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
tower right there as well as rfid

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
tower right there as well as rfid
sensors<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.700> it<00:00:46.480> basically<00:00:46.690> uses<00:00:47.050> that<00:00:47.410> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
sensors and it basically uses that to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.799 
sensors and it basically uses that to
interact<00:00:48.850> with<00:00:48.940> all<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.300> its<00:00:49.450> at<00:00:49.600> game

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
interact with all of its at game

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.810 
interact with all of its at game

the internet to be a necessity for it

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.449 
the internet to be a necessity for it
comes<00:01:07.479> with<00:01:07.719> and<00:01:08.709> then<00:01:08.859> you<00:01:08.979> can<00:01:09.130> even<00:01:09.189> access

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.179 
do jobs so with rahbaniya you can
actually<00:01:19.899> just<00:01:20.049> grab<00:01:20.289> it<00:01:20.319> before<00:01:20.529> you<00:01:20.709> can

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
actually just grab it before you can

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:42.270 
actually just grab it before you can
grow<00:01:21.310> new<00:01:21.429> tricks

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.700 

and<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:44.390> can<00:01:44.780> actually<00:01:44.930> go<00:01:45.380> over<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
and that can actually go over the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.219 
and that can actually go over the
programming<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.340> virtual<00:01:46.790> world<00:01:47.229> so

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
programming and virtual world so

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.380 
programming and virtual world so
basically<00:01:49.009> what<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.460> do<00:01:49.580> first<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:50.060> turn<00:01:50.270> it

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
basically what you do first is turn it

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.300 
basically what you do first is turn it
on<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.750> there's<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.110> USB<00:01:51.560> port<00:01:51.830> or<00:01:52.009> right<00:01:52.190> in

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
on and there's a USB port or right in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.899 
on and there's a USB port or right in
the<00:01:52.369> back<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:53.780> take<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.960> cord<00:01:54.759> plug<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.880> right

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
the back just take a cord plug it right

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.840 
the back just take a cord plug it right
in<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:58.610> our<00:02:00.190> computer<00:02:01.190> will<00:02:01.310> say<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.670> it

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
in and now our computer will say that it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.419 
in and now our computer will say that it
is<00:02:02.000> reading<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.450> robot<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.140> now<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.500> do<00:02:04.310> it

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
is reading the robot and now you do it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.279 
is reading the robot and now you do it
like<00:02:04.580> any<00:02:04.759> other<00:02:04.880> raw<00:02:05.270> product<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.080> put

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
like any other raw product that you put

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:07.779 
like any other raw product that you put
onto<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.649> internet<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.130> know<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.369> register

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
onto the internet you know you register

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.249 
onto the internet you know you register
it<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.030> kind<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.239> give<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.539> pet<00:02:08.720> name<00:02:08.899> is

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
it you kind of give it a pet name is

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.740 
it you kind of give it a pet name is
that<00:02:09.860> what<00:02:10.100> exactly<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:10.789> robot<00:02:11.239> spending

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that what exactly is your robot spending

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.110 
that what exactly is your robot spending
ma<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.980> actually<00:02:13.370> Freddie<00:02:13.580> clam<00:02:13.850> cakes

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
ma this is actually Freddie clam cakes

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.530 
ma this is actually Freddie clam cakes
so<00:02:14.870> clearly<00:02:15.650> he<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.010> from<00:02:16.310> Rhode<00:02:16.550> Island<00:02:16.940> thank

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
part is the online world first thing you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.040 
part is the online world first thing you
do<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.560> connect<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.660> now<00:03:57.660> what<00:03:57.900> makes

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
do is just connect and now what makes

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.810 
do is just connect and now what makes
this<00:03:58.200> really<00:03:58.440> really<00:03:58.800> different<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.790> fact

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
this really really different is the fact

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.730 
this really really different is the fact
that<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.300> do<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.600> use<00:04:00.810> your<00:04:01.080> keyboard<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.620> all

that you do not use your keyboard at all

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.710 
that you do not use your keyboard at all
you<00:04:02.220> actually<00:04:02.550> use<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.090> remote<00:04:03.360> controller

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you actually use the remote controller
