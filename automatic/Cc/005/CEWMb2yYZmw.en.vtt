don't think I don't know the time but

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't think I don't know the time but
kind<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.690> slipped<00:02:16.020> around<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.440> second<00:02:16.800> comb

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it's got to be tough i think now that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.970 
it's got to be tough i think now that
pro<00:03:18.090> days<00:03:18.299> over<00:03:18.510> waiting<00:03:18.840> for<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.110> draft<00:03:19.320> yeah

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
pro days over waiting for the draft yeah

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.640 
pro days over waiting for the draft yeah
it's<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.820> little<00:03:20.940> lengthy<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.630> mean<00:03:21.840> got

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
it's a little lengthy but I mean got

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.810 
it's a little lengthy but I mean got
visits<00:03:23.070> lined<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:25.519> continually<00:03:26.519> talking

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
visits lined up and continually talking

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.670 
visits lined up and continually talking
with<00:03:27.060> Scouts<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.540> meeting<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.930> coaches<00:03:28.410> and

with Scouts a meeting with coaches and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.620 
with Scouts a meeting with coaches and

so even though it's a month and it's
gonna<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> long<00:03:31.080> month<00:03:31.140> up<00:03:31.500> until<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.830> day
