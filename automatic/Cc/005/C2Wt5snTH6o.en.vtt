costs<00:02:13.720> time<00:02:14.720> uses<00:02:15.880> let's<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.030> put<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.209> to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
costs time uses let's just put that to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.880 
costs time uses let's just put that to
one<00:02:17.630> second<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
one second because that's like the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.540 
one second because that's like the
cooldown<00:02:19.459> time<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.500> starts<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:21.950> one<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
cooldown time so it starts at one and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.920 
cooldown time so it starts at one and
that<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:24.950> practically<00:02:25.489> instant<00:02:26.239> and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.520 

is<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:31.420> pretty<00:02:32.420> sure<00:02:32.690> blink<00:02:33.140> costs

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
is that it's pretty sure blink costs

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
is that it's pretty sure blink costs
energy<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:35.560> we're<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.830> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.610> test<00:02:38.330> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
energy but we're just going to test it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:48.340 
energy but we're just going to test it
out<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.660> guessed<00:02:38.989> uh<00:02:41.650> yeah<00:02:44.890> okay<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.840> pretty

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
out I guessed uh yeah okay so pretty

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.699 
out I guessed uh yeah okay so pretty
much<00:02:48.500> when<00:02:48.950> that's<00:02:49.280> done<00:02:49.549> you<00:02:49.850> go<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.090> your

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
much when that's done you go to your

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.190 
much when that's done you go to your
main<00:02:51.709> editor<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.670> click<00:02:53.120> marauder<00:02:53.540> wherever

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
main editor you click marauder wherever

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.449 
main editor you click marauder wherever
it<00:02:54.319> is<00:02:54.410> right<00:02:54.739> here<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:57.040> place<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.069> down

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it is right here and you place one down

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.240 
it is right here and you place one down
but<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.269> thing<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.750> haven't<00:03:00.200> found<00:03:00.590> out<00:03:00.890> how

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
but the thing is I haven't found out how

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.610 
but the thing is I haven't found out how
to<00:03:01.480> let<00:03:02.480> him<00:03:02.660> use<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:02.900> ability<00:03:03.170> without

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
to let him use that ability without

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.360 
to let him use that ability without
having<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.959> research<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:05.989> first<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
having to research it first so you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.270 
having to research it first so you
pretty<00:03:07.549> much<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.060> research<00:03:08.630> first<00:03:09.280> but

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
pretty much have to research first but

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.100 
pretty much have to research first but
you<00:03:10.519> know<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.730> could<00:03:11.030> practically<00:03:11.690> figure

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
you know you could practically figure

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.009 
you know you could practically figure
out<00:03:12.230> how<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.650> within<00:03:13.430> time<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.660> am

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
out how to do that within time but I am

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.020 
out how to do that within time but I am
lazy<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.620> just<00:03:15.859> research<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.340> anyways<00:03:16.820> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
lazy so I just research it anyways and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.240 
lazy so I just research it anyways and
it's<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.140> Twilight<00:03:18.680> Council<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.900> basically

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
it's in Twilight Council and basically

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.890 
it's in Twilight Council and basically
what<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.400> do<00:03:22.519> all<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:22.730> he<00:03:23.120> should<00:03:23.660> be<00:03:23.780> able

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
what you do all that he should be able

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.310 
what you do all that he should be able
to<00:03:24.109> blink<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:26.060> edit<00:03:26.269> this<00:03:26.600> video<00:03:26.840> so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
to blink and I will edit this video so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.920 
to blink and I will edit this video so
that<00:03:27.530> you'll<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.489> see<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:29.180> end<00:03:29.329> product<00:03:29.630> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
that you'll just see the end product of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.060 
that you'll just see the end product of
him<00:03:30.200> blinking<00:03:31.690> okay<00:03:32.690> guys<00:03:32.870> once<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:33.799> done

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
him blinking okay guys once it's done

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.090 
him blinking okay guys once it's done
researching<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.570> get<00:03:36.170> your<00:03:36.290> Marauders<00:03:36.769> or

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
researching you get your Marauders or

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.729 
researching you get your Marauders or
whatever<00:03:37.579> unit<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.150> gave<00:03:38.390> your<00:03:39.019> ability<00:03:39.560> to

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
whatever unit you gave your ability to

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.819 
whatever unit you gave your ability to
and<00:03:40.010> now<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.180> see<00:03:41.420> we<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:41.810> use<00:03:42.170> blink<00:03:42.530> and

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
and now you can see we can use blink and

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.000 
and now you can see we can use blink and
it<00:03:43.519> says<00:03:43.730> ability<00:03:44.329> can<00:03:44.660> only<00:03:44.959> be<00:03:45.200> used<00:03:45.410> at<00:03:45.650> once

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
it says ability can only be used at once

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.039 
it says ability can only be used at once
every<00:03:46.400> one<00:03:46.670> second<00:03:48.579> Josie<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.790> with<00:03:50.120> how

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
when you give something the ability to

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.559 
when you give something the ability to
blink<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:04.220> still<00:04:04.549> has<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.910> image<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.420> a

right when it blinks now i'm pretty sure
that's<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.780> model<00:04:10.140> /<00:04:11.010> art<00:04:11.460> problem<00:04:12.060> with<00:04:12.690> blink

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960
