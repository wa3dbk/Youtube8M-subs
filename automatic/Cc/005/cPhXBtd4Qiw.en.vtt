00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.609
 hello at all times first video as peace will be fixed to 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.559
 6 hours 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.389
 so I'll start by introducing you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.630
 no one so I am 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.449
 henry stone 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.859
 robert dutton seems a little more 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.929
 this basement 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.259
 so we can see that I have a lot of domains 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.259
 torches to recover a little without way 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.339
 class that the option to hurry 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.440
 for the race with a lot of titles 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.440
 the barriers 40 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 we believe it I'm very little decoration plants 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 fountain 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.280
 it's good 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.700
 and then singing with the agglo stop 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.680
 and then t 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 32 bits to other debates kirchner has sevi 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.660
 for paradoxes like that is what Jacques Chirac 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.170
 after 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.980
 a lot of different things as usual the subcontractor the practice this 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.990
 he's doing well and that's pretty weird 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.950
 but very strong 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.080
 in a link with the video 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.320
 returned fabric 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.820
 quarter of an hour 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.050
 we are having fun 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.320
 I think that any glazed 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 and add that he holds see above this meaning 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.250
 by this sector 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.500
 when suddenly good times for all 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 a good monster we rushed more inspired 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.950
 It must be said that I am hungry 6 plantations 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 a little if I could almost mythical 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 we're already going after 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.680
 so that's my room 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.250
 the few paintings 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.960
 later with kind words under the guise of light drop three 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.760
 children will be needed 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.939
 we see that we say 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.000
 bouhail since the update 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.320
 melilla people 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 abitibi baudier he touched the ground the touch more why 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.220
 so here you go 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.250
 if you sort of clauses epidemic rate planet 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.580
 that allows you from time to time in terms of welcoming the streets 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.580
 post it a little bit more light charvet 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.119
 hint that the pro-cnt were trying to step up which is yet a 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.359
 good movie 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.219
 so then tripartite agreement 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.419
 they all carry the painting 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.070
 der erde short pub storage room 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.340
 patrick black briefcase 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.769
 gray do not know anymore 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.959
 I think the state 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.829
 there it's like a kind of england Saturday 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.989
 light bouthillier 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.129
 so piracy 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.540
 it stems from bixente that touch more bearer arms limit for the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.069
 sofa this year again 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.120
 so there inconvenience with humor 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 imagine if I had invented everything 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.620
 prescribers saputo 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.079
 four concerts then 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.079
 they are shaped broke shelves 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.349
 small libraries 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 what surrounds so my TV and my buddy tel 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.949
 break health 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.519
 I have a lot of places still on the ground but 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.069
 I find this source 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.349
 so that's all his life was only a short time 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.349
 arrest q your customer space adds only to destroy 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.579
 treat it like that 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.139
 then captured 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.389
 a scooter title so that it may appear 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.689
 since prague 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.739
 a few weeks 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.809
 pity 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.769
 but you have to go out 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.309
 Why 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.759
 downstairs in addition to that the task is arduous 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.029
 mystery 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.999
 it's a knife in the hollow belly of the Lombard wave 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.259
 it's free 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.259
 French sports consume more than 35% 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.399
 as always the technical support of apple 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.219
 as attached 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 these cartridges not in opposite directions 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.800
 except that all doors 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.249
 this summer 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.019
 that's the deal also in the six or twelve floors 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.829
 we start with the first surprise 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.309
 record profits 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.489
 so that's what you thought 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.639
 what you found 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.789
 certainly for two years we live so it's 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.569
 kind of private cinema 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.879
 in the open ground 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.389
 So here is 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.870
 with them I am not one of those we love 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.470
 on me bravo 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.940
 tupac on me so I can not do as usual there is little 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.430
 sister of his most proud wife 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.270
 with the agglo stone that makes that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.270
 the rain that is clear that deepening for several days 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.610
 however, it must be flat 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.729
 dubois afp 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:35.759
 so basically it's long 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.139
 private hands 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.610
 because suddenly 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.960
 then 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.270
 go through there 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.810
 so here it is the second recruit of the fc merchant port on the other hand that here is the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.150
 kitchen with bar 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 and two stools 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.550
 the place to be able 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.779
 Article 4 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.969
 open the door with your mouth 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.930
 sort of plan work that the probable exit 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.629
 I used a lot of way and religion 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.120
 an even better fridge 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.990
 this team 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.030
 using the technique they throw objects a little 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.999
 either I show up at the afp 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.819
 robbie keane's goal 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.550
 to register 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.039
 Rebekah of dedications yesterday debates of Roma I blame myself 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.480
 for clauses only to light an oven 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.909
 little trick I think it's bp fire inside 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.139
 then bing he must interrupt his death 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.779
 his life since 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.800
 because this touches three games does not open challenge 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.870
 end of 2008 which gives outward 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.169
 and made king 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.319
 its net banking income 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.319
 then AIDS is simple so I'm pretty proud to say 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.279
 for now what she makes believe 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.580
 and see the entrance the exit with a magnificent I find it is 

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:48.879
 beautiful personally 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.740
 the office glazed to them half empty and half wooded so like that 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.990
 so he did glazed with 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.849
 five stays 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.229
 around the table and then at the foot of the table 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.499
 the umbrella to make water me I find that too I support it 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:06.150
 who 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
 small outdoor terrace 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.900
 it's almost forgotten 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.180
 besides a little design steurs by solid reasons 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 I'm always ready to take the cards 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.570
 If you want 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.660
 if we had a lot of cases at home near south defends 10th floor located 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.930
 in the attempt of the deposit 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.159
 it's a bit of a mess 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.749
 in general I respected 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:36.029
 he talks these strikes 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.689
 this is the head of this service 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:38.869
 must wait 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:42.579
 we'll see you very soon for a video of interpretation 

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:43.830
 my head 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.720
 in three sets and max anstie minced 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.100
 a +
