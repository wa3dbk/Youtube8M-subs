00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
this project I'm going to teach you how

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.070 
this project I'm going to teach you how
to<00:00:07.109> tie<00:00:07.770> dye<00:00:07.950> sneakers<00:00:08.519> sneakers<00:00:09.150> can't<00:00:09.870> be

to tie dye sneakers sneakers can't be

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.190 
to tie dye sneakers sneakers can't be
really<00:00:10.469> tie-dyed<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.910> perfect<00:00:12.809> sense<00:00:13.049> of

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
really tie-dyed in the perfect sense of

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
really tie-dyed in the perfect sense of
the<00:00:13.380> word<00:00:13.559> would<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.830> really<00:00:14.280> hard<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.670> scrunch

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the word would be really hard to scrunch

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.820 
the word would be really hard to scrunch
them<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.630> tie<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.410> they<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.680> be

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
them and to tie them but they can be

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
them and to tie them but they can be
painted<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.520> pretend<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.570> were

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
painted to pretend that they were

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.070 
painted to pretend that they were
tie-dyed<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.189> my<00:00:20.340> sneakers<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.119> took<00:00:21.900> out

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
also already soaked them in the dye

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.599 
also already soaked them in the dye
activator<00:00:27.210> solution<00:00:28.130> which<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> made<00:00:29.429> by

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
activator solution which is made by

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849 
activator solution which is made by
water<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.150> washing<00:00:30.390> soda<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.230> five<00:00:31.529> minutes

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
in green so we'll see how this will go
one<00:00:54.329> suggestion<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.079> we'll<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and this is what oh I'm going to do my

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
and this is what oh I'm going to do my
work<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.039> work<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.399> both<00:00:59.579> sneakers<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
work is to work on both sneakers at the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
work is to work on both sneakers at the
same<00:01:00.660> time<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.739> also<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.160> avoid

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
same time and that's also to avoid

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.840 
same time and that's also to avoid
having<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.840> sneaker<00:01:04.170> look<00:01:04.530> different<00:01:05.010> from

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
having one sneaker look different from

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
having one sneaker look different from
the<00:01:06.000> other<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> make<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the other so in that way if you make a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010 
the other so in that way if you make a
mistake<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.820> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.420> replicate<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
mistake you can kind of replicate a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
mistake you can kind of replicate a
mistake<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:11.040> sneaker<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.030> think

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
mistake in the other sneaker so I think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
mistake in the other sneaker so I think
that's<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.110> tip<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that's just a good tip I'm going to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
that's just a good tip I'm going to
start<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> brush<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
start with a brush and I'm going to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
start with a brush and I'm going to
start<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> yellow<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> way<00:01:17.759> I'm

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
start with the yellow so the way I'm

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
start with the yellow so the way I'm
going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> address<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> planned

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to address this the way I planned

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.429 
going to address this the way I planned
it<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.729> top<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.810> sneaker<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

edges a kind of data tie dye each look

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.490 
edges a kind of data tie dye each look
will<00:02:17.280> happen<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.730> by<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> dyeing<00:02:18.840> running

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
will happen just by the dyeing running

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.979 
will happen just by the dyeing running
in<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.100> sneakers<00:02:20.550> material<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.300> don't<00:02:21.540> really

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
in the sneakers material so don't really

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.410 
in the sneakers material so don't really
worried<00:02:22.800> about<00:02:22.920> having<00:02:23.370> rigid<00:02:23.970> lines<00:02:24.209> of

worried about having rigid lines of
course<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.200> always<00:02:25.440> work<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.070> with

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
course you can always work it out with

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.850 
course you can always work it out with
your<00:02:26.550> paintbrush<00:02:27.330> somehow<00:02:27.989> like<00:02:28.260> pulling<00:02:28.709> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
your paintbrush somehow like pulling the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.010 
your paintbrush somehow like pulling the
dye<00:02:29.040> towards<00:02:29.580> more<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> front<00:02:30.239> but<00:02:30.480> I'm<00:02:30.690> kind

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
dye towards more the front but I'm kind

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.560 
dye towards more the front but I'm kind
of<00:02:31.110> happy<00:02:31.500> how<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.700> yellow<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.120> looking<00:02:33.480> in

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
of happy how the yellow is looking in

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.050 
of happy how the yellow is looking in
the<00:02:33.660> front<00:02:33.930> right<00:02:34.110> now<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.070> I'm<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.790> move

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the front right now so I'm going to move

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.300 
the front right now so I'm going to move
to<00:02:36.600> my<00:02:37.470> pink<00:02:38.280> color<00:02:39.650> for<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.800> pink<00:02:41.040> color

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
to my pink color for the pink color

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.370 
to my pink color for the pink color
because<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.030> don't<00:02:42.209> know<00:02:42.360> really<00:02:42.840> well<00:02:43.140> how

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
because I don't know really well how

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.140 
because I don't know really well how
this<00:02:43.709> transition<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.370> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.730> end<00:02:44.880> so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
this transition is going to end so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.660 
this transition is going to end so
instead<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> starting<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.530> right<00:02:47.100> where<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
instead of starting it right where the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.490 
instead of starting it right where the
yellow<00:02:47.910> ends<00:02:48.480> I'm<00:02:48.600> going<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.050> start<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.470> little

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
yellow ends I'm going to start a little

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.890 
yellow ends I'm going to start a little
bit<00:02:49.890> backwards<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.910> give<00:02:51.120> space<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
bit backwards to like give space for the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.870 
bit backwards to like give space for the
dye<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.080> run

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180 

you<00:02:58.780> could<00:02:58.990> decide<00:02:59.350> while<00:02:59.650> dyeing<00:02:59.950> these

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
you could decide while dyeing these

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.890 
you could decide while dyeing these
sneakers<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.610> maybe<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.330> wouldn't<00:03:01.630> want

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
sneakers that maybe you wouldn't want

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.290 
sneakers that maybe you wouldn't want
the<00:03:02.110> top<00:03:02.320> died<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.490> that<00:03:03.670> would<00:03:03.850> be<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> cool

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
the top died and that would be a cool

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.360 
the top died and that would be a cool
look<00:03:04.510> too<00:03:04.780> if<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.260> wanted<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.740> go<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.160> that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
look too if you wanted to go for that

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.970 
look too if you wanted to go for that
would<00:03:06.700> be<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.910> good<00:03:07.090> idea<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.840> put<00:03:08.260> masking<00:03:08.770> tape

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
would be a good idea to put masking tape

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.650 
would be a good idea to put masking tape
on<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> areas<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.940> don't<00:03:10.090> want<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.450> die

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
on the areas that you don't want to die

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.610 
on the areas that you don't want to die
to<00:03:10.720> go<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.220> case<00:03:12.520> I'm<00:03:12.850> actually<00:03:13.530> want<00:03:14.530> to

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
to go in this case I'm actually want to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.650 
to go in this case I'm actually want to
dye<00:03:14.800> them<00:03:15.100> all<00:03:15.310> including<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.060> parts<00:03:16.480> where

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
dye them all including the parts where

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.750 
dye them all including the parts where
the<00:03:16.840> laces<00:03:17.200> will<00:03:17.380> go<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:17.920> I'm<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.400> worried

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
the laces will go so I'm not worried

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.050 
the laces will go so I'm not worried
with<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:22.980> okay<00:03:23.980> I'm<00:03:24.490> going<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.700> work<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
with that okay I'm going to work a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:44.220 
with that okay I'm going to work a
little<00:03:25.180> bit<00:03:25.330> on<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.690> second<00:03:26.110> shoe

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.580 

and<00:03:45.099> again<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.420> technique<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.290> really

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and again in this technique is really

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.089 
and again in this technique is really
important<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.190> test<00:03:48.489> other<00:03:48.790> colors<00:03:49.860> mix<00:03:50.860> with

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
important to test other colors mix with

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.740 
important to test other colors mix with
each<00:03:51.129> other<00:03:51.459> because<00:03:52.120> that's<00:03:52.390> what<00:03:52.629> you're

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
each other because that's what you're

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.720 
each other because that's what you're
trying<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.349> make<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.800> transition<00:03:54.310> areas

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
trying to make in the transition areas

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.800 
trying to make in the transition areas
so<00:03:55.060> always<00:03:55.930> test<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.650> colors<00:03:57.480> especially<00:03:58.480> if

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
so always test the colors especially if

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.699 
so always test the colors especially if
you<00:03:59.250> unsure<00:04:00.660> about<00:04:01.660> them<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.530> never

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
you unsure about them and you never

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.940 
you unsure about them and you never
worked<00:04:03.069> with<00:04:03.190> them<00:04:03.370> before<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:04.650> better<00:04:05.650> to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
worked with them before and better to

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.150 
worked with them before and better to
prevent<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.610> than<00:04:06.819> having<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.920> garment<00:04:08.920> not

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
prevent that than having a garment not

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.080 
prevent that than having a garment not
as<00:04:09.370> pretty<00:04:09.640> because<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:12.040> didn't<00:04:12.430> like<00:04:13.060> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
as pretty because you didn't like the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:29.860 
as pretty because you didn't like the
colors<00:04:13.629> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.930> end

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960 

I'm<00:04:30.350> done<00:04:30.650> with<00:04:30.830> pretty<00:04:31.190> much<00:04:31.430> all<00:04:31.669> of<00:04:31.730> the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
I'm done with pretty much all of the

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.210 
I'm done with pretty much all of the
colors<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.660> did<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.020> yellow<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.590> pink<00:04:33.860> the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
colors I did a yellow the pink the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.390 
colors I did a yellow the pink the
purple<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:35.240> blue<00:04:35.449> I<00:04:35.750> went<00:04:36.560> back<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> little<00:04:37.130> bit

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
purple the blue I went back a little bit

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.550 
purple the blue I went back a little bit
to<00:04:37.730> work<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.120> transition<00:04:38.660> area<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.320> just

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
to work the transition area and I just

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.760 
to work the transition area and I just
did<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:39.919> by<00:04:40.250> going<00:04:40.669> with<00:04:41.000> our<00:04:41.150> most<00:04:41.770> dry

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
did that by going with our most dry

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.760 
did that by going with our most dry
brush<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.880> just<00:04:44.000> kind<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.389> like<00:04:44.630> pushing<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
brush and just kind of like pushing the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.680 
brush and just kind of like pushing the
dye<00:04:45.919> into<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.250> areas<00:04:46.669> that<00:04:46.699> I<00:04:46.850> wanted<00:04:47.300> I'm

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
dye into the areas that I wanted I'm

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.629 
dye into the areas that I wanted I'm
ready<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:48.199> my<00:04:48.380> final<00:04:48.560> color<00:04:48.949> which<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:49.430> green

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
ready for my final color which is green

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.800 
ready for my final color which is green
and<00:04:49.699> that<00:04:50.000> will<00:04:50.630> go<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.380> yellow<00:04:51.590> part<00:04:51.889> and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
and that will go in the yellow part and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.860 
and that will go in the yellow part and
I'm<00:04:53.810> really<00:04:54.050> happy<00:04:54.440> with<00:04:54.970> how<00:04:55.970> these<00:04:56.210> looking

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
I'm really happy with how these looking

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.850 
I'm really happy with how these looking
so<00:04:57.199> far<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:58.900> as<00:04:59.900> you<00:05:00.080> can<00:05:00.260> see<00:05:00.440> was<00:05:00.590> pretty

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
so far and as you can see was pretty

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.340 
so far and as you can see was pretty
easy<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.550> again<00:05:04.880> I'm<00:05:05.180> working<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.780> transition

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
easy so again I'm working the transition

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:28.270 
easy so again I'm working the transition
area<00:05:06.560> by<00:05:06.950> just<00:05:07.190> pushing<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:08.120> dye

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.290 

okay<00:05:29.800> if<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.980> think<00:05:31.250> that<00:05:31.430> some<00:05:31.639> areas<00:05:31.880> are<00:05:32.240> a

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
okay if you think that some areas are a

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.240 
okay if you think that some areas are a
little<00:05:32.570> bit<00:05:32.810> lighter<00:05:33.110> than<00:05:33.470> you<00:05:33.560> want<00:05:33.800> it<00:05:33.920> to

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
little bit lighter than you want it to

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.580 
little bit lighter than you want it to
them<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.940> be<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.389> can<00:05:35.570> always<00:05:35.690> go<00:05:36.050> back<00:05:36.290> and

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
them to be you can always go back and

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.230 
them to be you can always go back and
just<00:05:36.710> apply<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.100> second<00:05:37.610> layer<00:05:37.850> of<00:05:38.830> dye<00:05:39.830> and

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
just apply a second layer of dye and

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.870 
just apply a second layer of dye and
again<00:05:41.240> I<00:05:41.270> just<00:05:41.419> wanted<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.930> remind<00:05:42.110> if<00:05:42.560> if<00:05:43.280> you

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
again I just wanted to remind if if you

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.970 
again I just wanted to remind if if you
wanted<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.360> make<00:05:44.570> a<00:05:44.810> different<00:05:45.320> pattern<00:05:45.500> or<00:05:45.860> if

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
wanted to make a different pattern or if

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.370 
wanted to make a different pattern or if
you<00:05:46.130> didn't<00:05:46.490> want<00:05:46.669> to<00:05:46.850> die<00:05:47.360> all<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.930> sneakers

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
you didn't want to die all the sneakers

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.050 
you didn't want to die all the sneakers
you<00:05:48.560> could<00:05:48.710> have<00:05:48.800> walked<00:05:49.100> certain<00:05:49.700> areas

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
you could have walked certain areas

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.400 
you could have walked certain areas
using<00:05:50.330> masking<00:05:50.840> tape

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
using masking tape

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:58.510 
using masking tape
I<00:05:53.020> wanted<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.260> dye<00:05:54.770> them<00:05:55.010> all<00:05:55.280> and<00:05:55.700> I<00:05:57.220> did<00:05:58.220> and

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
I wanted to dye them all and I did and

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.240 
I wanted to dye them all and I did and
this<00:05:58.970> is<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.330> final<00:05:59.690> result<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.410> this<00:06:00.980> was

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
this is the final result and this was

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.050 
this is the final result and this was
our<00:06:01.640> two<00:06:02.090> tie-dye<00:06:02.419> sneakers
