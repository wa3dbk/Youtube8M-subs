00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.680
 and installation of a pvc ceiling 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.860
 profile plas 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.380
 the best known vinyl polychloride 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.750
 as pvc is one of the most plastics 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.410
 used of the world tubes for 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:33.590
 Liquid conduction hoses doors 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.960
 and windows packaging cables toys e 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.750
 countless everyday objects are 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.380
 they make with this material because of their 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.680
 exceptional features 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.410
 the barbieri profiled plastering 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 It is manufactured with virgin pvc polymer and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.120
 special additives that grant 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 durability mechanical strength and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 excellent aesthetic appearance 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.240
 In this video we will see how to make a 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.080
 ceiling with tables profile plan of the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.080
 simplest way 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 first we will have to execute in the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.740
 Support structure that will be similar to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.319
 the one used to make skies 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.170
 Seams of gypsum boards taken together 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:37.319
 the level of the ceiling will give it a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.659
 35 mm solera placed in the 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.149
 shorter side of the environment and subject to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.170
 the wall using a screw placed 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.000
 on the top every 60 centimeters 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.640
 the lower level of the hearth should 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.490
 be 14 millimeters above the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.880
 Ceiling level finished 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.649
 the galvanized steel uprights of 34 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.470
 millimeters that form the structure 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.200
 secondary should be placed within the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 hearth separation therebetween 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 it will be between 50 and 70 centimeters 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.080
 depending it's about ceilings 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.480
 outside or inside these studs 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.930
 will be linked to other perpendiculars 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.170
 Master beams separated one meter 20 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.040
 centimeters and these will be hung from the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.080
 existing slab using rigid candles the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.480
 structure should be armed so that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.160
 stiles are parallel to the greater side 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.510
 of the environment and they are 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.360
 perfectly leveled 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.480
 the perimetral profile plas 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.180
 with the wing against the wall shimming 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.610
 between it and the hearth and linking it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.360
 with fixing screws number 6 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.790
 spaced 60 centimeters 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.220
 this operation is repeated in all 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.650
 sides of the environment at the angles or 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.680
 corners should be cut the perimeter in 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.170
 English for a neat ending 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.900
 once all the perimeters are placed 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.540
 flash profile and verified its leveling 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.849
 you start by placing the first table 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.390
 sliding it until it hits the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.390
 perimeter 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.620
 the length of the class profile tables 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.350
 must be greater than half a centimeter 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.450
 existing width between ends of the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.340
 wings of the perimeter to allow 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.340
 an easier glide 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.040
 a 1-needle needle screw is placed 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.420
 in the tab of the profile plus tab in 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.959
 correspondence with the wing of each 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.959
 upright 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.140
 the second table is placed in castrating 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.270
 the in the slot of the previous one and 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.420
 making butt 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.890
 in this way and the screws remain 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.440
 hidden 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.330
 it proceeds to screw the same 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.330
 way that with the previous table 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.810
 placement of the last table is measured on 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.360
 width of the space between the cover 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.960
 last table placed and the end of the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.449
 perimeter 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.120
 a table of a width is cut a 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.930
 centimeter larger and the measure determined 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.930
 previously 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.280
 is fastened to the table with his potatoes 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.220
 glazier placing it first inside the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.440
 perimeter and sliding the then up 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.250
 make butt in the last slot 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.250
 placed table 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.760
 recommendations the separation between 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.840
 Stands must be between 50 and 70 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.290
 centimeters 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.860
 perform splices between tables 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.590
 using the special piece union h 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:53.100
 for changes of direction of the ceiling 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.919
 use the flexible joint do not expose the 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.830
 product to the direct action of light 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.380
 solar 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.380
