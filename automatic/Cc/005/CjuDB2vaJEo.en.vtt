00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hey what's up guys so recently I

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey what's up guys so recently I
purchased<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.449> Corsair<00:00:03.899> SSD<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.589> f6d<00:00:05.130> GB<00:00:05.670> -

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
purchased the Corsair SSD the f6d GB -

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.140 
purchased the Corsair SSD the f6d GB -
and<00:00:06.710> before<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.740> bought<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.309> wanted<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> you

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and before I bought it I wanted the you

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.520 
and before I bought it I wanted the you
know<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.360> some<00:00:09.510> research<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.260> looked

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
know do some research on it and I looked

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.720 
know do some research on it and I looked
it<00:00:10.620> up<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:10.800> YouTube<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.219> there<00:00:11.370> really<00:00:11.490> wasn't

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
it up on YouTube and there really wasn't

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.720 
it up on YouTube and there really wasn't
that<00:00:11.880> much<00:00:12.000> information<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> I've<00:00:14.040> decided<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that much information so I've decided to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.269 
that much information so I've decided to
make<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> video<00:00:15.420> if<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.800> interested<00:00:17.190> in

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
make a video if you are interested in

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.900 
make a video if you are interested in
this<00:00:17.369> SSD<00:00:19.010> here<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> right<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.340> I've<00:00:20.460> pulled<00:00:20.699> up

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
this SSD here I right now I've pulled up

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.170 
this SSD here I right now I've pulled up
the<00:00:21.470> results<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> benchmark<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.820> ran

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
the results of a benchmark that I ran

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.800 
the results of a benchmark that I ran
its<00:00:24.990> Adi<00:00:25.529> i-64<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.730> disbursement<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.599> disk

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
its Adi i-64 the disbursement the disk

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.370 
its Adi i-64 the disbursement the disk
benchmark<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.830> can't<00:00:29.070> talk<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:30.570> what

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
benchmark that I can't talk and what

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
benchmark that I can't talk and what
what's<00:00:32.300> we're<00:00:33.300> currently<00:00:34.610> on<00:00:35.610> display<00:00:35.760> here

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
what's we're currently on display here

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.680 
what's we're currently on display here
is<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.510> bottom<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.739> standard

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
is the bottom right here is a standard

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.260 
is the bottom right here is a standard

7200 rpm hard drive and the top right
here<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.280> SSD<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:45.239> also<00:00:45.420> being<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> can

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
here is the SSD I'm also being you can

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
here is the SSD I'm also being you can
see<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> clearly<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.910> there's<00:00:48.059> no

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
see it clearly right there so there's no

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.229 
see it clearly right there so there's no
tricks<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.600> anything<00:00:48.829> um<00:00:49.829> things<00:00:50.670> should<00:00:50.820> look

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
tricks or anything um things should look

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.869 
tricks or anything um things should look
at<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.140> average<00:00:52.440> read<00:00:52.890> access<00:00:53.460> which

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
at here is the average read access which

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.479 
at here is the average read access which
on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> SSD<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> point<00:00:55.140> 17<00:00:55.800> milliseconds

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
on the SSD is point 17 milliseconds

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
on the SSD is point 17 milliseconds
right<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.570> which<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.289> look<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
right here which if you look on the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
right here which if you look on the
traditional<00:00:59.609> hard<00:00:59.760> drive<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.120> 14

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
traditional hard drive it's 14

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.840 
traditional hard drive it's 14
milliseconds<00:01:01.410> now<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.399> may<00:01:02.579> think

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
milliseconds now that you may think

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
milliseconds now that you may think
that's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> big<00:01:03.420> deal<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.080> huge

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that's not a big deal but that is huge

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's not a big deal but that is huge
especially<00:01:04.979> when<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.180> data<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> written

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
especially when all your data is written

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
especially when all your data is written
across<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.740> disk<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> all

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
across you know the disk and all

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240 
across you know the disk and all
different<00:01:08.790> sorts<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> sectors<00:01:09.799> it<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.070> is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
different sorts of sectors it just is

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.010 
different sorts of sectors it just is
just<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.570> much<00:01:12.659> quicker<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
just so much you know so much quicker to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
just so much you know so much quicker to
respond<00:01:13.380> um<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.700> long

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
respond um I'm good actually do long

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.550 
respond um I'm good actually do long
routes<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> computer<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.110> show<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> how

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
routes to the computer and show you how

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.010 
routes to the computer and show you how
quickly<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.880> operating<00:01:18.270> system<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.630> start<00:01:18.900> up

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
quickly an operating system can start up

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.429 
quickly an operating system can start up
on<00:01:19.140> SSD<00:01:20.150> now<00:01:21.150> another<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> note<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> on

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
on SSD now another thing to note is on

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.880 
on SSD now another thing to note is on
the<00:01:23.100> linear<00:01:23.400> read<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:25.049> very<00:01:25.259> end<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> drops

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the linear read on the very end it drops

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.210 
the linear read on the very end it drops
down<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.250> 80<00:01:26.430> megabytes<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.799> let's<00:01:28.799> say<00:01:28.979> if

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
down at 80 megabytes so let's say if

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
down at 80 megabytes so let's say if
you're<00:01:29.340> doing<00:01:29.400> me<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> transfer<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're doing me you want to transfer a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
you're doing me you want to transfer a
file<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.520> hard<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.049> one

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
file from a hard one from a you know one

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
file from a hard one from a you know one
drive<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.560> another<00:01:34.740> well<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.640> gonna<00:01:35.790> end<00:01:36.060> up

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
drive to another well it's gonna end up

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.850 
drive to another well it's gonna end up
being<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.600> 80<00:01:36.780> mil<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.140> guides<00:01:37.409> per<00:01:37.530> second

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
being an 80 mil my guides per second

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.080 
being an 80 mil my guides per second
which<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.189> isn't<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.460> fast<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
which really isn't that fast but if you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
which really isn't that fast but if you
look<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> linear<00:01:39.689> read<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.490> SSD<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
look at the linear read and for SSD is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590 
look at the linear read and for SSD is
266<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.100> gonna<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.119> lot

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
266 so you're gonna have you know a lot

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.069 
266 so you're gonna have you know a lot
more<00:01:45.780> speed<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.770> an<00:01:46.860> SSD<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
more speed if you go with an SSD and

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
more speed if you go with an SSD and
just<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.320> random<00:01:49.530> read<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.970> much<00:01:51.329> much<00:01:51.659> better

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
just the random read is much much better

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.639 
just the random read is much much better
on<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.399> random<00:01:53.850> read<00:01:54.000> -<00:01:54.899> 37

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
on the as you can see random read - 37

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.280 
on the as you can see random read - 37
megabytes<00:01:56.329> if<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.810> random<00:01:58.140> read

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
megabytes if you look here random read

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.340 
megabytes if you look here random read
is<00:01:58.500> 108<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> fact<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:01.170> no

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is 108 so just the fact that there's no

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
is 108 so just the fact that there's no
moving<00:02:01.649> parts<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
moving parts the you know that the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.749 
moving parts the you know that the
things<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.680> pulled<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.399> much

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
things can be pulled up much much

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.380 
things can be pulled up much much
quicker<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.240> SSD<00:02:07.849> I'm<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.209> actually

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
quicker on SSD I'm here I'm actually

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.040 
quicker on SSD I'm here I'm actually
gonna<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.849> I'm<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> reboot

and<00:02:13.290> show<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.500> guys<00:02:13.590> how<00:02:13.770> quick<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.970> system

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and show you guys how quick the system

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480 
and show you guys how quick the system
could<00:02:15.630> actually<00:02:15.660> start<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.370> an

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.380 
Windows 7 and HCI is enabled which you

should definitely enable if you have an

should definitely enable if you have an
SSD<00:02:24.660> because<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.710> allows<00:02:26.010> your<00:02:26.340> system<00:02:26.790> to

you know be able to erase all the

well here and I'll show you guys how
fast<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.090> thing<00:02:39.150> actually<00:02:39.750> by<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.290> also

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
fast this thing actually by the way also

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.050 
fast this thing actually by the way also
shuts<00:02:40.890> down<00:02:41.070> super<00:02:41.490> quick<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
shuts down super quick to you on a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.110 
shuts down super quick to you on a
system<00:02:42.480> not<00:02:42.990> come<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.230> focus

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
system not come on focus

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.060 
system not come on focus
that's<00:02:45.120> not<00:02:45.300> very<00:02:45.450> well<00:02:45.540> focusing<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.080> it

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
that's not very well focusing you it

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.980 
that's not very well focusing you it
shuts<00:02:47.400> down<00:02:47.460> much<00:02:47.790> quicker<00:02:48.030> than<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.360> would<00:02:48.480> on

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
shuts down much quicker than it would on

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.140 
shuts down much quicker than it would on
a<00:02:49.050> hard<00:02:49.590> drive<00:02:49.770> as<00:02:50.070> well<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:50.850> soon<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
a hard drive as well so as soon as that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.660 
a hard drive as well so as soon as that
light<00:02:51.330> turns<00:02:51.570> off<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.400> start<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
light turns off so you can start the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.110 
light turns off so you can start the
clock<00:02:56.880> pretty<00:02:57.330> much<00:02:57.420> right<00:02:57.630> now<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:59.030> here<00:03:00.030> we

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
clock pretty much right now and here we

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.620 
clock pretty much right now and here we
go

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
go

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
go
just<00:03:01.320> booting<00:03:01.710> up<00:03:01.800> into<00:03:02.190> Windows<00:03:02.550> 7

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.220 

and<00:03:15.650> basically<00:03:15.980> as<00:03:16.250> soon<00:03:16.489> as<00:03:16.670> windows<00:03:17.230> shows

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
and basically as soon as windows shows

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.199 
and basically as soon as windows shows
up<00:03:18.470> it's<00:03:19.040> ready<00:03:19.189> to<00:03:19.310> go<00:03:19.430> there's<00:03:19.790> really<00:03:19.970> no

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
up it's ready to go there's really no

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.429 
up it's ready to go there's really no
wait<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:23.390> basically<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.900> happens<00:03:24.260> and

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
wait so basically that happens and

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.140 
wait so basically that happens and
there's<00:03:24.590> there's<00:03:24.769> no<00:03:24.920> load<00:03:25.159> screen<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.970> it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
there's there's no load screen and it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.640 
there's there's no load screen and it
jumps<00:03:26.390> right<00:03:26.599> into<00:03:26.750> windows<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.560> guys

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
jumps right into windows and you guys

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.319 
jumps right into windows and you guys
can<00:03:27.829> see<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.189> just<00:03:28.519> clicked<00:03:28.849> on<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.060> Internet

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
can see I just clicked on the Internet

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.599 
can see I just clicked on the Internet
Explorer<00:03:29.629> right<00:03:30.019> away<00:03:30.340> everything<00:03:31.340> already

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
Explorer right away everything already

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:32.949 
Explorer right away everything already
popped<00:03:31.849> up<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.329> was<00:03:32.450> already<00:03:32.599> good<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.840> go

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
popped up and it was already good to go

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.220 
popped up and it was already good to go
there<00:03:33.290> was<00:03:33.409> no<00:03:33.709> wait<00:03:33.950> for<00:03:34.159> anything<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.989> that's

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
there was no wait for anything so that's

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.050 
there was no wait for anything so that's
just<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.470> little<00:03:36.709> demonstration<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
just a little demonstration on the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.020 
just a little demonstration on the
benefits<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.430> over<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> hard

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
benefits of this is the over a hard

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.990 
benefits of this is the over a hard
drive<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.659> standard<00:03:41.959> hard<00:03:42.140> drive<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:43.000> but

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
drive the standard hard drive is but

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.849 
drive the standard hard drive is but
yeah<00:03:44.209> keep<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.540> mind<00:03:44.689> my<00:03:44.930> hard<00:03:45.170> drive<00:03:45.379> was<00:03:45.680> not

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
yeah keep in mind my hard drive was not

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.759 
yeah keep in mind my hard drive was not
a<00:03:45.890> 5400<00:03:46.730> rpm<00:03:46.970> hard<00:03:47.090> drive<00:03:47.209> but<00:03:48.049> still<00:03:48.440> it's

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
a 5400 rpm hard drive but still it's

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.039 
a 5400 rpm hard drive but still it's
it's<00:03:49.190> still<00:03:49.519> not<00:03:49.849> any<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.510> mean<00:03:50.629> you<00:03:50.750> leaking

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
it's still not any I mean you leaking

see<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.470> do<00:04:21.560> with<00:04:21.680> 800<00:04:22.130> d<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.080> it's<00:04:24.080> right<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.680> my

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
see I do with 800 d and it's right in my

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.790 
see I do with 800 d and it's right in my
hot<00:04:25.550> swap<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.770> right<00:04:27.860> here<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.680> guys

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
hot swap this is it right here you guys

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.580 
hot swap this is it right here you guys
are<00:04:31.070> curious<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:31.780> yet<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.900> energy<00:04:33.260> makes<00:04:33.470> it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
are curious but yet the energy makes it

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.649 
are curious but yet the energy makes it
a<00:04:33.650> lot<00:04:33.770> easier<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.789> know<00:04:34.820> install<00:04:35.389> drives

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
a lot easier to you know install drives

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.430 
a lot easier to you know install drives
because<00:04:36.139> basically<00:04:36.349> you<00:04:36.710> just<00:04:36.919> slide<00:04:37.639> them<00:04:38.150> in

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
because basically you just slide them in

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.870 
because basically you just slide them in
which<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.560> mean<00:04:39.710> how<00:04:39.889> easy<00:04:39.919> is<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.340> anybody
