00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:14.380

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.969
 minutes of cream 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.100
 there was a little bit I put a drop of 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:28.619
 vanilla 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 and then I finish bringing it now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 we put the whipped cream in a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.979
 container and put it in the fridge e 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.649
 then start preparing the cake 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.850
 I put brown sugar as it is a 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:56.819
 I'm not going to pulverize this 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:02:01.649
 10/2 speed 10 or the pulverized 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:13.040
 I gather sugar on the bottom and put it 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:17.000
 the eggs leave the mixture for 5 minutes 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.000
 speed 4 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.450
 I add margarine made us a little 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.150
 choose the flour the starch I have 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.010
 already mixed together then I go to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:47.230
 pour the baking powder and cocoa 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.230
 milk and nutella 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:08.790
 I'm going to knead speed two minutes 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:14.940
 3 meanwhile we find in 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.160
 oven at 180 degrees so now let's put it 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.310
 in the mug and the pan di biscuits 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.720
 stars that we have to isolate but not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:30.300
 too revealed to pour the dough 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.870
 still thirty seconds speed 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.870
 2 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:49.220
 and now that the mixture is ready 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:49.220
 We butter a baking dish and I go to pour it 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.190
 let's arrange it a spatula 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.750
 let's face it in the oven for about 35 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.510
 minutes, however, we always do the test 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.640
 then cut the cake or put it from 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.860
 part I made it cool for good 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.579
 so I went ahead with my work 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.769
 I cut it horizontally and go to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.769
 spread the cream 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:40.789
 I put the other piece of cake on it 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:47.419
 even if it crumbles a little, it doesn't 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:50.060
 so nothing can be composed then 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.599
 now let's pass the cream all of the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.599
 bordeaux 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:12.470
 passed when the bordeaux clean a 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:17.560
 I certainly do n't like cell meals alone 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:23.740
 for logicians then mess a little too 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:40.330
 okay do not miss then we put ourselves 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:40.330
 the other cream now stopped 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.890
 kind not hear 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.419
 I make so many little roses 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:18.650
 scattered and finished doing all the 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:20.080
 little roses and now I put the biscuits 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.320
 pan of stars 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.320
 all around 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.610
 after more put all the pan biscuits 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:51.010
 of stars to the bordeaux I put it I know to 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.270
 center and this is the cake pan of stars 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.120
 my way 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.480
