in this video I provide insight on how I
like<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.570> photograph<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.500> edit<00:00:04.890> coins<00:00:05.839> to

like to photograph and edit coins to

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.280 
like to photograph and edit coins to
begin<00:00:07.230> one<00:00:07.830> needs<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.280> small<00:00:08.670> table<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.450> suggest

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
begin one needs a small table I suggest

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.530 
begin one needs a small table I suggest
a<00:00:10.410> sheet<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.889> plain<00:00:11.160> paper<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.940> provide<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
a sheet of plain paper to provide the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.930 
a sheet of plain paper to provide the
background<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> image<00:00:13.740> one<00:00:14.429> will<00:00:14.700> need

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
background for the image one will need

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240 
background for the image one will need
to<00:00:15.150> position<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> tripod<00:00:16.289> where<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> corner

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
to position the tripod where the corner

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.099 
to position the tripod where the corner
of<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> table<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:18.000> between<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.630> legs<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
of the table is between the legs of the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.370 
of the table is between the legs of the
tripod<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.980> shown<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.910> begin<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> tripod

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
tripod as shown I begin with a tripod

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.009 
tripod as shown I begin with a tripod
extended<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.430> way<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.449> 18<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
extended all the way and use my 18 to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.310 
extended all the way and use my 18 to
200<00:00:25.650> millimeter<00:00:26.189> zoom<00:00:26.310> lens<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.869> widest

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
200 millimeter zoom lens at the widest

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400 
200 millimeter zoom lens at the widest
aperture<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.179> essential<00:00:30.810> as<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> zoom

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
aperture this is essential as the zoom

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.500 
aperture this is essential as the zoom
provides<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.980> shallower<00:00:32.369> depth<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> field<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
provides a shallower depth of field a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.319 
provides a shallower depth of field a
ring<00:00:34.020> light<00:00:34.290> allows<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:35.250> even<00:00:35.430> illumination

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
ring light allows for even illumination

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
ring light allows for even illumination
of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> coin<00:00:36.950> here<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.520> looks<00:00:38.820> mounted

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
of the coin here is how it looks mounted

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
of the coin here is how it looks mounted
on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> camera<00:00:39.860> one<00:00:40.860> thing<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.370> note<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.850> where

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
on the camera one thing to note is where

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
on the camera one thing to note is where
the<00:00:42.239> groove<00:00:42.510> along<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.050> ball<00:00:43.230> head<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the groove along the ball head of the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.549 
the groove along the ball head of the
tripod<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> camera<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.170> set

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
tripod is so that the camera can be set

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
tripod is so that the camera can be set
vertically<00:00:47.219> down<00:00:47.460> perpendicular<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> the

move the neck of the camera down to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.979 
move the neck of the camera down to

one<00:01:20.760> needs<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.300> also<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:21.960> sure<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.350> coin<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
one needs to also make sure the coin is

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.710 
one needs to also make sure the coin is
centered<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.490> frame<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> lights

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
centered in the frame so that the lights

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.750 
centered in the frame so that the lights
from<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> ring<00:01:25.350> light<00:01:25.620> are<00:01:25.890> reflecting<00:01:26.430> away

from the coin and not where the coin is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
from the coin and not where the coin is
this<00:01:29.550> is<00:01:29.760> where<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.390> lens<00:01:30.660> extender<00:01:31.200> comes<00:01:31.560> into

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this is where a lens extender comes into

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.360 
this is where a lens extender comes into
play

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370

ends which attach to the lens and the
camera<00:01:41.480> this<00:01:42.480> is<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:43.020> looks<00:01:43.260> like

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
camera this is what it looks like

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.860 
camera this is what it looks like
mounted<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.310> camera<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> how<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.510> lens

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
mounted to the camera and how the lens

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.740 
mounted to the camera and how the lens
looks<00:01:46.170> extended<00:01:46.980> all<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.190> way<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:48.210> next<00:01:48.510> step

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
looks extended all the way the next step

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
looks extended all the way the next step
is<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.140> adjust<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.560> ring<00:01:49.740> light<00:01:49.980> to<00:01:50.220> make<00:01:50.400> sure

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
is to adjust the ring light to make sure
