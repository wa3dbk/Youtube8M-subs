00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
this will capture things that you can't

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.920 
this will capture things that you can't
see<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.369> as<00:01:10.490> an<00:01:10.670> example<00:01:10.790> if<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.360> did<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.690> screen

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
see so as an example if I did a screen

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.930 
see so as an example if I did a screen
capture<00:01:12.170> right<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:12.680> but<00:01:13.160> only<00:01:13.310> capture<00:01:13.790> what

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940

capture right now but only capture what
you<00:01:14.030> physically<00:01:14.450> see<00:01:14.600> right<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:14.960> on<00:01:15.080> the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
you physically see right now on the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.170 
you physically see right now on the
screen<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:15.890> wouldn't<00:01:16.369> capture<00:01:16.790> things<00:01:16.970> that

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
screen but wouldn't capture things that

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.330 
screen but wouldn't capture things that
are<00:01:17.270> way<00:01:17.509> way<00:01:17.750> way<00:01:17.990> down<00:01:18.229> here<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.310> that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
are way way way down here so that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.980 
are way way way down here so that
becomes<00:01:19.700> an<00:01:19.820> issue<00:01:19.910> so<00:01:20.420> with<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:20.780> little

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
becomes an issue so with this little

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.930 
becomes an issue so with this little

right here I can capture entire page and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.609 
right here I can capture entire page and
that's<00:01:26.090> what<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:26.360> going<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.630> do<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.470> I'm<00:01:27.530> going

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.749 
to click that once you do that you get
this<00:01:30.289> really<00:01:30.619> cool<00:01:30.649> interference<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.490> pops

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
this really cool interference that pops

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.210 
this really cool interference that pops
up<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.600> could<00:01:32.810> start<00:01:33.080> marking<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.649> up<00:01:33.920> so

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
up and I could start marking this up so

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.919 
up and I could start marking this up so
as<00:01:34.429> an<00:01:34.670> example<00:01:35.000> I'm<00:01:35.270> just<00:01:35.300> gonna<00:01:35.569> share<00:01:35.810> with

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
as an example I'm just gonna share with

as an example I'm just gonna share with
you<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.050> little<00:01:36.110> technique<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.130> could

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
you a little technique here I could

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.760 
you a little technique here I could
basically<00:01:38.030> say<00:01:38.509> for<00:01:38.720> demonstration<00:01:39.319> purposes

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
basically say for demonstration purposes

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.249 
basically say for demonstration purposes
I'm<00:01:40.250> gonna<00:01:40.429> click<00:01:40.640> right<00:01:40.670> here<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:42.140> that's

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
I'm gonna click right here and that's

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.410 
I'm gonna click right here and that's
gonna<00:01:42.440> load<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.830> into<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.429> markup<00:01:43.819> interface

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
gonna load that into a markup interface

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.660 
gonna load that into a markup interface
and<00:01:44.720> now<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.869> can<00:01:45.170> say<00:01:45.410> as<00:01:45.619> an<00:01:45.950> example<00:01:46.069> say<00:01:46.640> I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
and now I can say as an example say I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.980 
and now I can say as an example say I
was<00:01:46.819> doing<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.090> video<00:01:47.330> conference<00:01:47.899> or

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
or Chrome or most I think it's supported

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.800 
or Chrome or most I think it's supported
in<00:02:22.370> Safari<00:02:22.730> -<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.150> not<00:02:23.330> absolutely<00:02:23.720> sure

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
in Safari - and I'm not absolutely sure

in Safari - and I'm not absolutely sure
but<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.750> again<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
but I think it is so again this is the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.320 
but I think it is so again this is the
tool<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.010> use<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.430> save<00:02:28.640> myself<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:29.120> lot<00:02:29.150> of

multiple<00:03:31.040> devices<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:32.000> then<00:03:32.450> as<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.200> course

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
multiple devices but then as the course

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.140 
multiple devices but then as the course
builds<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.190> grow<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.520> course<00:03:34.820> it's

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
builds and as we grow the course it's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.360 
builds and as we grow the course it's
going<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.480> I'm<00:03:35.600> going<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.750> add<00:03:35.990> PHP<00:03:36.740> MySQL

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.250 
going on I'm going to add PHP MySQL
features<00:03:37.550> so<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.210> can<00:03:38.450> tie<00:03:38.780> everything

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
features so we can tie everything

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.070 
features so we can tie everything
dynamically<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.340> database<00:03:40.760> right<00:03:41.450> now<00:03:41.750> this

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080
