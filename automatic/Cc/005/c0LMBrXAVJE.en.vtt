your<00:00:37.350> fake<00:00:37.590> through<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.329> it's<00:00:39.329> enough<00:00:39.719> where

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
your fake through but it's enough where

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
strap that holds the chair down so you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.090 
strap that holds the chair down so you
can<00:00:45.570> move<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> chair<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> still<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.980> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.420 
can move the chair and still have it
strapped<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
strapped but you can make this just a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.630 
strapped but you can make this just a
plain<00:00:50.940> flat<00:00:51.809> deck<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.370> there's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
plain flat deck so that there's

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
plain flat deck so that there's
absolutely<00:00:54.059> nothing<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.739> using<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
absolutely nothing on it now I'm using a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.310 
absolutely nothing on it now I'm using a
mercury<00:00:56.940> 3.5<00:00:59.090> gasoline<00:01:00.090> engine<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
mercury 3.5 gasoline engine which is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
mercury 3.5 gasoline engine which is
actually<00:01:01.829> overkill<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.579> boat<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
actually overkill for this boat a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
actually overkill for this boat a
two-horse<00:01:03.239> would<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.600> done<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.780> fine

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
two-horse would have done just fine

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.440 
two-horse would have done just fine
2.5<00:01:06.320> plenty<00:01:07.320> plenty<00:01:07.520> 3.5<00:01:08.520> unnecessary<00:01:09.240> but

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
2.5 plenty plenty 3.5 unnecessary but

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.870 
2.5 plenty plenty 3.5 unnecessary but
the<00:01:09.540> best<00:01:09.810> thing<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.260> 3.5<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.640> barely

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the best thing about a 3.5 is you barely

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.340 
the best thing about a 3.5 is you barely
have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> crack<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> above<00:01:12.830> idle<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:15.259> you<00:01:16.259> know

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
have to crack it above idle to you know

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.679 
have to crack it above idle to you know
to<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.710> five<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.310> six<00:01:17.460> knots<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> they

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to get five or six knots out of it they

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.090 
to get five or six knots out of it they
really<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.619> than<00:01:19.770> 7

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
really don't want to go into more than 7
