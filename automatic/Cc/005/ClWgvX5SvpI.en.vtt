00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
onto something we have a specific design

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170 
onto something we have a specific design
language<00:02:13.290> which<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.980> only<00:02:14.190> American<00:02:14.730> can

again<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.750> runner<00:02:15.959> I'd<00:02:16.650> agenda<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.310> run<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
again the runner I'd agenda can run it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.160 
again the runner I'd agenda can run it
on<00:02:17.580> or<00:02:18.030> ethanol<00:02:18.660> or<00:02:19.380> gas<00:02:20.090> all<00:02:21.090> three<00:02:21.390> today

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
on or ethanol or gas all three today

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.930 
on or ethanol or gas all three today
it's<00:02:22.350> very<00:02:22.650> much<00:02:22.980> twat<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> customer<00:02:23.670> want

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
it's very much twat as a customer want

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.240 
it's very much twat as a customer want
not<00:02:24.900> what<00:02:25.080> does<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> factory<00:02:25.709> need<00:02:25.890> what's

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
not what does the factory need what's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.330 
not what does the factory need what's
the<00:02:26.430> customer<00:02:26.820> one<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.570> that's<00:02:27.840> big<00:02:28.560> change<00:02:28.830> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the customer one and that's big change I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.320 
the customer one and that's big change I
think<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.350> that's<00:02:31.350> my<00:02:31.620> contribution<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
think that that's my contribution to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.500 
think that that's my contribution to
make<00:02:33.510> forts<00:02:34.040> look<00:02:35.040> great

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
