Nature Boy website today we'd be using

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.430 
Nature Boy website today we'd be using
our<00:00:38.280> tocotrienols<00:00:38.729> very<00:00:39.390> high<00:00:39.780> form<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
our tocotrienols very high form of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.149 
our tocotrienols very high form of
vitamin<00:00:40.620> E<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:42.479> a<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> Anila<00:00:43.290> vanilla

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.159 
vitamin E it has a kind of Anila vanilla

vitamin E it has a kind of Anila vanilla
flavoring<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> matches

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
flavoring to it so it kind of matches

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.969 
flavoring to it so it kind of matches
good<00:00:46.650> with<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.339> orange<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:49.680> we're<00:00:49.860> going

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.969 
tocotrienols along with an orange and
that's<00:01:15.420> why<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.600> call<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.929> dreamsicle<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that's why we call it the dreamsicle so

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
that's why we call it the dreamsicle so
and<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.969> use<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> vanilla<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and we use the vanilla because the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.389 
vanilla and orange Conn it goes a little
better<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.679> through<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.799> magic<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
better here so through the magic of

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:32.680 
better here so through the magic of
video<00:01:23.789> I'm<00:01:24.329> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.780> cut<00:01:25.079> this<00:01:25.259> Warren<00:01:25.649> here

voila we have an orange you're probably

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
voila we have an orange you're probably
asking<00:01:37.170> why<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.800> just<00:01:37.980> use<00:01:38.190> orange

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
asking why don't we just use orange

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.990 
asking why don't we just use orange
juice<00:01:39.320> well<00:01:40.320> orange<00:01:41.010> is<00:01:41.100> usually<00:01:41.430> pasteurize

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
juice well orange is usually pasteurize

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300 
juice well orange is usually pasteurize
and<00:01:42.360> vitamin<00:01:42.750> C<00:01:42.930> contents<00:01:43.530> probably<00:01:44.130> lost

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and vitamin C contents probably lost

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.640 
and vitamin C contents probably lost
most<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.450> gets<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:48.650> see

and really helps with scan and repairing
for<00:02:00.840> body<00:02:00.990> repairs<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.010> everything<00:02:02.400> in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

for body repairs so I like everything in
its<00:02:02.820> natural<00:02:03.030> state<00:02:03.300> so<00:02:03.690> that's<00:02:03.870> why<00:02:04.080> we<00:02:04.110> use<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
its natural state so that's why we use a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.219 
its natural state so that's why we use a
fresh<00:02:04.770> orange<00:02:05.190> try<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.910> get<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.120> naval<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:07.080> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
fresh orange try to get a naval with the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.240 
fresh orange try to get a naval with the
white<00:02:07.440> because<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> white<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:08.190> very

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
white because the white is very

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.820

you if this blender will handle the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.870 
you if this blender will handle the
action<00:04:33.490> get<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:34.910> there<00:04:36.370> now<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.700> like

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.999 
dreamsicle I really recommend if you can
get<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> higher<00:05:05.360> speed<00:05:05.810> blender<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.530> does<00:05:06.740> work

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
get a higher speed blender it does work

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.029 
get a higher speed blender it does work
but<00:05:07.599> we'll<00:05:08.599> get<00:05:08.720> into<00:05:08.840> our<00:05:09.110> other<00:05:09.440> videos<00:05:09.830> with

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
but we'll get into our other videos with

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.680 
but we'll get into our other videos with
higher<00:05:10.190> speed<00:05:10.520> blender<00:05:10.639> but<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.240> can't<00:05:11.509> get

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
higher speed blender but you can't get

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.080 
higher speed blender but you can't get
away<00:05:11.780> with<00:05:12.020> that<00:05:12.169> but<00:05:12.470> down<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.220> road<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.940> can

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
away with that but down the road you can

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.779 
away with that but down the road you can
afford<00:05:14.389> it<00:05:14.569> get<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.740> Blendtec<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:16.220> Vitamix

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
afford it get the Blendtec or Vitamix

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.939 
afford it get the Blendtec or Vitamix
because<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.300> really<00:05:17.449> doesn't<00:05:18.379> job<00:05:18.740> much

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
because that really doesn't job much

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:55.490 
because that really doesn't job much
better<00:05:20.379> cheers<00:05:21.379> and<00:05:21.830> see<00:05:22.430> you

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.560
