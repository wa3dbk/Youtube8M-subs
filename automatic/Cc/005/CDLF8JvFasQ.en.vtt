from the very first ipod touch and see
what<00:00:40.990> we<00:00:41.110> can<00:00:41.260> do<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.620> predict<00:00:42.100> what's<00:00:42.790> going

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.319 
um yeah so we're gonna start out with
the<00:00:49.030> design<00:00:49.900> mainly<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:51.579> that's<00:00:51.880> a<00:00:52.060> huge

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
the design mainly because that's a huge

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.150 
the design mainly because that's a huge
thing<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.930> incorporates<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.590> screen<00:00:53.950> which

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
thing that incorporates the screen which

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.770 
thing that incorporates the screen which
is<00:00:54.310> what<00:00:54.430> we<00:00:54.520> want<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.730> start<00:00:54.910> out<00:00:55.090> by<00:00:55.720> talking

is what we want to start out by talking
about<00:00:56.200> so<00:00:56.920> right<00:00:57.070> now<00:00:57.100> we<00:00:57.220> have<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.489> 3.5<00:00:57.760> inch

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
about so right now we have the 3.5 inch

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.810 
androids and all them getting 4.3 inch
screens<00:01:04.960> i<00:01:05.170> think<00:01:05.409> that<00:01:05.649> apple<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.490> definitely

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
screens i think that apple is definitely

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.010 
screens i think that apple is definitely
going<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:06.970> need<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.149> make<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.509> bigger<00:01:07.720> screen

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
going to need to make a bigger screen

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.690 
going to need to make a bigger screen
but<00:01:08.500> what<00:01:08.740> do<00:01:08.800> you<00:01:08.860> think<00:01:09.070> about<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.430> i

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
but what do you think about that i

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.330 
but what do you think about that i
personally<00:01:10.690> think<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:11.159> they're<00:01:12.159> going<00:01:12.280> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
personally think that they're going to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.469 
personally think that they're going to
keep<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.700> same<00:01:12.729> because<00:01:13.180> they<00:01:13.330> have<00:01:13.450> a

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
keep it the same because they have a

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.610 
keep it the same because they have a
certain<00:01:14.400> market<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:15.790> it's<00:01:16.360> apple<00:01:17.320> has<00:01:17.409> always

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
certain market and it's apple has always

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.010 
certain market and it's apple has always
been<00:01:17.710> about<00:01:17.830> streamlining<00:01:18.250> their<00:01:18.880> devices<00:01:19.210> as

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
been about streamlining their devices as

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.930 
been about streamlining their devices as
you<00:01:20.200> can<00:01:20.320> see<00:01:20.440> with<00:01:20.530> how<00:01:20.950> their<00:01:21.190> macbooks<00:01:21.700> look

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
you can see with how their macbooks look

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.940 
you can see with how their macbooks look
all<00:01:22.690> their<00:01:22.840> devices<00:01:22.960> are<00:01:23.380> extremely

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
all their devices are extremely

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.250 
all their devices are extremely
streamlined<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.060> making<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:25.870> bigger<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.170> think

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
streamlined and making it bigger I think

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.890 
streamlined and making it bigger I think
would<00:01:26.500> make<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.799> little<00:01:26.950> bit<00:01:27.130> more<00:01:27.250> clumsy

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
would make it a little bit more clumsy

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.030 
would make it a little bit more clumsy
so<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:28.930> don't<00:01:29.380> think<00:01:29.530> they're<00:01:29.740> going<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.890> do

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
so I don't think they're going to do

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.700 
so I don't think they're going to do
that<00:01:30.190> one<00:01:31.030> reason<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.630> think<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.260> droids<00:01:32.620> are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
that one reason I think the droids are

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.469 
that one reason I think the droids are
enlarging<00:01:33.190> their<00:01:33.460> screens<00:01:33.880> are<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.270> increase

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
enlarging their screens are to increase

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.770 
enlarging their screens are to increase
the<00:01:35.580> space<00:01:36.580> for<00:01:36.850> they're<00:01:37.000> pretty<00:01:37.540> bad

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
the space for they're pretty bad

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.840 
the space for they're pretty bad
on-screen<00:01:38.290> keyboards<00:01:38.920> but<00:01:40.320> iOS<00:01:41.320> from<00:01:41.979> from

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
on-screen keyboards but iOS from from

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.580 
on-screen keyboards but iOS from from
Apple<00:01:43.210> has<00:01:43.390> pretty<00:01:43.840> much<00:01:44.020> perfected<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
Apple has pretty much perfected the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.780 
Apple has pretty much perfected the
on-screen<00:01:44.830> keyboard<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.430> they<00:01:45.490> don't<00:01:45.610> need

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
on-screen keyboard and they don't need

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.260 
on-screen keyboard and they don't need
the<00:01:45.940> extra<00:01:46.150> real<00:01:46.390> estate<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:47.010> believe<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.790> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
the extra real estate I believe that the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.480 
the extra real estate I believe that the
3.5<00:01:49.840> inch<00:01:50.020> display<00:01:50.380> offers<00:01:50.619> plenty<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.369> real

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
3.5 inch display offers plenty of real

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.800 
3.5 inch display offers plenty of real
estate<00:01:51.610> for<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.000> landscape<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
estate for the landscape and the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.440 
estate for the landscape and the
portrait<00:01:53.500> keyboard<00:01:54.280> which<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.270> main

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
portrait keyboard which is the main

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.640 
portrait keyboard which is the main
reason<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.990> enlargement<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
reason for the enlargement of the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.190 
reason for the enlargement of the
display<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.280> believe<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.450> also<00:01:58.780> that's<00:01:58.960> going

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
display I believe and also that's going

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.870 
display I believe and also that's going
to<00:01:59.260> screw<00:01:59.500> up<00:01:59.590> their<00:01:59.830> whole<00:02:00.159> Retina<00:02:00.520> display

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
to screw up their whole Retina display

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.300 
to screw up their whole Retina display
and<00:02:00.909> also<00:02:01.450> mining<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.900> change<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:03.130> whole

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and also mining it change the the whole

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.190 
and also mining it change the the whole
design<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.880> device<00:02:04.080> because<00:02:05.080> they

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
design of the device because they

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.539 
design of the device because they
already<00:02:05.290> have<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.740> they<00:02:06.159> wouldn't<00:02:06.340> need<00:02:06.490> to

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
already have it they wouldn't need to

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.070 
already have it they wouldn't need to
change<00:02:06.820> much<00:02:07.060> they<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:07.570> kept<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.840> screen

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
change much they just kept the screen

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.869 
change much they just kept the screen
size<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.439> same<00:02:08.679> but<00:02:09.280> i'm<00:02:09.369> not<00:02:09.519> sure<00:02:09.580> if<00:02:09.759> they

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
size the same but i'm not sure if they

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.659 
size the same but i'm not sure if they
can<00:02:10.030> make<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.179> another<00:02:10.450> year<00:02:10.899> if<00:02:11.280> their<00:02:12.280> market

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:12.669 
can make it another year if their market

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.410 
can make it another year if their market
share<00:02:12.700> will<00:02:13.029> decrease<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> lot<00:02:13.779> by

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
share will decrease a lot by

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.699 
share will decrease a lot by
keeping<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> size<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> screen<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.530> same

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
keeping the size of the screen the same

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.180 
keeping the size of the screen the same
as<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:18.230> alright<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.560> next<00:02:19.830> we're<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.129> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
as it is alright so next we're going to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.460 
as it is alright so next we're going to
move<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.879> cameras<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:22.019> now<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.260> have

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
move on to the cameras right now we have

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.080 
move on to the cameras right now we have
a<00:02:22.500> pretty<00:02:22.830> good<00:02:22.860> 5<00:02:23.129> megapixel<00:02:23.700> camera<00:02:24.060> with

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
a pretty good 5 megapixel camera with

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
a pretty good 5 megapixel camera with
flash<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:26.120> pretty<00:02:27.120> lacking<00:02:28.110> front-facing

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
flash and a pretty lacking front-facing

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.890 
flash and a pretty lacking front-facing
camera<00:02:29.370> it's<00:02:29.519> vga<00:02:29.849> quality<00:02:30.090> point<00:02:30.629> three

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
camera it's vga quality point three

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.149 
camera it's vga quality point three
megapixel<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:33.299> i<00:02:33.659> mean<00:02:33.870> when<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.920> if

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
megapixel so i mean when you can see if

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.860 
megapixel so i mean when you can see if
you<00:02:35.310> use<00:02:35.579> it<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.909> low<00:02:36.060> light<00:02:36.269> situation<00:02:36.750> it's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you use it in a low light situation it's

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.380 
you use it in a low light situation it's
very<00:02:37.019> grainy<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.610> i<00:02:38.879> mean<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.269> really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
very grainy it's not i mean it's really

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.809 
very grainy it's not i mean it's really
only<00:02:39.629> for<00:02:40.019> video<00:02:40.829> conferencing<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
only for video conferencing and the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.550 
only for video conferencing and the
video<00:02:42.150> conferencing<00:02:42.720> resolution<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.409> not

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
video conferencing resolution is not

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.670 
video conferencing resolution is not
very<00:02:44.129> good<00:02:44.459> right<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.239> as<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.349> tell<00:02:46.410> if

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
very good right now as you can tell if

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.740 
very good right now as you can tell if
you<00:02:46.739> use<00:02:46.950> facetime<00:02:47.370> before<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.420> that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
you use facetime before but as that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.809 
you use facetime before but as that
starts<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.109> increase<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.650> popularity<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
starts to increase in popularity and the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.000 
starts to increase in popularity and the
technology<00:02:51.180> advances<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> resolution

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
technology advances and the resolution

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.940 
technology advances and the resolution
can<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.590> important

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
can go up it's going to be important

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.130 
can go up it's going to be important
that<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.310> will<00:02:56.579> have<00:02:56.760> probably<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.420> 1.3

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that you will have probably a 1.3

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.720 
that you will have probably a 1.3
megapixel<00:02:58.650> camera<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.129> front<00:02:59.250> which<00:02:59.519> will

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
megapixel camera on the front which will

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.490 
megapixel camera on the front which will
be<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.569> little<00:03:00.720> bit<00:03:00.840> better<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.230> video

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
be a little bit better for video

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.839 
be a little bit better for video
conferencing<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.670> taking

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
conferencing and just taking

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.089 
conferencing and just taking
self-portraits<00:03:03.840> we're<00:03:04.500> about<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.739> back<00:03:04.920> do

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
self-portraits we're about the back do

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.229 
self-portraits we're about the back do
you<00:03:05.129> think<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:05.430> might<00:03:05.579> upgrade<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.090> 8

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
you think they might upgrade to 8

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.140 
you think they might upgrade to 8
megapixel<00:03:06.900> there<00:03:07.109> um<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:08.670> don't<00:03:08.760> think<00:03:08.909> there's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
megapixel there um I don't think there's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.030 
megapixel there um I don't think there's
a<00:03:09.239> need<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.319> mean<00:03:10.560> they<00:03:10.680> might<00:03:10.859> just

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
a need to but I mean they might just

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.990 
a need to but I mean they might just
keep<00:03:11.519> up<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.970> Joneses<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.920> um<00:03:14.220> right

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
keep up with the Joneses but um right

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.670 
keep up with the Joneses but um right
now<00:03:15.180> they're<00:03:15.510> five<00:03:15.870> megapixel<00:03:16.409> cameras

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
now they're five megapixel cameras

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.319 
now they're five megapixel cameras
sufficient<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.609> only<00:03:17.819> reason<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.180> would

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
sufficient the only reason they would

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.330 
sufficient the only reason they would
upgrade<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.870> two<00:03:19.319> da<00:03:19.440> megapixel<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.250> would

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
upgrade the two da megapixel that would

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.740 
upgrade the two da megapixel that would
probably<00:03:20.519> give<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> ability<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.569> go<00:03:21.599> to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
probably give them the ability to go to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.710 
probably give them the ability to go to
1080p<00:03:22.260> video<00:03:23.220> capture<00:03:23.280> which<00:03:23.940> would<00:03:24.209> make<00:03:24.660> it

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
1080p video capture which would make it

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.780 
1080p video capture which would make it
a<00:03:24.840> little<00:03:25.049> bit<00:03:25.260> more<00:03:25.440> comparable<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.549> some<00:03:26.730> of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
a little bit more comparable to some of

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.949 
a little bit more comparable to some of
the<00:03:26.880> higher-end<00:03:27.060> droids<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.630> are<00:03:27.720> coming

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the higher-end droids that are coming

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.839 
the higher-end droids that are coming
out<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.319> also<00:03:29.099> in<00:03:29.220> our<00:03:29.280> ipod<00:03:29.669> touch

prediction<00:03:30.329> video<00:03:30.419> i<00:03:30.599> said<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.049> they<00:03:31.230> might

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
prediction video i said that they might

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.860 
prediction video i said that they might
upgrade<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.700> ipod<00:03:33.000> touch<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> 5<00:03:33.720> megapixel

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
upgrade the ipod touch to a 5 megapixel

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.280 
upgrade the ipod touch to a 5 megapixel
which<00:03:34.530> would<00:03:34.709> mean<00:03:34.889> that<00:03:35.389> the<00:03:36.389> iphone<00:03:37.200> would

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
which would mean that the iphone would

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.229 
which would mean that the iphone would
probably<00:03:37.590> need<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.919> better<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:38.459> there's<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
probably need to be better so there's a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.330 
probably need to be better so there's a
more<00:03:40.230> noticeable<00:03:40.620> gap<00:03:40.829> between<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.220> two

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
more noticeable gap between the two

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.900 
more noticeable gap between the two
devices<00:03:41.810> okay<00:03:42.810> we're<00:03:42.930> gonna<00:03:43.019> start<00:03:43.290> with<00:03:43.349> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
devices okay we're gonna start with the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.659 
devices okay we're gonna start with the
internal<00:03:44.910> specs<00:03:45.480> uh<00:03:46.459> right<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.489> we're

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
internal specs uh right now we're

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.900 
internal specs uh right now we're
running<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.359> a4<00:03:49.019> chip<00:03:49.069> it's<00:03:50.069> under<00:03:50.459> clock<00:03:50.730> to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
running the a4 chip it's under clock to

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.259 
running the a4 chip it's under clock to
800<00:03:51.359> megahertz<00:03:51.629> but<00:03:52.019> it's<00:03:52.790> pretty<00:03:53.790> much<00:03:53.970> said

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
800 megahertz but it's pretty much said

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.360 
800 megahertz but it's pretty much said
to<00:03:54.389> have<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.019> 1<00:03:55.230> gigahertz<00:03:55.500> processor<00:03:55.799> a

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
to have a it's a 1 gigahertz processor a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.089 
to have a it's a 1 gigahertz processor a
single<00:03:56.790> core<00:03:56.970> as<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.079> can<00:03:58.349> as<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.919> all

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
single core as you can as you all

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.920 
single core as you can as you all
probably<00:03:59.129> know<00:03:59.609> if<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.000> don't<00:04:00.180> know<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.569> ipad

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
probably know if you don't know the ipad

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.659 
probably know if you don't know the ipad
2<00:04:01.139> has<00:04:01.260> come<00:04:01.410> out<00:04:01.560> pretty<00:04:01.769> actually<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.519> pretty

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
2 has come out pretty actually a pretty

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.759 
2 has come out pretty actually a pretty
long<00:04:02.819> time<00:04:03.030> ago<00:04:03.209> now<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:04.349> was<00:04:04.530> it's

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
long time ago now and it was it's

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.680 
long time ago now and it was it's
equipped<00:04:05.099> with<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.400> a5<00:04:05.879> chip<00:04:06.209> which<00:04:06.389> is<00:04:06.510> new

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
equipped with the a5 chip which is new

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.080 
equipped with the a5 chip which is new
from<00:04:06.959> apple<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.459> actually<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.819> 1

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
from apple that is actually a 1

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.890 
from apple that is actually a 1
gigahertz<00:04:09.449> dual-core<00:04:09.840> processor<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.900> we're

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
gigahertz dual-core processor so we're

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.110 
gigahertz dual-core processor so we're
thinking<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.440> it's<00:04:13.590> going<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.739> be<00:04:14.120> installed

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
thinking that it's going to be installed

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.000 
thinking that it's going to be installed
into<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.449> new<00:04:15.660> iphone<00:04:16.049> it'll<00:04:16.560> help<00:04:16.709> around

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
into the new iphone it'll help around

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.159 
into the new iphone it'll help around
the<00:04:17.099> new<00:04:17.280> iOS<00:04:17.459> that's<00:04:17.880> coming<00:04:18.150> out<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.479> we'll

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
the new iOS that's coming out and we'll

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.390 
the new iOS that's coming out and we'll
just<00:04:19.229> overall<00:04:19.650> make<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.919> experience<00:04:20.250> a

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
just overall make the experience a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.880 
just overall make the experience a
little<00:04:20.459> bit<00:04:20.609> better<00:04:21.139> right<00:04:22.139> now<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.380> iphone

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
little bit better right now the iphone

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.420 
little bit better right now the iphone
has<00:04:23.159> 512<00:04:24.030> megabytes<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.510> ram<00:04:25.039> which<00:04:26.039> they<00:04:26.219> just

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
has 512 megabytes of ram which they just

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.190 
has 512 megabytes of ram which they just
increased<00:04:26.820> from

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
increased from

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.500 
increased from
3gs<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.890> four<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.390> should

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
3gs to the four so I think that should

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.100 
3gs to the four so I think that should
be<00:04:29.630> sufficient<00:04:29.780> for<00:04:31.330> for<00:04:32.330> what<00:04:32.600> they're<00:04:32.990> going

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
be sufficient for for what they're going

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.660 
be sufficient for for what they're going
to<00:04:33.200> need<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.410> run<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.740> iOS<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:34.430> they're

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
to need to run on iOS because they're

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.330 
to need to run on iOS because they're
they're<00:04:35.210> operating<00:04:35.540> systems<00:04:35.870> are<00:04:36.440> famous<00:04:37.310> for

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
they're operating systems are famous for

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.420 
they're operating systems are famous for
taking<00:04:37.670> less<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.840> do<00:04:39.110> more<00:04:39.410> but<00:04:40.070> if<00:04:40.280> they're

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
taking less to do more but if they're

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.470 
taking less to do more but if they're
going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.610> upgrade<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.060> they're<00:04:41.210> just<00:04:41.390> going

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
going to upgrade it they're just going

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.200 
going to upgrade it they're just going
to<00:04:41.540> probably<00:04:42.200> upgrade<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.680> 768<00:04:43.640> megabytes

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
to probably upgrade it to 768 megabytes

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.860 
to probably upgrade it to 768 megabytes
which<00:04:44.720> would<00:04:44.930> be<00:04:45.110> plenty<00:04:45.980> o<00:04:46.220> can<00:04:46.550> tell<00:04:46.700> you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
which would be plenty o can tell you

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.120 
which would be plenty o can tell you
probably<00:04:47.870> going<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.140> keep<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.530> hard<00:04:48.950> drive

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
probably going to keep the hard drive

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.540 
probably going to keep the hard drive
size<00:04:49.310> is<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.730> same<00:04:49.940> um<00:04:50.980> maybe<00:04:51.980> they'll<00:04:52.310> add<00:04:52.520> a

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
size is the same um maybe they'll add a

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.470 
size is the same um maybe they'll add a
64<00:04:53.210> but<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.620> think<00:04:55.280> right<00:04:55.430> now<00:04:55.610> for<00:04:56.090> what<00:04:56.210> people

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
64 but I think right now for what people

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.660 
64 but I think right now for what people
really<00:04:56.720> need<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.050> for<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.350> 16<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.190> 32<00:04:58.520> were

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
really need it for the 16 of the 32 were

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.400 
really need it for the 16 of the 32 were
pretty<00:04:59.150> good<00:04:59.270> they<00:04:59.660> might<00:04:59.840> have<00:04:59.960> heard<00:05:00.200> rumors

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
pretty good they might have heard rumors

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.130 
pretty good they might have heard rumors
of<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.830> 3d<00:05:01.250> display<00:05:01.670> I<00:05:01.910> don't<00:05:02.480> think<00:05:02.630> apples

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
of a 3d display I don't think apples

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.810 
of a 3d display I don't think apples
gonna<00:05:03.290> get<00:05:03.440> into<00:05:03.650> that<00:05:03.770> market<00:05:04.010> honestly<00:05:04.640> I

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
gonna get into that market honestly I

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.700 
gonna get into that market honestly I
think<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.510> think<00:05:05.780> personally<00:05:06.170> everything

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
think I think personally everything

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.650 
think I think personally everything
three<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.130> just<00:05:07.310> horrible<00:05:07.520> yeah<00:05:08.060> at<00:05:08.510> this

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
three is just horrible yeah at this

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.070 
three is just horrible yeah at this
point<00:05:08.780> like<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.290> evo<00:05:09.560> 3d<00:05:09.950> um<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:11.330> looks<00:05:11.360> pretty

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
point like the evo 3d um it looks pretty

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.010 
point like the evo 3d um it looks pretty
thick<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.940> technology<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.510> 3d

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
thick and the technology that 3d

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.900 
thick and the technology that 3d
encompasses<00:05:15.680> needs<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.580> make<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.730> device

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
encompasses needs to make the device

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.760 
encompasses needs to make the device
very<00:05:17.270> large<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.660> apples<00:05:17.960> not<00:05:18.110> about<00:05:18.530> making

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
very large and apples not about making

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.010 
very large and apples not about making
their<00:05:19.010> device<00:05:19.250> large<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:20.240> also<00:05:20.540> heard<00:05:20.690> rumors

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
their device large so also heard rumors

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.750 
their device large so also heard rumors
of<00:05:21.760> getting<00:05:22.760> grants<00:05:22.910> that<00:05:24.310> makes<00:05:25.310> me<00:05:25.490> making

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
of getting grants that makes me making

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.730 
of getting grants that makes me making
in<00:05:25.850> a<00:05:25.910> touch<00:05:26.090> button<00:05:26.420> on<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.720> yeah<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.440> mean

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
in a touch button on that yeah I mean

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.180 
in a touch button on that yeah I mean
that<00:05:28.040> would<00:05:28.310> be<00:05:28.450> my<00:05:29.450> last<00:05:29.660> long<00:05:29.960> yeah<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:31.010> home

that would be my last long yeah the home

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.430 
that would be my last long yeah the home
buttons<00:05:31.490> are<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.580> little<00:05:31.790> bit<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.030> little<00:05:32.440> bit

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
buttons are a little bit a little bit

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.670

testy<00:05:33.710> on<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.600> iPhones<00:05:35.600> because<00:05:36.170> of<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.440> use

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
testy on the iPhones because of the use

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.540 
testy on the iPhones because of the use
it's<00:05:37.520> heavily<00:05:38.240> were<00:05:38.540> ever<00:05:39.130> heavily<00:05:40.130> relied<00:05:40.520> on

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
it's heavily were ever heavily relied on

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.320 
it's heavily were ever heavily relied on
in<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:41.660> OS<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.920> need<00:05:43.100> to<00:05:43.160> use<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.520> on<00:05:44.270> a

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
in the OS and you need to use it on a

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.790 
in the OS and you need to use it on a
regular<00:05:44.570> basis<00:05:45.170> there's<00:05:45.320> no<00:05:45.440> way<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.620> get

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
regular basis there's no way to get

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.730 
regular basis there's no way to get
around<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:46.250> so<00:05:46.880> it<00:05:46.910> might<00:05:47.750> be<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:47.960> smart<00:05:48.650> of

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
around it so it might be a smart of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.800 
around it so it might be a smart of
Apple<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.220> so<00:05:49.970> they<00:05:50.060> want<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:50.330> replace<00:05:50.630> so

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
Apple and so they want to replace so

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.780 
Apple and so they want to replace so
many<00:05:50.990> iphones<00:05:51.350> if<00:05:51.530> they<00:05:51.710> get<00:05:52.340> rid<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.640> home

think you're just going to see a new
iphone<00:06:00.380> I<00:06:00.410> mean<00:06:00.680> if<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.860> look<00:06:01.040> at<00:06:01.160> the<00:06:01.250> first

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
iphone I mean if you look at the first

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.250 
iphone I mean if you look at the first
generation<00:06:02.120> iphone<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.810> you<00:06:02.960> look<00:06:03.110> at<00:06:03.200> the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
generation iphone and you look at the

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.930 
generation iphone and you look at the
fourth<00:06:03.470> generation<00:06:03.890> iphone<00:06:04.220> at<00:06:04.640> a<00:06:04.700> quick

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
fourth generation iphone at a quick

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.210 
fourth generation iphone at a quick
glance<00:06:04.970> there<00:06:05.840> really<00:06:06.290> isn't<00:06:06.590> that<00:06:06.650> much<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:07.130> a

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
glance there really isn't that much of a

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.920 
glance there really isn't that much of a
difference<00:06:07.250> it's<00:06:08.000> been<00:06:08.210> upgraded<00:06:08.690> a<00:06:08.720> lot

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
difference it's been upgraded a lot

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.870 
difference it's been upgraded a lot
internally<00:06:09.440> and<00:06:09.830> it's<00:06:10.340> a<00:06:10.430> little<00:06:10.670> bit<00:06:10.760> of<00:06:10.820> a

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
internally and it's a little bit of a

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880 
internally and it's a little bit of a
different<00:06:11.210> design<00:06:11.450> but<00:06:11.780> when<00:06:12.560> you<00:06:12.620> come<00:06:12.740> down

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
different design but when you come down

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.590 
different design but when you come down
to<00:06:13.040> its<00:06:13.190> there's<00:06:13.430> still<00:06:13.670> both<00:06:13.970> great<00:06:14.270> devices

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
to its there's still both great devices

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.840 
to its there's still both great devices
and<00:06:15.080> i<00:06:15.740> think<00:06:16.100> apple's<00:06:16.460> just<00:06:16.580> going<00:06:16.760> to

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
and i think apple's just going to

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.580 
and i think apple's just going to
continue<00:06:17.180> with<00:06:17.600> that<00:06:17.720> they<00:06:18.080> already<00:06:18.260> know

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
continue with that they already know

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.230 
continue with that they already know
that<00:06:18.830> people<00:06:19.190> love<00:06:19.550> their<00:06:19.760> phone<00:06:19.940> so<00:06:20.120> they're

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
that people love their phone so they're

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.880 
that people love their phone so they're
not<00:06:20.330> going<00:06:20.390> to<00:06:20.570> change<00:06:20.720> too<00:06:20.930> much<00:06:20.960> oven<00:06:21.710> that

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
not going to change too much oven that

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.380 
not going to change too much oven that
would<00:06:22.070> upset<00:06:22.160> people<00:06:22.520> possibly<00:06:23.030> and<00:06:23.240> they

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
would upset people possibly and they

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.570 
would upset people possibly and they
would<00:06:23.540> lose<00:06:23.630> some<00:06:23.840> of<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:23.990> market<00:06:24.320> so<00:06:25.070> we're

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
would lose some of the market so we're

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.580 
would lose some of the market so we're
going<00:06:25.700> to<00:06:25.760> see<00:06:25.970> a<00:06:26.000> gray<00:06:26.420> phone<00:06:26.660> i<00:06:26.690> think<00:06:27.050> when

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
going to see a gray phone i think when

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.930 
going to see a gray phone i think when
you<00:06:27.740> say<00:06:27.890> this<00:06:28.040> would<00:06:28.190> be<00:06:28.340> more<00:06:28.490> of<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.670> jump

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
you say this would be more of a jump

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.090 
you say this would be more of a jump
between<00:06:29.170> the<00:06:30.170> second<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:30.680> third<00:06:31.040> rather<00:06:31.580> than

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
between the second and third rather than

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.930 
between the second and third rather than
in<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.310> fourth<00:06:32.630> in<00:06:33.630> terms<00:06:33.900> of<00:06:34.820> like<00:06:35.820> the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
in the fourth in terms of like the

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.020 
in the fourth in terms of like the
differences<00:06:36.450> you<00:06:36.840> know<00:06:36.870> I<00:06:36.960> mean<00:06:37.200> yeah<00:06:37.830> I<00:06:38.250> think

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
differences you know I mean yeah I think

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.110 
differences you know I mean yeah I think
it's<00:06:39.180> gonna<00:06:39.300> be<00:06:39.390> a<00:06:39.510> big<00:06:39.870> jump<00:06:40.200> but<00:06:40.560> uh<00:06:40.940> not<00:06:41.940> as

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
it's gonna be a big jump but uh not as

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.850 
it's gonna be a big jump but uh not as
me<00:06:42.360> not<00:06:42.690> as<00:06:42.750> big<00:06:43.080> as<00:06:43.230> between<00:06:43.560> the<00:06:43.650> third<00:06:43.830> and

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
me not as big as between the third and

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.510 
me not as big as between the third and
fourth<00:06:45.020> because<00:06:46.020> there<00:06:46.380> was<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:46.680> a<00:06:46.770> ton<00:06:47.490> of

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
fourth because there was just a ton of

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.340 
fourth because there was just a ton of
differences<00:06:48.090> between<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.450> 3gs<00:06:48.870> and<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.140> four

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
differences between the 3gs and the four

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.860 
differences between the 3gs and the four
I<00:06:49.380> mean<00:06:49.740> everything<00:06:50.610> down<00:06:51.000> from<00:06:51.330> down<00:06:51.630> to<00:06:51.750> the

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
I mean everything down from down to the

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.110 
I mean everything down from down to the
design<00:06:52.230> the<00:06:52.950> screen<00:06:53.370> resolution<00:06:53.940> the

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
design the screen resolution the

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.460 
design the screen resolution the
internal<00:06:54.600> specs<00:06:55.940> the<00:06:56.940> camera<00:06:57.570> pretty<00:06:58.350> much

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
internal specs the camera pretty much

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.810 
internal specs the camera pretty much
everything<00:06:58.890> was<00:06:59.160> different<00:06:59.280> and<00:06:59.610> I<00:06:59.670> don't

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
everything was different and I don't

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.970 
everything was different and I don't
think<00:07:00.000> apples<00:07:00.330> ready<00:07:00.540> to<00:07:00.780> quite<00:07:01.170> get<00:07:01.800> away

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
think apples ready to quite get away

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.350 
think apples ready to quite get away
from<00:07:02.040> this<00:07:02.280> design<00:07:02.580> that<00:07:02.910> pretty<00:07:03.210> much

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
from this design that pretty much

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.140 
from this design that pretty much
everybody's<00:07:03.750> learn<00:07:03.930> to<00:07:04.080> love<00:07:04.730> one<00:07:05.730> last<00:07:05.880> thing

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
everybody's learn to love one last thing

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.880 
everybody's learn to love one last thing
that<00:07:06.210> we<00:07:06.360> forgot<00:07:06.600> to<00:07:06.750> mention<00:07:07.080> is<00:07:07.320> the<00:07:07.350> type<00:07:07.860> of

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890 
that we forgot to mention is the type of
