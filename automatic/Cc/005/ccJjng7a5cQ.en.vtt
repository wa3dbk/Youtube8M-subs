to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> white<00:01:09.659> I'd<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.619> maybe<00:01:10.920> an<00:01:11.040> oil<00:01:11.340> or

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
to the white I'd use maybe an oil or

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
to the white I'd use maybe an oil or
grease<00:01:11.729> based<00:01:12.060> paint<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.689> either<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
grease based paint and either way I just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.940 
grease based paint and either way I just
applied<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.970> sponge<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.680> just

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
applied it with a sponge and then just

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
applied it with a sponge and then just
for<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> immediate<00:01:17.820> eye<00:01:18.090> area<00:01:18.420> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
for around the immediate eye area I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
for around the immediate eye area I
decided<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> fascination

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
decided to go back with the fascination

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
decided to go back with the fascination
I<00:01:20.640> call<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.810> Rim<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> eye<00:01:22.890> area

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520

and<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> eyelid<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.939> make<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and the eyelid with this to make it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.440 
and the eyelid with this to make it
really<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.330> white<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:32.759> set<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> white

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
really really white to set the white

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.390 
really really white to set the white
base<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.049> used<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.470> white<00:01:34.650> eye<00:01:34.710> shadow<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:35.340> my

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
base I used the white eye shadow from my

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.999 
base I used the white eye shadow from my
manly<00:01:35.850> palette<00:01:36.210> called<00:01:36.540> ice<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.740> actually

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
manly palette called ice it's actually

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.090 
manly palette called ice it's actually
kind<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> certainly<00:01:38.729> shimmery<00:01:39.150> color<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
kind of a certainly shimmery color and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.069 
kind of a certainly shimmery color and
so<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.490> gives<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.479> reflective<00:01:43.049> surface

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
so it gives more of a reflective surface

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
so it gives more of a reflective surface
and<00:01:43.860> kinda<00:01:44.280> adds<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.579> dimension<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
and kinda adds more dimension to the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
and kinda adds more dimension to the
face<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.750> preferred<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> brushed<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
face which I preferred so I brushed and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.380 
face which I preferred so I brushed and
pushed<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:49.020> into<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.159> white<00:01:50.729> cream<00:01:51.149> base

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
pushed that into the white cream base

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.820 
pushed that into the white cream base
and<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:52.560> over<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> face

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.010 

I<00:01:56.270> used<00:01:57.270> my<00:01:57.480> Ben<00:01:57.720> Nye<00:01:58.250> cake<00:01:59.250> eyeliner<00:01:59.730> cake<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
I used my Ben Nye cake eyeliner cake to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
I used my Ben Nye cake eyeliner cake to
draw<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.530> outline<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:02.010> Ryan<00:02:02.400> over<00:02:02.670> all<00:02:02.940> around

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
was max copper plate and I applied this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.430 
was max copper plate and I applied this
just<00:02:32.070> outside<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.940> black<00:02:33.120> line<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.810> around

next<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.150> used<00:03:00.440> typographic<00:03:01.440> which<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.739> an

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
next I used typographic which is an

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.610 
next I used typographic which is an
almost<00:03:02.190> black<00:03:02.580> really<00:03:03.299> dark<00:03:03.540> gray<00:03:03.750> color<00:03:03.780> and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
I dragon doubt some of the areas that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
I dragon doubt some of the areas that
would<00:03:07.260> naturally<00:03:07.319> be<00:03:08.159> darker<00:03:08.819> anywhere<00:03:09.180> would

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
would naturally be darker anywhere would

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.990 
would naturally be darker anywhere would
that<00:03:09.569> be<00:03:09.750> any<00:03:10.349> indentations<00:03:10.799> on<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.400> face<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that be any indentations on the face so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.550 
that be any indentations on the face so
around<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.420> hollows<00:03:12.659> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.840> cheeks<00:03:13.230> around

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
around the hollows of the cheeks around

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.039 
around the hollows of the cheeks around
the<00:03:13.769> temples<00:03:14.250> just<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.150> make<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> mask<00:03:15.780> a

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
the temples just to make the mask a

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:24.380 
the temples just to make the mask a
little<00:03:16.290> bit<00:03:16.560> more<00:03:16.739> three-dimensional<00:03:23.299> next<00:03:24.299> I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
little bit more three-dimensional next I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.360 
little bit more three-dimensional next I
got<00:03:24.510> more<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.959> medium<00:03:25.500> gray<00:03:25.860> which<00:03:26.340> is
