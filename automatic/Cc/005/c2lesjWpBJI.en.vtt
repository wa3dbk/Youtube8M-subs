00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.200
 we are in 2014 it is world year and the 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.910
 most important brands have already made a 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.300
 specific projection for this great 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.160
 event 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.930
 adidas has just sent us this 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.939
 box and it says that inside contains the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.500
 battle pack and it's the combination of all 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.850
 the boots that the players will wear 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.850
 during the world cup 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 At first glance we see that the colors are 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.660
 common for all the boots and now 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.280
 we are going to do the analysis of the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.079
 boot designed to fit the players 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.920
 fastest of adidas adizero brand 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.920
 f50 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.829
 the combination of colors that we can 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 be battle pack is black and white is 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 a discarding the areas of adidas 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.829
 which are marked in bright orange 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.539
 which represent the colors of the trophy 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.940
 of the world cup the rest of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.100
 boot combination is 50% white 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.399
 and 50% black this wants to represent 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.950
 the arid slogan of all or nothing 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.840
 the all or nothing raisin round or that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.369
 have you removed and is represented from this 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.259
 so characteristic way that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.820
 represent the different 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.940
 Different painting decorations for 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.130
 face used by the warrior tribes of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.659
 Brazil is a boot c's with which 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 have lost and present battle with 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 that players are going to battle 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 which is a world cup in this 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.100
 If we model 1850 model 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.229
 lightest of the entire collection the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.729
 battle pack designed to fit the feet 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.890
 of the players that want to boost 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.420
 to the maximum its speed and this how it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.819
 So get yourself making a boot as 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.039
 possible light on this occasion the 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.050
 material chosen as you know for the 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.020
 new collections 10 050 is the hybrid 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.369
 which replaces the previous sprint skin and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.850
 brick touch is the material that is already 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.280
 use 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.200
 predator like the nitro but in this 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.330
 much lighter occasion to get 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.740
 have more lightness and that the game feels 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.960
 that you can cut your speed to the maximum 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.090
 more lightly we lose grip with the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.520
 correct ball but adidas improves it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.810
 introducing a tissue that we see 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.760
 as in silicone in the areas of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.230
 Contact the text is called drive that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.209
 what he is going to do is give us more grip 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 with the ball and especially an extra 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.739
 armed without increasing the final weight of the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.390
 boot cities in such a light boot is 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.860
 very important to get stability and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.260
 there enters one of the most important elements 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.489
 characteristic of line 10 050 that 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.590
 has been incorporated into many of the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.050
 previous of the different threads that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.550
 has adidas and is the sprint frame of 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.170
 marked fingers in this area is this 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.840
 heel was that it joins directly with the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.940
 sole with a small intermediate layer 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.860
 what he's going to achieve is to stabilize 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.110
 the tread for side performances and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.880
 get a cushioning state these 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.830
 Central bands are going to help us 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.060
 they are going to help that the tongue is not 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.799
 displaced is a boot that what 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.660
 pretend is to have maximum speed 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.400
 maximum stability therefore not suitable 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.950
 move it to release hitting areas 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.880
 since we would lose stability in 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.620
 career 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.420
 and for the template 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.860
 we find an ultra template 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.989
 light that has been borrowed 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.430
 Special attention to the material on which 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.780
 we are going to support the foot so that there 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.890
 no kind of slip when 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.840
 we run at full speed one of the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.670
 areas that have evolved the most in a 1950 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.349
 is the area of ​​the sole if the players 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.610
 pretend to run with this boot to maximum 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.409
 speed one of the most things 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.000
 important that we have to handle is 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.220
 the attraction of those played on the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.290
 This is why we have redesigned the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.959
 Traditional traction tacos to create 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 the traction speed traction speed is a 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.040
 widening of one of the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.079
 edges of each cue to get 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.000
 have traction only on that 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.560
 direction in such a way that whatever 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.030
 the address on which we run work 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.190
 that we make a change of pace always 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.420
 let's have an extra taco traction 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.340
 center that will help us swing 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.090
 while the heel plugs yes 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.049
 that have the usual traction taco 2.0 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.420
 these boots of the few that still 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.250
 maintains the maicon sensor 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.870
 and it's a boot that seeks to enhance the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.520
 speed because today is a parameter that 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.099
 adidas gives us the opportunity to 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.330
 we can assess both speed and 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.040
 the sprint number is what we do with 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.040
 our difference 50 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.290
 you already know 10 050 the lightest boot 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.820
 of the entire collection the battle pack of 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.330
 adidas for the world cup of brazil 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.330
 2014
