00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.309

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.379
 help others if there are many who 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.760
 do it very badly because I see 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.170

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.140

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.829
 here is the game does not come out officially 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.900
 and right and all that good so the 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.489
 briefer a little bit and after the person goes there 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.730
 to come here I would like to 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.010
 cool during my game the game gta 5 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.549
 my son this is his birthday a 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.510
 bullshit anywhere you put a little 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.560
 fed up with 10 years old here I am not 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.850
 too much how it works I was told 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.170
 maybe you will not have it I know 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.730
 not how it works 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.660
 after the the seller explained good ago 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.030
 always cost heads that you 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.180
 will say either name or which you can 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.100
 not too bad he will always have it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.810
 like that then you 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.940
 so the person is going to talk with the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.830
 seller and so we're a little bit of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.450
 information how does it work and the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.750
 already someone from the seller much more 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.250
 reassured because I was less already I 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 I would say I know some monarch m 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 on the city 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.280
 many do not trust my game 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.780
 understand you have young people who are going 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.700

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.410
 the game they will scream everywhere on all 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 the roofs that you to be safe and 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.070
 certain 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.690
 it's clear while the person will have 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.120
 a mature person in front of her to say 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.680
 Okay here's ok, I'm telling you this is my 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.270
 flesh my game the game can not go out 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.950
 before that date because we had 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.540
 rules we can have fines we can 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.440
 to be punished here you are talking about that the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.880
 nobody after the person in front of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.280
 your family or other 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.420
 good ah and everything but you know you 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 do not see a problem I mean it's 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.590
 just for a gift there is no need for 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.450
 shout on all the roofs that's what a 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.070
 game or other 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.600
 the seller will already be much more 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.160
 reassured his point he told a rapt age 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.240
 mature person right me all that that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.740
 not walk every time I'm 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.390
 okay but if you try that on 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.040
 five stores or from which you 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.410
 chances to see her four days before 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.820
 easily here I do not know if I was 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.630
 pretty clear the gameplay is pretty short 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.860
 so if you have other questions 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.870
 ask this moment on twitter 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.030
 maybe I was pretty fast 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.950
 your I'm sorry but here I think 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.360
 that it's still understood the purpose and 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.330
