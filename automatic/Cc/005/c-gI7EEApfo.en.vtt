in<00:00:11.050> this<00:00:11.230> scenario<00:00:11.410> the<00:00:12.040> customer<00:00:12.430> has

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
in this scenario the customer has

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.630 
in this scenario the customer has
brought<00:00:12.760> us<00:00:12.910> a<00:00:13.030> 2003<00:00:13.840> Dodge<00:00:14.110> Ram<00:00:14.440> 1500<00:00:15.010> pickup

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
brought us a 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.900 
brought us a 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup
4x4<00:00:16.390> with<00:00:16.870> a<00:00:16.930> 5.9<00:00:17.560> liter<00:00:17.590> engine<00:00:18.190> the<00:00:18.550> customer

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
4x4 with a 5.9 liter engine the customer

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.400 
4x4 with a 5.9 liter engine the customer
complaint<00:00:19.360> is<00:00:19.630> he's<00:00:19.780> got<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:19.960> check<00:00:20.230> engine

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
complaint is he's got a check engine

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.200 
complaint is he's got a check engine
light<00:00:20.560> on<00:00:20.800> and<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.310> vehicle<00:00:21.610> doesn't<00:00:21.940> want<00:00:22.120> to

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
light on and the vehicle doesn't want to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.040 
light on and the vehicle doesn't want to
shift<00:00:22.390> properly

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
shift properly

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.300 
shift properly
now<00:00:23.200> we've<00:00:23.350> already<00:00:23.530> hooked<00:00:23.830> up<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.070> scan

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
now we've already hooked up the scan

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.100 
now we've already hooked up the scan
tool<00:00:24.490> once<00:00:24.760> again<00:00:25.030> in<00:00:25.180> extracted<00:00:25.690> codes<00:00:25.900> and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
tool once again in extracted codes and

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.980 
tool once again in extracted codes and
we<00:00:26.590> found<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:26.949> piece<00:00:27.210> 1762<00:00:28.210> code<00:00:28.539> stored<00:00:28.900> in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
we found a piece 1762 code stored in

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.480 
we found a piece 1762 code stored in
memory<00:00:29.199> so<00:00:29.740> let's<00:00:29.920> go<00:00:30.039> ahead<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.310> enter<00:00:30.369> that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
and sure enough I have a repair track on

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.779 
and sure enough I have a repair track on
this<00:00:48.280> exact<00:00:48.670> code<00:00:48.940> piece<00:00:49.870> 1762<00:00:50.739> stored<00:00:51.190> so

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
this exact code piece 1762 stored so

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.869 
this exact code piece 1762 stored so
what<00:00:51.999> is<00:00:52.179> a<00:00:52.449> piece<00:00:52.749> 1762<00:00:54.510> let's<00:00:55.510> find<00:00:55.749> out<00:00:56.879> okay

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
what is a piece 1762 let's find out okay

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.289 
what is a piece 1762 let's find out okay
P<00:00:58.539> 1762<00:00:59.379> indicates<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.519> problem<00:01:00.940> with<00:01:01.179> the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
P 1762 indicates a problem with the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.809 
P 1762 indicates a problem with the
governor<00:01:01.719> pressure<00:01:02.109> sensor<00:01:02.799> that's<00:01:03.429> hard<00:01:03.670> to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
governor pressure sensor that's hard to

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.929 
governor pressure sensor that's hard to
read<00:01:03.999> so<00:01:04.420> once<00:01:04.600> again<00:01:05.399> let's<00:01:06.399> open<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.670> up<00:01:06.789> so

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
read so once again let's open that up so

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.819 
read so once again let's open that up so
it<00:01:07.119> makes<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.450> easy<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:08.079> is<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.320> classic

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
it makes it easy this is a classic

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.050 
it makes it easy this is a classic
example<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.369> what<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.490> talked<00:01:09.789> about<00:01:09.909> earlier

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
example of what I talked about earlier

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.289 
example of what I talked about earlier
in<00:01:10.780> terms<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:11.380> sometimes<00:01:12.219> a<00:01:12.460> drivability

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299

in terms of sometimes a drivability
problem<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:14.289> is<00:01:14.560> gonna<00:01:14.799> manifest<00:01:15.189> itself<00:01:15.729> as

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
problem that is gonna manifest itself as

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.789 
problem that is gonna manifest itself as
a<00:01:15.969> check<00:01:16.240> engine<00:01:16.420> light<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.350> think<00:01:17.649> it's

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
a check engine light and you think it's

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.679 
a check engine light and you think it's
engine<00:01:18.130> related<00:01:18.579> is<00:01:18.729> not<00:01:18.939> actually<00:01:19.390> engine

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
engine related is not actually engine

problem transmission related at this

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.109 
problem transmission related at this
point<00:01:23.500> but<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.979> code<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.490> actually<00:01:24.640> showing
