take<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> three<00:00:26.970> sections<00:00:27.240> side<00:00:28.080> middle<00:00:28.680> side

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
take the three sections side middle side

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.720 
take the three sections side middle side
middle<00:00:30.300> goes<00:00:30.449> down<00:00:31.099> her<00:00:32.099> hair's<00:00:32.340> really

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
middle goes down her hair's really

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
middle goes down her hair's really
really<00:00:33.149> kind<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.450> thin<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.620> actually

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
really kind of thin up here so actually

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.330 
really kind of thin up here so actually
may<00:00:35.399> take<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.780> less<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.230> tuft<00:00:37.680> just

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
may take a little less of that tuft just

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
may take a little less of that tuft just
because<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.180> hair<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.989> work

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
because the more hair you have to work

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
because the more hair you have to work
with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> least<00:00:41.160> amount<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> hair<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:42.090> going

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
with the least amount of hair it's going

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
with the least amount of hair it's going
to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.390> hard<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> made<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> little

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to be hard so I made that just a little

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.150 
to be hard so I made that just a little
bit<00:00:44.850> smaller<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> tuft<00:00:45.539> alright<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
bit smaller that tuft alright so this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
bit smaller that tuft alright so this
