00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello and welcome together 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.589
 to a new on the boxing video of me 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.929
 and today from the sony hdr cx 220 one 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.880
 beginner camcorder for around 230 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.230
 euro and here we see the front page 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.700
 the packaging here is such a mountain 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
 information, of course 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.650
 for example, carl zeiss lens up 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.840
 to 1080p full hd recording you could 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.449
 take pictures here with even 8 megapixel 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.189
 had 32 times zoom and so on and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 so definitely the camera here 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 that can do a lot and is too 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 still very small that they are the names 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 later so then we turn the whole 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.100
 here on the page are still standing 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.660
 So a few accessories on it you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.760
 can buy to it and maybe 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
 Also, for example, should be an external 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.899
 battery charger otherwise you can the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 Camera only with the integrated usb 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.610
 cable s.Computer load or stop 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.850
 on such a socket socket 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 for example, like that of an iphone 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.199
 4s 3gs anyway and yes here stand 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.079
 on the side a few more 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 information so more information 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.949
 a thing to me for example 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.719
 important was that you directly with it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.000
 imovie can work just for that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.920
 have mac user very interesting here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.020
 we will have more features 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 and functions, for example, steadyshot 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 So anti-blur just for the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 a bit shaky hands have a lot 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.150
 very well 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 yes seen here from above the packaging as 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.840
 we have a little baby white lollipop 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.759
 gets very cute and down here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.040
 of course all the obligatory 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.600
 Information that has as good as on 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 stand up to any product that believes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 I really no one like that yet 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.790
 I also read through myself 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.570
 not I show it to you only times 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.280
 and that's the way it will be 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.930
 we open the whole packaging times and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.130
 look at what you have included 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.439
 is probably always like sony 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.149
 a wealth of information 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.530
 leaflets what do we have here first 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:58.369
 nice registration card for sony de 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 very interesting then next 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.579
 accessory leaflet what to look beautiful 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.899
 Everything can be bought at the price 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.090
 to push up a bit 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.409
 then a guarantee card those 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.840
 of course always be there 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.610
 with receipt to unload finished 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.129
 and then it works here now I think 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.540
 Let's start with some instructions 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.019
 probably speaking again in all languages 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.019
 this earth 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.480
 12 pretty thick all that too 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.410
 three so now you can already 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.269
 Let's see where the weight of the packaging 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.860
 it comes only instructions for it 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.629
 are probably several rainforests 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 died 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.160
 yes, but that was it so far 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.130
 but I still show up at the same time 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.450
 in short so here you have a whole 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.220
 Bible on the table if you only 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.660
 the individual instructions rausholt and it 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.170
 is in principle always the same only 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.160
 just in a variety of languages 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.519
 You could actually go somewhere 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.720
 I find exciting but anyway so there 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.970
 definitely have the individual 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:08.040
 Let's look at how many stitches 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:10.440
 that in 123456 exactly and here under the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.060
 cap then puts the camera and what 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.130
 as it is included , let's have a look 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.410
 of course, right now because that's it 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.880
 actually that's interesting here 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.680
 and here on the left we definitely see 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.799
 ever the battery I get sometimes as 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.450
 first out 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.220
 Let's see how small or how big 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.829
 but he really is like that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.319
 small so that goes over two 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:35.099
 fingertips or soy good maybe 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.000
 also three but more like 2 yourself 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.250
 small the part 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.959
 I wonder if that's enough 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.959
 is for the camera so that the battery 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.599
 also holds long enough because you want to yes 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.639
 not necessarily that only 20 minutes 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.389
 can make videos or so then have 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.160
 Here we have a USB extension cable 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.079
 there you can see the usb 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.780
 Camera from the camera then stuck 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.410
 but then still and then have the same 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.150
 Of course we have a hdmi cable here 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.260
 So that the camera directly to the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
 TV can connect 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.889
 to get the results right there 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.109
 to be able to look for who it is not 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.579
 would like to edit or something and then 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.470
 Of course we have that here 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.169
 main feature of the whole the camera 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.849
 even I'll get out now times 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.560
 yes and as you can see here is otherwise 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.340
 nothing more in there no charger 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.690
 or something else what you do 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.010
 maybe just good 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.650
 or something in the past 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.030
 Actually it was always that way 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.220
 no matter we look at it all now 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.040
 First of all here and then I'll get 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.540
 the camera out of here when I get out of here 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.770
 do not get me all fingers 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.260
 break 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.900
 it does not work like that, I think so 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.180
 must take the second hand to it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.889
 right now at the camera 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.320
 stuck and yes so comes already small 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:57.340
 now anno 40 annoying youtube 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.970
 see out moment okay so there she is in 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.250
 blue 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.110
 why not in blue because i'm in blue 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.240
 have fetish or something or 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.460
 fresh blue or we call it like it 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.320
 in the blue base just want for me 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.620
 had been much cheaper I had them 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.260
 bought at a gros electromarkt and 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.060
 had now paid exactly 222 euros for it 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.680
 in all other colors would have clear 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.720
 More tasted therefore I had 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.240
 thought come on shit on the color take 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.310
 So the color meadow is just up 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.410
 we see definitely up here we have 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.330
 the controls for xoom so forward and 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.550
 back here, so to speak 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.860
 Shooting button here we see the usb 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.020
 cable directly in the wrist strap with 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.940
 there you can to pull out teeth but 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.580
 you see a USB cable so nothing 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.880
 great special here about the clip 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.400
 switch for the valve lid prior to 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.860
 valve cover for the flap on the front 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.419
 the objective so down here have the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.820
 small socket for the memory card like that 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.539
 and here we have in any case the 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.610
 screen 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.510
 I'm doing now, of course, out 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:08.410
 so that you can see it once 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.750
 In any case , I have been here very much 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.729
 small the whole now has my camera 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.740
 also here a pretty strong one 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.710
 Bildrauschen super moment I have to 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.849
 just focus on it again and again 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.070
 we have it up here, we have it 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.070
 a small navigation button and 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.780
 So have a lot to play button 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.020
 understand there are I do not think 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.580
 but that's the way it should be 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.800
 the quality has been doing so far 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.260
 lala impression we definitely have 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.290
 the 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:43.640
 hdmi output and here we have again 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:44.870
 or microcrystalline or speakers and so 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.270
 Here we are only from the 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.350
 Here is the wrist strap again 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.270
 I 'll just see if I'm just something 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:55.070
 forgot to show you or otherwise 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.810
 I do not want that right here 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:01.160
 but in any case a little 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:08.030
 Input as you can see is still multi 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:11.540
 another contagion ctio just like that 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:14.030
 Let 's shut up yes 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.260
 and also material from the camera we 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:21.050
 have here completely noble plastic 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.670
 really complete plastic that has me 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.590
 even in the shop disturbed but all 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.990
 camcorders in this price range exist 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.430
 plastic today and it does indeed 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.200
 metallic impression but if you have it 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.550
 It does not feel that way in hand 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.140
 really sturdy 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.600
 I'll just let me surprise you 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.310
 what the next two weeks bring 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.440
 then i will have another test 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.020
 Video on the camera and make a 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.490
 conclusion also to a purchase recommendation 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.590
 or just not 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.110
 and yes, I'll take a look 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:52.670
 I can find them all at once 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:54.560
 From the optics pretty cool what I am 

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:58.340
 so a bit in the eye of course pushes 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.500
 once here by usb the whole load and 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.900
 the usb cable you see is pretty short 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.910
 that's why the extension cable needs to open 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.470
 every turn 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.000
 yes but otherwise carl zeiss objectively 

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.030
 is actually always quite good for 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.150
 quality so what better is there 

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.590
 not and yes I say one again 

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.910
 nice day together until the next
