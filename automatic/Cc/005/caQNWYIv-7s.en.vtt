close-up<00:04:21.600> right<00:04:23.479> enough<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:36.139> don't<00:04:37.139> any

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
close-up right enough I don't any

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.730 
close-up right enough I don't any
opinions<00:04:39.180> on<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.660> there<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:43.080> back<00:04:43.260> is<00:04:43.290> not

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
opinions on that there the back is not

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.740 
opinions on that there the back is not
curly<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.580> pay<00:04:44.940> attention<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.540> tongue

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
curly so pay attention to the tongue

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.469 
curly so pay attention to the tongue
cleanly<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:47.280> ends<00:04:47.669> still<00:04:48.150> don't<00:04:48.300> look

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
cleanly and the ends still don't look

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:59.999 
cleanly and the ends still don't look
right<00:04:48.690> but<00:04:48.990> that's<00:04:49.110> probably<00:04:49.380> just<00:04:49.530> because

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:06.089 

I<00:05:04.080> think<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.139> idea<00:05:05.439> actually<00:05:05.559> is<00:05:05.830> a<00:05:05.860> curling

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
I think of idea actually is a curling

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.859 
I think of idea actually is a curling
iron<00:05:06.279> i<00:05:06.639> think<00:05:06.879> it<00:05:06.939> would<00:05:07.059> look<00:05:07.119> better<00:05:07.379> but<00:05:08.379> um

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:09.869 
iron i think it would look better but um

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:14.100 
iron i think it would look better but um
