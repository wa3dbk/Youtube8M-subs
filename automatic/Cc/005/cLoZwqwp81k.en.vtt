you know do whatever scouting we had to

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.390 
you know do whatever scouting we had to
do<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.450> then<00:00:34.960> have<00:00:35.410> one<00:00:35.650> person<00:00:35.860> get<00:00:36.130> down<00:00:36.280> to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
do and then have one person get down to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.030 
do and then have one person get down to
the<00:00:36.460> bottom<00:00:36.700> with<00:00:37.270> enough<00:00:37.600> time<00:00:37.840> to<00:00:38.260> still

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
the bottom with enough time to still

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.319 
the bottom with enough time to still
catch<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.340> ride<00:00:39.520> with<00:00:39.550> someone<00:00:39.700> going<00:00:40.060> up<00:00:40.210> to

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
catch a ride with someone going up to

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.760 
catch a ride with someone going up to
the<00:00:40.420> top<00:00:40.600> because<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.200> couldn't<00:00:41.350> have<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.590> car

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
the top because we couldn't have the car

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.500 
the top because we couldn't have the car
up<00:00:41.860> there<00:00:41.980> obviously<00:00:42.190> because<00:00:42.730> we<00:00:43.090> kicked<00:00:43.360> out

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
up there obviously because we kicked out

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.479 
up there obviously because we kicked out
so<00:00:43.840> I<00:00:44.079> mean<00:00:44.530> our<00:00:44.620> only<00:00:44.770> option<00:00:45.160> was<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.310> just

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
so I mean our only option was to just

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.490 
so I mean our only option was to just
parked<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.880> van<00:00:46.000> at<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.239> bottom<00:00:46.539> and<00:00:46.690> try<00:00:47.440> to

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
parked the van at the bottom and try to

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.430 
parked the van at the bottom and try to
hitchhike<00:00:47.680> back<00:00:47.859> up<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:49.870> stop<00:00:50.199> letting
