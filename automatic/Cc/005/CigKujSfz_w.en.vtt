00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.670
 this is a sponsored video tutorial 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.020
 for promising sale and technical service 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.020
 used cell phones in bogotÃ¡ 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.590
 to set a special tone to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.240
 messages of our applications 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.070
 messaging like the whatsapp 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.600
 in our devices with system 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.310
 operative android we should do what 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 next let's start 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 I am the application you will find foresight 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.730
 google the top right we're going to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.260
 find the search bar we're going to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.260
 look for an application that is called 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 Guo and written 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.570
 and always free 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.550
 we are going to install a version we accept and 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.710
 we download the contract 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.739
 and we wait while you download the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.739
 application 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.110
 not only allows you to configure ringtones for 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.360
 the messaging applications also 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.990
 allows you to configure for new emails and 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.409
 other things 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.360
 we are going to open 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.470
 it gives us a 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.470
 welcome screen 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.030
 well the first thing we can do is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.020
 look in the preferences 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.020
 for example 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.580
 of text messages 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.030
 we go set 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 a tone for text messages that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.820
 get us to set up vibration for 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.640
 each one and a series of 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.740
 elements in which we can define 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.350
 a tone and in the sequence of vibrations 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.490
 are the text messages are new 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.490
 emails 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.450
 the contacts 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.899
 in this way we can go configuring or 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.340
 customizing our system 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.550
 operative android our device 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 so that it is more to less than what 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.760
 we are 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.440
