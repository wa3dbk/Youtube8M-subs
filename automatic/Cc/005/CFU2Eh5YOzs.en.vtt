00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.980 

see<00:00:04.350> day<00:00:05.279> 9<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.819> think<00:00:06.090> that<00:00:06.240> auto<00:00:06.450> turrets

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
see day 9 do you think that auto turrets

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.230 
see day 9 do you think that auto turrets
are<00:00:07.140> more<00:00:07.590> reliable<00:00:07.950> than<00:00:08.280> hunter<00:00:08.849> seeker

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
are more reliable than hunter seeker

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000 
are more reliable than hunter seeker
missiles<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.559> have<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.830> upgrade

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
missiles for one you have to upgrade

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.860 
missiles for one you have to upgrade
hunter<00:00:11.460> seeker<00:00:11.760> missiles<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.300> there's<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
hunter seeker missiles and there's a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.720 
hunter seeker missiles and there's a
chance<00:00:13.140> for<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:13.560> to<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.890> any<00:00:14.100> damage<00:00:14.430> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
chance for it not to do any damage and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.769 
chance for it not to do any damage and
it's<00:00:15.090> even<00:00:15.690> more<00:00:16.019> energy<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.769> cast<00:00:17.130> I

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
it's even more energy to cast I

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's even more energy to cast I
definitely<00:00:19.250> hmm<00:00:20.250> that's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> tough<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
definitely hmm that's a tough one I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.450 
definitely hmm that's a tough one I
think<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.490> hmm<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> range<00:00:24.810> nine<00:00:25.460> that

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
think that hmm with the range nine that

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
think that hmm with the range nine that
the<00:00:26.760> hunter<00:00:27.210> seeker<00:00:27.449> missile<00:00:27.690> he<00:00:27.779> used<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the hunter seeker missile he used to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.330 
the hunter seeker missile he used to
have<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.380> would<00:00:28.619> say<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.860> hunter<00:00:29.070> seeker

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
have I would say the hunter seeker

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.130 
have I would say the hunter seeker
missiles<00:00:29.699> are<00:00:29.910> pretty<00:00:30.449> damn<00:00:30.690> good<00:00:30.900> especially

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
missiles are pretty damn good especially

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.529 
missiles are pretty damn good especially
dealing<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.680> hydras<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.390> hunter

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
dealing with hydras but now that hunter

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.099 
dealing with hydras but now that hunter
secret<00:00:33.809> missiles<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> same<00:00:34.649> range

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
secret missiles have the same range

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.809 
secret missiles have the same range
single<00:00:37.109> missile<00:00:37.289> cast<00:00:37.739> range<00:00:37.949> is<00:00:38.249> six<00:00:38.609> and

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
single missile cast range is six and

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:40.969 
single missile cast range is six and
makes<00:00:39.449> them<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:39.780> ineffective<00:00:40.319> against

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
makes them very ineffective against

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.629 
makes them very ineffective against
hydras<00:00:41.609> maybe<00:00:42.359> ok-ish<00:00:43.199> against<00:00:43.649> roaches<00:00:44.069> but

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:44.639 
hydras maybe ok-ish against roaches but

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:45.799 
hydras maybe ok-ish against roaches but
I<00:00:44.699> think<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:44.969> number<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.449> thing<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> they'd

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I think the number one thing that they'd

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.809 
I think the number one thing that they'd
be<00:00:45.899> useful<00:00:46.229> against<00:00:46.559> would<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.829> banelings<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
be useful against would be banelings the

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.009 
be useful against would be banelings the
fact<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.089> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.420> cast<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.839> hunter

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
fact that you can just cast a hunter

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.389 
fact that you can just cast a hunter
seeker<00:00:49.260> missile<00:00:49.559> while<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:49.889> backing<00:00:50.280> up

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
seeker missile while you're backing up

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
seeker missile while you're backing up
with<00:00:50.579> everything<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.659> you<00:00:51.749> know<00:00:51.839> you<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.170> up

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
with everything so you know you back up

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.079 
with everything so you know you back up
with<00:00:52.499> your<00:00:52.679> Marines<00:00:52.979> your<00:00:53.339> ravens<00:00:53.729> up<00:00:53.879> here

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
with your Marines your ravens up here

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.430 
with your Marines your ravens up here
shoot<00:00:54.359> the<00:00:54.449> hunter<00:00:54.659> seeker<00:00:54.929> missiles<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
shoot the hunter seeker missiles and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.020 
shoot the hunter seeker missiles and
then<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.859> back<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.339> while<00:00:56.609> the<00:00:56.729> missile

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
then they all back up while the missile

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.509 
then they all back up while the missile
crashes<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.959> a<00:00:57.989> baneling<00:00:58.229> so<00:00:59.159> that<00:00:59.489> i

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
crashes down on a baneling so that i

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.529 
crashes down on a baneling so that i
think<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> great<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.319> auto<00:01:01.499> turrets<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
think is great but um the auto turrets I

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.609 
think is great but um the auto turrets I
would<00:01:03.539> say<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.749> if<00:01:04.049> you're<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.379> long<00:01:04.530> as

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
would say that if you're as long as

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.690 
would say that if you're as long as
you're<00:01:04.710> getting<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> upgrades<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.519> them

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you're getting the upgrades for them

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010 
you're getting the upgrades for them
which<00:01:06.270> again<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.780> them<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
which again you can get them at the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.390 
which again you can get them at the
engineering<00:01:07.290> Bay<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> would<00:01:08.190> be<00:01:08.250> an

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
engineering Bay I think that would be an

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.180 
engineering Bay I think that would be an
awesome<00:01:08.870> way<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.230> a<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.890> more

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
awesome way to be a little bit more

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.980 
awesome way to be a little bit more
effective<00:01:11.850> auto<00:01:12.090> turrets<00:01:12.450> seem<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> good

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
effective auto turrets seem like a good

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.720 
effective auto turrets seem like a good
general<00:01:13.470> thing<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.100> harass<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.610> them

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
general thing you can harass with them

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.080 
general thing you can harass with them
all<00:01:14.940> that<00:01:15.390> good<00:01:15.570> stuff<00:01:15.600> um<00:01:16.400> they<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.760> act<00:01:17.910> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
all that good stuff um they they act as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
all that good stuff um they they act as
meat<00:01:18.330> shield<00:01:18.660> again<00:01:19.200> especially<00:01:19.410> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.800> get

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
meat shield again especially if you get

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
meat shield again especially if you get
the<00:01:20.070> engineering<00:01:20.460> Bay<00:01:20.550> upgrades<00:01:20.970> hunter

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the engineering Bay upgrades hunter

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.670 
the engineering Bay upgrades hunter
secret<00:01:22.020> missiles<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> seemed

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
secret missiles just seemed

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.130 
secret missiles just seemed
extraordinarily<00:01:23.690> situational<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:24.930> right

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
extraordinarily situational to me right

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
extraordinarily situational to me right
now<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:26.010> is<00:01:26.190> nice<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.760> with<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.360> hunter

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
now what is nice is that with the hunter

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
now what is nice is that with the hunter
seeker<00:01:27.870> missiles<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.560> flexibility

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
seeker missiles you have the flexibility

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.760 
seeker missiles you have the flexibility
or<00:01:29.610> should<00:01:29.730> I<00:01:29.790> say<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.720> Ravens<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.620> have

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
or should I say with the Ravens you have

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
or should I say with the Ravens you have
the<00:01:31.920> flexibility<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.580> throw<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.420> hunter

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the flexibility to throw some hunter

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.120 
the flexibility to throw some hunter
seeker<00:01:33.900> missiles<00:01:34.230> at<00:01:34.380> some<00:01:34.590> brood<00:01:34.800> Lords

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
seeker missiles at some brood Lords

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.040 
seeker missiles at some brood Lords
should<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.550> pop<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.660> in<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
should they pop up so in that

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.240 
should they pop up so in that
circumstance<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.650> don't<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.130> any

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
circumstance you don't have to do any

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.550 
circumstance you don't have to do any
sort<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> glue<00:01:38.700> brood<00:01:39.510> lords<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.290> spam<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
sort of glue brood lords and just spam a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.750 
sort of glue brood lords and just spam a
bunch<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:40.890> Vikings<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.370> something<00:01:41.580> like<00:01:41.700> that
