system<00:01:14.229> if<00:01:14.619> you're<00:01:14.859> familiar<00:01:15.009> with<00:01:15.219> the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
system if you're familiar with the

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.690 
system if you're familiar with the
system<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:15.969> rules<00:01:16.149> share<00:01:16.420> common<00:01:16.960> ideas

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
system the rules share common ideas

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.219 
system the rules share common ideas
however<00:01:18.700> each<00:01:18.939> game<00:01:19.210> does<00:01:19.450> have<00:01:19.479> its<00:01:19.810> own<00:01:19.929> rule

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
however each game does have its own rule

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.200 
however each game does have its own rule
so<00:01:20.499> you<00:01:20.560> do<00:01:20.770> have<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.100> read<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.880> rulebook<00:01:22.060> for

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
so you do have to read the rulebook for

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.559 
so you do have to read the rulebook for
each<00:01:22.479> game<00:01:22.749> in<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.140> series<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.939> believe

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
each game in the series and I believe

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.919 
each game in the series and I believe
this<00:01:25.719> is<00:01:25.840> game<00:01:26.049> number<00:01:26.229> 15<00:01:26.859> in<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.369> series

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
this is game number 15 in that series

these<00:02:58.950> guys<00:02:59.250> here<00:02:59.579> appeared<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.269> think<00:03:00.480> that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.530 
these guys originally start on the cover
of<00:03:02.780> Alexander<00:03:03.780> deluxe<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.299> kind<00:03:06.450> of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
of Alexander deluxe so it's just kind of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.410 
of Alexander deluxe so it's just kind of
fun<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:07.019> all<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.340> okay<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.819> each<00:03:09.239> player

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
fun to see all that okay so each player

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.089 
fun to see all that okay so each player
is<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.690> get<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.930> fold<00:03:10.260> out<00:03:10.470> charts

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
is going to get to fold out charts

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.809 
is going to get to fold out charts
there's<00:03:11.640> train<00:03:12.090> effects<00:03:12.420> here<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.609> you're

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
there's train effects here and you're

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.390 
there's train effects here and you're
going<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> get<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.150> pair<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.420> these<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.370> lot<00:03:17.370> of

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
going to get a pair of these so a lot of

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.059 
going to get a pair of these so a lot of
charts<00:03:17.849> in<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.120> one<00:03:18.389> I<00:03:18.630> think<00:03:19.230> more<00:03:19.680> than<00:03:19.709> I

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
charts in this one I think more than I

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.699 
charts in this one I think more than I
can<00:03:20.280> remember<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:22.049> fact<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.349> each<00:03:22.500> player

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
can remember the fact that each player

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.379 
can remember the fact that each player
is<00:03:22.829> getting<00:03:23.069> one<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> think<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.639> is<00:03:23.970> something

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
is getting one I think is is something

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.430 
is getting one I think is is something
that<00:03:24.450> might<00:03:24.630> be<00:03:24.780> new<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.109> been<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> while

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that might be new it's been a while

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.800 
that might be new it's been a while
since<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.739> pulled<00:03:25.980> out<00:03:26.069> guh<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.150> don't<00:03:27.419> think

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
since I pulled out guh but I don't think

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.930 
since I pulled out guh but I don't think
other<00:03:28.530> games<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:28.889> had<00:03:29.069> quite<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.489> many<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
other games have had quite as many and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420 
other games have had quite as many and
certainly<00:03:30.450> not<00:03:30.599> in<00:03:30.660> color<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:32.250> is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
certainly not in color like this this is

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.640 
certainly not in color like this this is
really<00:03:32.609> nice<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.349> your<00:03:34.380> route

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
really nice and this is your route

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.379 
really nice and this is your route
points<00:03:35.040> tracking<00:03:35.430> car<00:03:35.669> this<00:03:35.849> is<00:03:36.030> something

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
points tracking car this is something

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.640 
points tracking car this is something
fairly<00:03:36.660> new<00:03:38.000> really<00:03:39.000> only<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> newer<00:03:39.650> modules

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
fairly new really only the newer modules

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.699 
fairly new really only the newer modules
have<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.829> have<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> nice<00:03:41.780> display<00:03:42.780> card<00:03:43.500> like

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
have a have a nice display card like

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.490 
have a have a nice display card like
this<00:03:43.739> for<00:03:44.430> each<00:03:44.519> battle<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:46.079> there<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.470> go

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
this for each battle so there you go

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.800 
this for each battle so there you go
looks<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.160> there's<00:03:47.400> two<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.090> them<00:03:48.269> which<00:03:48.780> is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
looks like there's two of them which is

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.809 
looks like there's two of them which is
I<00:03:49.880> guess<00:03:50.880> yeah<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.109> don't<00:03:52.859> see<00:03:53.400> why<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.579> need

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
I guess yeah I don't see why you need

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.610 
I guess yeah I don't see why you need
two<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.060> those<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.840> got<00:03:55.049> two<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.349> them<00:03:55.440> how

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
two of those but you got two of them how

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.640 
two of those but you got two of them how
about<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.299> counters<00:03:57.299> here<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.959> what<00:03:58.319> we<00:03:58.349> want

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
about that counters here is what we want

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.480 
maps and as I said in the unconditional
surrender<00:05:46.320> video<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:46.710> don't<00:05:46.920> have<00:05:47.280> a<00:05:47.310> lot<00:05:47.460> of

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
surrender video I don't have a lot of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.430 
surrender video I don't have a lot of
room<00:05:47.760> here<00:05:47.790> today<00:05:48.060> I'm<00:05:48.810> shooting<00:05:49.110> this<00:05:49.260> video

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
room here today I'm shooting this video

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.350 
room here today I'm shooting this video
so<00:05:50.160> I'm<00:05:50.250> not<00:05:50.310> going<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.490> be<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.610> lon<00:05:50.790> fold<00:05:51.060> any<00:05:51.270> of

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
so I'm not going to be a lon fold any of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.490 
so I'm not going to be a lon fold any of
these<00:05:51.510> but<00:05:52.320> there's<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:53.900> there's<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:55.020> bunch<00:05:55.350> of

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
these but there's a there's a bunch of

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.810 
these but there's a there's a bunch of
map<00:05:55.650> sheets<00:05:55.920> in<00:05:56.070> here<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.400> believe<00:05:56.610> they're

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
map sheets in here and I believe they're

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.590 
map sheets in here and I believe they're
going<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.000> be<00:05:57.060> double<00:05:57.330> sided<00:05:57.600> yes<00:05:58.110> yes<00:05:59.040> siree

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
going to be double sided yes yes siree

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.760 
going to be double sided yes yes siree
so<00:06:00.600> there's<00:06:01.130> one<00:06:02.130> double<00:06:02.430> sided<00:06:02.640> map<00:06:03.770> to

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
so there's one double sided map to

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.100 
so there's one double sided map to
double<00:06:05.460> sided<00:06:05.640> maps<00:06:05.880> I'm<00:06:06.210> guessing<00:06:06.900> there's<00:06:07.050> a

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
double sided maps I'm guessing there's a

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.770 
double sided maps I'm guessing there's a
map<00:06:07.320> for<00:06:07.350> each<00:06:07.560> battle<00:06:08.150> I'm<00:06:09.150> not<00:06:09.300> sure<00:06:09.480> any<00:06:09.720> of

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
map for each battle I'm not sure any of

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.750 
map for each battle I'm not sure any of
these<00:06:09.900> were<00:06:10.110> fought<00:06:10.530> on<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:11.130> generika

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
these were fought on that generika

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.560 
these were fought on that generika
terrain<00:06:12.060> but<00:06:12.470> maybe<00:06:13.470> I'm<00:06:13.650> wrong<00:06:14.360> okay<00:06:15.360> so<00:06:15.450> you

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
terrain but maybe I'm wrong okay so you

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.420 
terrain but maybe I'm wrong okay so you
got<00:06:15.690> three<00:06:15.900> map<00:06:16.140> sheets<00:06:16.470> double<00:06:16.890> sided<00:06:17.130> and

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
got three map sheets double sided and

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.770 
got three map sheets double sided and
then<00:06:17.640> you<00:06:17.760> have<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.770> battle<00:06:19.770> book<00:06:19.920> here<00:06:20.780> just
