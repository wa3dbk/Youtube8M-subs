when teens I don't assume you mean
twelve<00:00:21.270> or<00:00:21.390> thirteen<00:00:21.779> I'm<00:00:21.990> assuming<00:00:22.439> you're

fifteen sixteen eighteen something like

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.349 
fifteen sixteen eighteen something like
that<00:00:25.099> before<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.460> finish<00:00:26.760> growing<00:00:27.000> because

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that before you finish growing because

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
that before you finish growing because
males<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:27.869> stop<00:00:28.230> growing<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.890> height

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
males do not stop growing and height

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.919 
males do not stop growing and height
until<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.789> 21<00:00:30.179> years<00:00:30.330> old

until they are 21 years old

until they are 21 years old
if<00:00:31.769> squatting<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:32.759> heavy<00:00:33.000> squatting<00:00:33.570> will

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
if squatting or heavy squatting will

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.590 
if squatting or heavy squatting will
reduce<00:00:35.579> their<00:00:35.790> height<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
reduce their height because this is a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
reduce their height because this is a
common<00:00:36.899> myth<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> reason<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> myth<00:00:38.040> has

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
common myth and the reason this myth has

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.940 
common myth and the reason this myth has
become<00:00:38.520> common<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.770> squats<00:00:40.770> are

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
become common is that squats are

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
become common is that squats are
actually<00:00:41.370> hard<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.850> take<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> work<00:00:42.570> so

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
actually hard they take a lot of work so

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.150 
actually hard they take a lot of work so
if<00:00:42.899> anyone<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.379> come<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:44.100> reason

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
if anyone can come up with a good reason

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.139 
if anyone can come up with a good reason
not<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.289> them<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:47.010> myth<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.399> perpetuate

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
not to do them that myth will perpetuate

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
not to do them that myth will perpetuate
very<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.840> quickly<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> very

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
very very quickly and this is a very

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.580 
very very quickly and this is a very
common<00:00:50.280> myth<00:00:50.489> apparently<00:00:51.000> these<00:00:51.180> days<00:00:51.590> but

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
common myth apparently these days but

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.229 
common myth apparently these days but
there's<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:52.980> no<00:00:53.370> truth<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> have

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
there's actually no truth to it and have

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.610 
there's actually no truth to it and have
even<00:00:54.480> heard<00:00:54.600> people<00:00:54.780> who<00:00:54.989> squad<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.469> many

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
even heard people who squad for many

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.779 
even heard people who squad for many
years<00:00:55.829> say<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.280> felt<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.579> their

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
years say that they felt that their

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.090 
years say that they felt that their
heavy<00:00:56.969> squats<00:00:57.500> reduced<00:00:58.500> their<00:00:58.680> height<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
heavy squats reduced their height and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
heavy squats reduced their height and
they<00:00:59.190> didn't<00:00:59.399> realize<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.390> they

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
they didn't realize it it's because they

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
they didn't realize it it's because they
aged<00:01:00.960> 25<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:01.949> 30<00:01:02.129> years<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.059> shorter

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
aged 25 or 30 years they got shorter

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.539 
aged 25 or 30 years they got shorter
most<00:01:03.750> men<00:01:04.140> lose<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> eight<00:01:05.010> inches<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
most men lose up to eight inches of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
most men lose up to eight inches of
height<00:01:06.260> primarily<00:01:07.260> due<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> bone

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
height primarily due to bone

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.780 
height primarily due to bone
demineralization<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.659> spine<00:01:10.549> it's<00:01:11.549> not

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
demineralization in your spine it's not

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
demineralization in your spine it's not
because<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> friction<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.200> wearing<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.770> down

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
because the friction is wearing it down

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820 
because the friction is wearing it down
we're<00:01:14.540> dynamic<00:01:15.540> organisms<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.229> rebuild<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
we're dynamic organisms we rebuild that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
we're dynamic organisms we rebuild that
stuff<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.700> general<00:01:18.180> bone

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
stuff all the time this is general bone

stuff all the time this is general bone
demineralization<00:01:19.250> now<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> truth<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:22.369> squats

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
demineralization now the truth is squats

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
demineralization now the truth is squats
and<00:01:23.549> deadlifts<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.030> both<00:01:24.210> load-bearing

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and deadlifts are both load-bearing

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
and deadlifts are both load-bearing
exercises<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.619> will<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.070> lot<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.700> stress

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
exercises that will put a lot of stress

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.080 
exercises that will put a lot of stress

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
are sufficient to allow it to do so so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.090 
are sufficient to allow it to do so so
in<00:01:53.490> reality<00:01:54.350> doing<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:55.500> load<00:01:55.770> bearing

in reality doing these load bearing
exercises<00:01:56.610> correctly<00:01:57.590> may<00:01:58.590> help<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.250> reach

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
exercises correctly may help you reach

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.030 
exercises correctly may help you reach
your<00:01:59.640> full<00:02:00.299> height<00:02:00.719> potential<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.770> are

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
your full height potential if you are

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.410 
your full height potential if you are
still<00:02:02.310> growing<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> they're<00:02:02.939> certainly<00:02:03.329> not

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
still growing and they're certainly not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
still growing and they're certainly not
going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> impede<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.500> no<00:02:04.649> reason<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
going to impede it there's no reason to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
going to impede it there's no reason to
think<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.909> anything<00:02:06.869> they

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
think that they will if anything they

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
think that they will if anything they
will<00:02:07.170> improve<00:02:07.710> bone<00:02:08.039> mineralization<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
will improve bone mineralization and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.339 
will improve bone mineralization and
strength<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.690> those<00:02:09.780> bones<00:02:10.080> are

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
strength and if those bones are

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.210 
strength and if those bones are
healthier<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> stronger

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
healthier and stronger

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.600 
healthier and stronger
they're<00:02:13.220> more<00:02:13.430> likely<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.850> growth<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:16.460> I'm

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
they're more likely to growth and I'm

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.160 
they're more likely to growth and I'm
not<00:02:16.760> saying<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.300> will<00:02:17.540> help<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.930> grow

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
not saying that it will help you grow

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.470 
not saying that it will help you grow
but<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.500> would<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:19.040> more<00:02:19.310> logical<00:02:19.610> argument

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
but it would be a more logical argument

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.050 
but it would be a more logical argument
to<00:02:21.290> say<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.830> would<00:02:21.980> probably<00:02:22.490> help<00:02:22.790> you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
to say that it would probably help you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.730 
to say that it would probably help you
reach<00:02:23.270> your<00:02:23.510> high<00:02:23.660> potential<00:02:24.260> rather<00:02:24.500> than

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
reach your high potential rather than

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.530 
reach your high potential rather than
hinder<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.160> if<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.730> had<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.880> pick<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
hinder it if you had to pick one or the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.730 
hinder it if you had to pick one or the
other<00:02:26.750> now<00:02:27.740> as<00:02:27.980> far<00:02:28.160> as<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.460> aging<00:02:29.120> goes<00:02:29.740> we

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
other now as far as the aging goes we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.950 
other now as far as the aging goes we
know<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.730> lifting<00:02:32.120> reduces<00:02:32.780> both

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
know that lifting reduces both

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960 
know that lifting reduces both
mineralization<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.800> improves<00:02:34.250> bone<00:02:34.520> density

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
mineralization and improves bone density

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
mineralization and improves bone density
it<00:02:35.090> improves<00:02:35.480> bone<00:02:35.930> health<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.810> get

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
it improves bone health so as you get

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.840 
it improves bone health so as you get
older<00:02:39.170> continuing<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.070> squat<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.520> deadlift

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
older continuing to squat and deadlift

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.270 
older continuing to squat and deadlift
may<00:02:41.270> help<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.900> keep<00:02:42.230> three<00:02:42.620> or<00:02:42.740> four<00:02:42.950> inches

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
may help you keep three or four inches

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.010 
may help you keep three or four inches
of<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.550> height<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.660> might<00:02:44.870> have

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
of the height that you might have

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.810 
of the height that you might have
otherwise<00:02:45.410> lost<00:02:45.740> because<00:02:46.160> instead<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.640> losing

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
otherwise lost because instead of losing

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.550 
otherwise lost because instead of losing
only<00:02:47.180> eight<00:02:47.420> inches<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.840> height<00:02:48.020> as<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.410> age

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
only eight inches of height as you age

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.530 
only eight inches of height as you age
you<00:02:48.770> might<00:02:48.950> only<00:02:49.190> lose<00:02:49.580> three<00:02:49.910> four<00:02:50.120> or<00:02:50.270> five

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
you might only lose three four or five

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.620 
you might only lose three four or five
as<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.440> result<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.100> better<00:02:52.400> bone<00:02:52.730> integrity<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
as a result of better bone integrity and

excuses<00:03:15.830> like<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.160> not<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.610> squat<00:03:16.880> when<00:03:17.000> they

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
excuses like this not to squat when they

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.120 
excuses like this not to squat when they
are<00:03:17.209> actually<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.690> opposite<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.980> truth

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
are actually the opposite of the truth
