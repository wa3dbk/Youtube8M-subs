00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.770 

the<00:00:01.050> vacuum<00:00:01.469> wasn't<00:00:01.829> working<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.510> was<00:00:03.510> told

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
the vacuum wasn't working I was told

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.240 
the vacuum wasn't working I was told
today<00:00:04.049> would<00:00:04.670> start<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.879> quit<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:07.189> try<00:00:08.189> to

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
today would start and quit and try to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.970 
today would start and quit and try to
start<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.550> game<00:00:08.670> then<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.030> would<00:00:09.120> quit<00:00:09.980> so

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
start a game then it would quit so

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.090 
start a game then it would quit so
anyway<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:13.160> ended<00:00:14.160> up<00:00:14.280> taking<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.730> apart<00:00:15.030> and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
anyway I ended up taking it apart and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.840 
anyway I ended up taking it apart and
determining<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:18.770> switch<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.160> doesn't

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
determining that the switch here doesn't

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.609 
determining that the switch here doesn't
have<00:00:20.939> continuity<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:26.750> I'm<00:00:27.750> thinking<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> doing

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
have continuity so I'm thinking of doing

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.860 
have continuity so I'm thinking of doing
this<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.330> do<00:00:30.330> dole<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.630> rivets<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:32.600> and<00:00:33.600> take

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this to do dole of rivets out and take

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.190 
this to do dole of rivets out and take
it<00:00:33.899> apart<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.500> what's<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> inside

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
it apart and see what's going on inside

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
it apart and see what's going on inside
there<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.790> ready<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> drill<00:00:46.789> there

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
there it is ready for the drill there

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.590 
there it is ready for the drill there
it's<00:00:47.969> apart<00:00:52.520> not<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:53.850> familiar<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.300> how

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
it's apart not really familiar with how

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's apart not really familiar with how
that<00:00:54.899> looks<00:00:55.559> softer<00:00:56.899> take<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.960> apart

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that looks softer take it apart

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.009 
that looks softer take it apart
carefully<00:00:58.379> look<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.340> closely

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.750 

well<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:05.129> piece<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:07.549> supposed<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> look

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
well that piece there supposed to look

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.230 
well that piece there supposed to look
like<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.180> piece<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:11.240> it's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
like that piece down there it's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.590 
like that piece down there it's
obviously<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> seen<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.330> forget

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
obviously that's so I seen you forget

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
obviously that's so I seen you forget
amount<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.020> metal<00:01:16.290> missing<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.299> not

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
amount of metal missing so it's just not

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
amount of metal missing so it's just not
complete<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> circuit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
complete the circuit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
complete the circuit
one<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.030> try<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
one little try to do now is to see if I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.480 
one little try to do now is to see if I
can<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.850> piece<00:01:24.650> into<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.159> other

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
can make that piece into what the other

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.840 
can make that piece into what the other
piece<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.600> before<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.880> worn<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:31.850> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
piece was before it was worn out it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
piece was before it was worn out it
could<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.329> quite<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.780> challenge<00:01:36.229> there

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
could be quite a little challenge there

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
could be quite a little challenge there
the<00:01:38.220> old<00:01:38.579> piece<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> new<00:01:39.479> piece<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.610> cage

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the old piece and the new piece the cage

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
the old piece and the new piece the cage
and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> new<00:01:42.270> pieces<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.750> quite<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.200> heavy<00:01:43.439> but

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and the new pieces of quite as heavy but

00:01:43.619 --> 00:02:03.599 
and the new pieces of quite as heavy but
it's<00:01:44.399> worth<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> try<00:01:44.970> oh<00:01:47.600> oh

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.210 

we'll<00:02:04.609> try<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.909> now
