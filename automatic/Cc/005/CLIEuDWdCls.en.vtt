00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.500 
freezing and I don't have a cameraman
today<00:00:06.750> but<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.770> figured<00:00:08.189> there's<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:09.179> move<00:00:09.360> I

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
today but I figured there's one move I

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.959 
today but I figured there's one move I
can<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.170> own<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.340> camera<00:00:11.730> which

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
can do on my own with the camera which

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.060 
can do on my own with the camera which
is<00:00:12.269> one<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.320> my<00:00:13.410> favorite<00:00:13.769> things<00:00:13.950> from

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
is one of my favorite things from

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.790 
is one of my favorite things from
wrestling<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:15.120> isn't<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> big<00:00:16.230> move<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
wrestling which isn't a big move but I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400 
wrestling which isn't a big move but I
think<00:00:17.039> it'll<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.250> cool<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.580> do<00:00:17.990> which<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
think it'll be cool to do which is the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.010 
think it'll be cool to do which is the
Ric<00:00:19.830> Flair<00:00:20.189> face<00:00:20.699> ball<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.539> know<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> he's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
Ric Flair face ball you know and he's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.150 
Ric Flair face ball you know and he's
getting<00:00:23.150> beat<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.619> usually<00:00:25.619> he'll<00:00:25.800> come

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
getting beat up and usually he'll come

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.589 
getting beat up and usually he'll come
out<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.490> corner<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.420> he's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
out of the corner and look like he's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.389 
out of the corner and look like he's
alright<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:28.880> falls<00:00:29.880> face<00:00:30.449> flat<00:00:31.399> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
alright and then falls face flat so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:01:26.039 
alright and then falls face flat so
let's<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.910> it

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.560 

this<00:01:27.049> is<00:01:27.229> not<00:01:27.440> as<00:01:27.650> easy<00:01:27.680> as<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.299> looks

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
this is not as easy as it looks

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.680 
this is not as easy as it looks
when<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.619> do<00:01:30.799> this<00:01:31.009> bump<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:32.180> want<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.450> land

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
when you do this bump you want to land

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.639 
when you do this bump you want to land
with<00:01:33.110> most<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.530> your<00:01:33.680> weight<00:01:33.950> right<00:01:34.640> here<00:01:35.649> the

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
with most of your weight right here the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.279 
with most of your weight right here the
shoulder<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:37.369> chest<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:38.720> put<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:39.140> your

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
shoulder and chest you put out your

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.840 
shoulder and chest you put out your
right<00:01:39.409> hand<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.830> slow<00:01:40.039> you<00:01:40.100> down<00:01:40.220> but<00:01:40.670> you

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
right hand to slow you down but you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.850 
right hand to slow you down but you
don't<00:01:40.880> want<00:01:41.149> to<00:01:41.240> put<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.539> out<00:01:41.659> too<00:01:41.990> earlier<00:01:42.500> or

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
don't want to put it out too earlier or

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.120 
don't want to put it out too earlier or
too<00:01:43.490> far<00:01:43.759> before<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:44.390> fall<00:01:44.890> because<00:01:45.890> of

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
too far before you fall because of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.010 
too far before you fall because of
course<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.789> want<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.030> break<00:01:47.240> your<00:01:47.390> fall<00:01:47.659> a

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
course you want to break your fall a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.010 
course you want to break your fall a
little<00:01:48.380> bit<00:01:48.560> with<00:01:48.979> your<00:01:49.159> right<00:01:49.340> hand<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:50.840> not

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
little bit with your right hand but not

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.080 
little bit with your right hand but not
so<00:01:51.259> much<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:51.800> ruins<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.220> face<00:01:52.429> bump<00:01:52.700> a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
so much that it ruins the face bump a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.050 
so much that it ruins the face bump a
lot<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.110> times<00:01:54.350> when<00:01:54.800> Ric<00:01:54.979> Flair<00:01:55.250> does<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:55.819> I

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
lot of times when Ric Flair does this I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.850 
lot of times when Ric Flair does this I
think<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:56.960> looks<00:01:57.110> cooler<00:01:57.350> when<00:01:57.500> he's<00:01:57.649> going

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
think it looks cooler when he's going

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:12.850 
think it looks cooler when he's going
backwards<00:02:10.930> and<00:02:11.930> then<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.230> kick<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.680> your

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
backwards and then you kick out your

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.190 
backwards and then you kick out your
left<00:02:13.069> leg<00:02:13.370> that'll<00:02:13.910> begin<00:02:14.030> your<00:02:14.330> fall<00:02:14.600> forward

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
left leg that'll begin your fall forward

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.699 
left leg that'll begin your fall forward
so<00:02:16.330> land<00:02:17.330> with<00:02:17.540> most<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.230> impact<00:02:18.530> right

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
so land with most of the impact right

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.580 
so land with most of the impact right
here<00:02:19.090> put<00:02:20.090> your<00:02:20.120> hand<00:02:20.510> your<00:02:20.930> right<00:02:21.110> hand<00:02:21.410> out

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
here put your hand your right hand out

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.460 
here put your hand your right hand out
to<00:02:22.430> slow<00:02:22.670> yourself<00:02:22.790> down<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.269> little<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.750> there

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
to slow yourself down a little bit there

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.739 
to slow yourself down a little bit there
you<00:02:24.560> go
