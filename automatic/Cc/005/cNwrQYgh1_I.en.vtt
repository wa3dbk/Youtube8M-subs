00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.940
 the main tools in the cloud 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.950
 in core they are also very intuitive and 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.720
 easy to use since it's nothing 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.550
 different from what you've seen in other 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.250
 vision programs both photography 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.830
 as video or in other programs 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.120
 also like for texts among others 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.910
 things 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.410
 the first tool is for the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.330
 selection tool how can you 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.370
 observe is the icon of an arrow and 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.500
 it is simply to select those 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 buttons and also be able to power them 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.580
 move them through the entire menu 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.310
 the direct selection tool 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.880
 it also selects what are texts 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.950
 or other objects that have or are in 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.620
 the main menu or any of the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.860
 menus you can also move all these 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.980
 buttons but it's different function to the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 the normal selection tool 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.870
 the Direct Selection Tool 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.060
 moves but only the text or 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 depending on where you take it for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 example you can rotate that text 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 however, note that the button does not rotate 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 only the text and that's the function 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 of the direct selection tool 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.440
 then two more tools come 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.080
 that we hardly use as is the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.479
 move tool and tool 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 rotation usually almost does not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 they use these two tools without 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.720
 However, the text tool 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.050
 obviously it is used a lot to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.800
 change the text to both the menu and those 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.600
 buttons that you can see here 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.399
 obviously to know what it is that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.070
 we are selecting in the text and not 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.030
 create a new one 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.640
 you have to move as you can see 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 in the icon that appears in the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.780
 selection tool 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.650
 change and those brackets are removed 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.110
 when you go directly to a text 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.270
 if you see how they change and if they remove their 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.130
 brackets when they have the brackets is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.640
 to create new text you simply give 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:14.000
 click and start creating new text without 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.000
 However, if you take that tool 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.640
 and the indifference where there is a text 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.189
 when those brackets are removed 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.170
 to select that text then what 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.920
 you can drag and select all the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.329
 text just like the buttons on the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.819
 text that appears right there in the 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.310
 buttons when the brackets are removed 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.140
 is that you are selecting directly 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.569
 this text is now also the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.299
 vertical text tool which does not 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.540
 is something other than to make text in 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.590
 vertical that simple 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.590
 and that's text you can manipulate or what 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.469
 you can turn on button also in ya 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.730
 we will see in other videos however the 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.799
 what follows is the tool 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.400
 magnify and that's to see the 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:05.859
 details within that menu that you have or 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.140
 any type of display or sampling that 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.680
 have here on your screen how can you 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.680
 observe there is to magnify that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.269
 list or you can manipulate it too 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.920
 from the tab that is 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.489
 directly below that screen 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.010
 where he says his and you can end what 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.900
 You mean adjusting to the screen 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.189
 what are you seeing here can you see it 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.799
 also web is smaller 50% 25 without 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.019
 However, so that it fits simply 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.060
 click on fit and adjust to the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.409
 As you have it, you can move it 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.620
 As you can see, you can move the 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.180
 windows and they fit that same insurance 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.560
 what are you seeing with the tool 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.599
 fit 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.959
 and well you can manipulate that menu 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.840
 also directly in photoshop like 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.690
 You can see here this menu of pressures to 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.410
 the next tool and it edits it 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.660
 in photoshop we are going to click and open 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.510
 photoshop and that way you can 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.250
 edit you can make changes by 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.590
 example, let's see 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.390
 the color of that text as you can see 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 is in blue you simply click on 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.150
 change color and you can do it by 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.630
 blue or other color example 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.940
 let's say that you want to choose we are going to 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.830
 put for example this green a little 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.260
 darker to highlight the menu 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.420
 you put it ok and those changes will be 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.100
 saved once you close this 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.580
 window in photoshop simply 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.009
 click on close 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.009
 First you click on mind control 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.910
 sorry to stop manipulating the text 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.010
 then you click here to close 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.080
 and says to save the changes obviously 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.010
 you are going to put that if to return to 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.380
 inform program and you can observe 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.510
 how that text has changed 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.240
 according to what we have edited in photoshop 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.400
 that simple and also the following 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.750
 tool is the preview of 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.260
 that video as you can see 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:12.010
 you just click there and it gives you 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.349
 would be the video already once finished him 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.460
 you can give in 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.680
 play 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.020
 or selection of scenes you can also 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.960
 make control from this icon forgive 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.449
 and there you can then start 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.550
 manipulate or see how those work 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.710
 buttons that you have created to exit 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.240
 you simply click on demand or 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.530
 out of here 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.729
 or close this window and so in that way 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.470
 tools work in a way 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.759
 too simple as you can see 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.900
 it's too intuitive and not complicated 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.900
 then those videos
