00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
here and there's one back there let's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:34.080 
here and there's one back there let's
just<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> look<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.210> guy

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.480 

and<00:01:34.390> extend<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.500> an<00:01:35.740> interesting<00:01:35.979> engine

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
and extend it's an interesting engine

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.039 
and extend it's an interesting engine
because<00:01:36.759> it's<00:01:36.939> showing<00:01:37.210> two<00:01:37.360> spark<00:01:37.659> plugs<00:01:37.869> per

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
because it's showing two spark plugs per

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.440 
because it's showing two spark plugs per
cylinder<00:01:38.079> but<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.740> also<00:01:38.860> has<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.130> dry<00:01:39.430> sump<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
cylinder but it also has a dry sump the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.670 
cylinder but it also has a dry sump the
two<00:01:43.630> spark<00:01:43.930> plugs<00:01:44.110> are<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.350> those<00:01:44.409> water

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
two spark plugs are in those water

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.730 
two spark plugs are in those water
jackets<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:46.600> probably<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.049> modified

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
jackets so it's probably a modified

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.359 
jackets so it's probably a modified
engine<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:49.539> serial<00:01:49.899> number<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.470> says<00:01:50.679> 107

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
engine the serial number on it says 107

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.399 
engine the serial number on it says 107
but<00:01:51.580> for<00:01:52.390> some<00:01:52.539> reason<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.929> number<00:01:53.170> stamp

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
but for some reason the number stamp

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.100 
but for some reason the number stamp
doesn't<00:01:53.770> look<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:53.920> good<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.780> let's<00:01:55.929> take<00:01:56.080> a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
doesn't look that good so let's take a

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.600 
doesn't look that good so let's take a
break<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.860> then<00:01:56.979> we'll<00:01:57.159> move<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
break here and then we'll move on to

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.929 
break here and then we'll move on to
part<00:01:57.909> two<00:01:58.119> here<00:01:58.450> at<00:01:58.570> ruckus
