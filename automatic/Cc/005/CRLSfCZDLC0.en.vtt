the<00:00:03.149> thing<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.720> think<00:00:04.049> being<00:00:04.230> open<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
the thing is is I think being open to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.099 
the thing is is I think being open to
critiques<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.609> really<00:00:06.150> studying<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.810> art<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
critiques and really studying the art of

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.520 
critiques and really studying the art of
animation<00:00:07.280> and<00:00:08.360> I<00:00:09.360> think<00:00:09.929> putting<00:00:10.139> yourself

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
animation and I think putting yourself

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.459 
animation and I think putting yourself
out<00:00:10.740> there<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.360> think<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.750> really<00:00:12.780> helped

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
out there I think it has really helped

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:23.570 
out there I think it has really helped
me<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:14.250> animator<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:15.030> Disney

are<00:00:27.419> human<00:00:27.750> style<00:00:27.900> characters<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.429> were

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
are human style characters and we were

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.630 
are human style characters and we were
going<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.000> subtlety<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.900> subtext<00:00:31.739> and<00:00:32.340> what

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
the characters were thinking and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.369 
the characters were thinking and
animating<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.780> character<00:00:37.230> was

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
animating what the character was

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.600

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
do how do I think that was good but I

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.729 
do how do I think that was good but I
think<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.640> think<00:04:19.970> that's<00:04:20.180> great<00:04:20.570> because<00:04:20.900> you

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
think I think that's great because you

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.020 
think I think that's great because you
know<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.859> look<00:04:22.130> back<00:04:22.340> at<00:04:22.520> some<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.820> shots

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
know I look back at some of the shots

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.300 
know I look back at some of the shots
that<00:04:23.180> had<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.390> made<00:04:23.600> in<00:04:23.780> previous<00:04:24.020> films<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.950> I

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
that had I made in previous films and I

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.430 
that had I made in previous films and I
don't<00:04:26.300> think<00:04:26.510> they're<00:04:26.660> as<00:04:26.780> strong<00:04:26.990> as<00:04:27.320> they

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
don't think they're as strong as they

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.409 
don't think they're as strong as they
could<00:04:27.710> be<00:04:27.919> but<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:28.700> think<00:04:28.730> that's<00:04:29.030> partying<00:04:29.360> a

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
could be but I think that's partying a

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.170 
could be but I think that's partying a
part<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.900> growth<00:04:30.110> processes<00:04:30.820> if<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:31.880> look

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
part of the growth processes if you look

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.300 
part of the growth processes if you look
back<00:04:32.360> at<00:04:32.570> your<00:04:32.660> student<00:04:33.080> work<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:34.040> think

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
back at your student work and you think

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.150 
back at your student work and you think
it<00:04:34.430> rocks<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:35.720> think<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.050> was<00:04:36.200> amazing

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
it rocks and you think it was amazing

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.950 
it rocks and you think it was amazing
I<00:04:37.190> think<00:04:37.940> somewhere<00:04:38.330> down<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.720> line<00:04:38.750> you

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
I think somewhere down the line you

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.219 
I think somewhere down the line you
stopped<00:04:39.410> learning<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.610> yeah<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.300> think<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:41.780> think

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
stopped learning so yeah I think I think

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.350 
stopped learning so yeah I think I think
the<00:04:42.290> majority<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:43.000> animators<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.270> are

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
the majority of animators that are

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.450 
the majority of animators that are
working<00:04:44.660> as<00:04:44.780> professionals<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.740> think<00:04:46.370> they

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
working as professionals I think they

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.790 
working as professionals I think they
look<00:04:46.640> back<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.150> their<00:04:47.870> student<00:04:48.260> reels<00:04:48.590> are

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
look back and their student reels are

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.170 
look back and their student reels are
kind<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.390> yeah<00:04:50.390> they're<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.930> weak<00:04:51.110> side<00:04:51.140> I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
kind of yeah they're on the weak side I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.090 
kind of yeah they're on the weak side I
think<00:04:53.180> having<00:04:53.540> other<00:04:54.020> animators<00:04:54.650> around

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
think having other animators around

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.580 
think having other animators around
studying<00:04:55.760> animation<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.630> think<00:04:57.380> they<00:04:57.470> help

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
studying animation I think they help

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.640 
studying animation I think they help
push<00:04:57.890> you<00:04:58.270> instead<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.690> know<00:04:59.810> I<00:05:00.080> always

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
push you instead of you know I always

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.969 
push you instead of you know I always

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
thought if I was somewhere in New York

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.750 
thought if I was somewhere in New York
because<00:05:03.979> none<00:05:04.100> of<00:05:04.130> my<00:05:04.310> buddies<00:05:04.610> were

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
because none of my buddies were

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.510 
because none of my buddies were
animators<00:05:05.300> or<00:05:05.570> wanted<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.410> study<00:05:06.710> animation<00:05:07.130> I

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
animators or wanted to study animation I

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.310 
animators or wanted to study animation I
always<00:05:08.150> pictured<00:05:08.570> if<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.840> was<00:05:08.990> somewhere<00:05:09.260> in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
always pictured if I was somewhere in

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.469 
always pictured if I was somewhere in
New<00:05:09.440> York<00:05:09.710> studying<00:05:10.100> animation<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.940> then

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
New York studying animation and then

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.810 
New York studying animation and then
coming<00:05:11.930> home<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.350> evenings<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.190> not

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
coming home in the evenings and not

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.600 
coming home in the evenings and not
talking<00:05:14.240> about<00:05:14.479> it<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.100> not<00:05:16.100> keeping<00:05:16.460> that

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
talking about it and not keeping that

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.150 
talking about it and not keeping that
thread<00:05:16.910> going<00:05:17.180> after<00:05:17.720> class<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.410> you<00:05:19.039> know
