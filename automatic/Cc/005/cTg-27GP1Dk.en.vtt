00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
set up for screen printing

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.849 
set up for screen printing
at<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.289> time<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.830> do<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
at this time we are just going to do a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.660 
at this time we are just going to do a
brief<00:00:32.250> summary<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.100> takes<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
brief summary of what what it takes to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.780 
brief summary of what what it takes to
get<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.090> basic<00:00:36.510> three<00:00:37.380> color<00:00:37.649> job<00:00:38.010> set<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.579> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
get a basic three color job set up and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.810 
get a basic three color job set up and
how<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.480> artwork<00:00:39.870> set<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
how to get your artwork set up for that

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.080 
how to get your artwork set up for that
so<00:00:41.820> let's<00:00:42.750> begin<00:00:42.930> by<00:00:43.140> looking<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:44.340> something

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
so let's begin by looking at something

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.619 
so let's begin by looking at something
that<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.510> call<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.020> color<00:00:46.289> composite<00:00:47.450> okay<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that we call a color composite okay this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.560 
that we call a color composite okay this
would<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.200> design<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:50.039> full<00:00:50.820> color<00:00:51.059> set

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
would be your design in full color set

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.990 
would be your design in full color set
up<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> finally

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
up the way that you want it to finally

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.810 
up the way that you want it to finally
appear<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.570> your<00:00:54.870> shirt<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> three

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
appear on your shirt so this is a three

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
appear on your shirt so this is a three
color<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> green<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
color you see you have the green you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
color you see you have the green you
have<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> grey<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:01:00.180> there's<00:01:00.449> also<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have the grey and then there's also a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.619 
have the grey and then there's also a
black<00:01:01.140> outline<00:01:01.699> okay<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> simple

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
black outline okay so this was a simple

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.630 
black outline okay so this was a simple
three<00:01:03.899> color<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.920> minimum<00:01:05.400> registration

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
three color with minimum registration

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.130 
three color with minimum registration
okay<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.970> important<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> note<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.869> time

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
okay it's important to note at this time

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
okay it's important to note at this time
that<00:01:10.460> screen<00:01:11.460> printing<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.229> limited<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.409> its

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that screen printing is limited in its

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.820 
that screen printing is limited in its
reproductive<00:01:14.250> capabilities<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
reproductive capabilities in that it is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.789 
reproductive capabilities in that it is
not<00:01:17.100> able<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.520> produce<00:01:17.759> continuous<00:01:18.659> tones<00:01:18.960> if

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
not able to produce continuous tones if

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.609 
not able to produce continuous tones if
you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.909> produce<00:01:21.119> continuous<00:01:21.960> tones<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you want to produce continuous tones you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.340 
you want to produce continuous tones you
will<00:01:22.650> need<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.540> create<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.840> called<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
will need to create what is called a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
will need to create what is called a
half<00:01:25.560> tone<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:27.509> grayscale<00:01:29.570> which<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> very

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
half tone or a grayscale which is very

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.340 
half tone or a grayscale which is very
similar<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.650> newsprint<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.060> ever

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
similar to newsprint if you if you ever

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.510 
similar to newsprint if you if you ever
notice<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.560> big<00:01:34.799> black<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.369> white

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
notice the big black and white

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
notice the big black and white
photographs<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> newspapers

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
photographs that they have in newspapers

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
photographs that they have in newspapers
how<00:01:37.590> they<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.979> dot<00:01:38.310> they're<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.619> made<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
how they have dot they're all made up of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
how they have dot they're all made up of
little<00:01:41.189> dots<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.780> screen

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
little dots and that's what screen

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.080 
little dots and that's what screen
that's<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.649> screen<00:01:43.950> printing<00:01:44.369> reproduces

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's how screen printing reproduces

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.080 
that's how screen printing reproduces
continuous<00:01:45.600> tones<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.079> through<00:01:46.290> dot<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.090> so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
continuous tones is through dot and so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.420 
continuous tones is through dot and so
there's<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.840> processes<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> there's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's two processes with that there's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.999 
there's two processes with that there's
the<00:01:50.729> four<00:01:50.939> color<00:01:51.210> process<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.020> halftone<00:01:52.950> II

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the four color process and halftone II

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090 
the four color process and halftone II
which<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.780> combined<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:55.079> spot<00:01:55.680> colors

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
which can be combined with spot colors

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.209 
which can be combined with spot colors
this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.790> called<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.450> spot<00:01:57.869> color<00:01:58.219> because

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
this is called a spot color because

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
this is called a spot color because
we're<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.610> simply<00:01:59.909> laying<00:02:00.119> down<00:02:00.479> spots<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
we're just simply laying down spots of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.760 
we're just simply laying down spots of
green<00:02:01.439> gray<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.490> black<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.439> were<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
green gray and black if we were to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.789 
green gray and black if we were to
combine<00:02:04.979> some<00:02:05.969> dot<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.689> halftone<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.590> this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
combine some dot or halftone with this

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.559 
combine some dot or halftone with this
we<00:02:08.520> would<00:02:08.670> call<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> spot<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.539> dot<00:02:10.340> okay

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
we would call it a spot and dot okay

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.739 
we would call it a spot and dot okay
and<00:02:11.680> basically<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.099> do<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.299> say<00:02:14.599> we

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
and basically what we do that for say we

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.530 
and basically what we do that for say we
wanted<00:02:15.109> the<00:02:15.230> green<00:02:15.439> to<00:02:15.769> be<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.549> green<00:02:16.969> here

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
wanted the green to be this green here

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300 
wanted the green to be this green here
but<00:02:17.870> then<00:02:18.019> we<00:02:18.170> also<00:02:18.319> wanted<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.859> green<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.189> be

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
but then we also wanted the green to be

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.000 
but then we also wanted the green to be
a<00:02:19.340> 50%<00:02:19.760> shade<00:02:20.689> of<00:02:20.870> what<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.139> is<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.859> could

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
a 50% shade of what it is we could

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.629 
a 50% shade of what it is we could
achieve<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.370> by<00:02:22.790> doing<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.269> 50%<00:02:23.989> grayscale

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:24.639 
achieve that by doing a 50% grayscale

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.940 
achieve that by doing a 50% grayscale
dot<00:02:25.639> and<00:02:26.019> having<00:02:27.019> one<00:02:27.499> color<00:02:28.400> one<00:02:29.150> screen

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
dot and having one color one screen

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.979 
dot and having one color one screen
actually<00:02:30.950> produce<00:02:31.519> two<00:02:32.030> different<00:02:32.480> tones<00:02:32.719> of

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
actually produce two different tones of

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.709 
actually produce two different tones of
the<00:02:33.049> same<00:02:33.379> color<00:02:33.879> okay<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.090> we'll<00:02:35.389> get<00:02:35.540> into

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:35.719 
the same color okay and we'll get into

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.899 
the same color okay and we'll get into
that<00:02:35.900> more<00:02:36.049> later<00:02:36.409> but<00:02:36.769> today<00:02:37.069> we're<00:02:37.700> going<00:02:37.790> to

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
that more later but today we're going to

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.449 
that more later but today we're going to
talk<00:02:38.090> about<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.450> separation<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.349> in<00:02:40.040> order<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
talk about the separation so in order to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.369 
talk about the separation so in order to
separate<00:02:40.939> your<00:02:41.090> artwork<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.169> pull

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
separate your artwork you have to pull

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.069 
separate your artwork you have to pull
out<00:02:42.530> each<00:02:42.739> each<00:02:43.069> printer<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.719> instance

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
out each each printer so for instance

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.220 
out each each printer so for instance
this<00:02:45.469> is<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.739> black<00:02:45.980> printer<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.840> what's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
this is the black printer this is what's

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.159 
this is the black printer this is what's
going<00:02:48.469> to<00:02:48.560> print<00:02:48.859> black<00:02:49.219> on<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:50.150> t-shirt<00:02:50.540> so

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
going to print black on the t-shirt so

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.409 
going to print black on the t-shirt so
as<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.439> can<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.650> we've<00:02:52.400> taken<00:02:52.699> what<00:02:53.239> we're

as you can see we've taken what we're
going<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.870> print<00:02:54.109> black<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.680> we've<00:02:54.859> pulled<00:02:55.129> it

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
going to print black and we've pulled it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.429 
going to print black and we've pulled it
out<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.669> the<00:02:55.849> composite<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.629> we've<00:02:57.019> left<00:02:57.290> it

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
out of the composite and we've left it

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.800

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
pulled out and this one has a little bit

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.089 
pulled out and this one has a little bit
of<00:03:20.090> registration<00:03:20.780> we<00:03:20.989> did<00:03:21.259> what<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.590> called<00:03:21.859> we

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
of registration we did what we called we

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.280 
of registration we did what we called we
knocked<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.639> out<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.509> that<00:03:23.659> the<00:03:23.750> inks<00:03:24.079> don't

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
knocked it out so that the inks don't

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.280 
knocked it out so that the inks don't
print<00:03:24.680> over<00:03:24.949> each<00:03:25.220> other<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.959> we'll<00:03:26.959> get<00:03:27.109> into

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
print over each other and we'll get into

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.860 
print over each other and we'll get into
more<00:03:27.439> detailed<00:03:28.419> explanation<00:03:29.419> of<00:03:29.509> artwork

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
more detailed explanation of artwork

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.649 
more detailed explanation of artwork
knocking<00:03:30.409> out<00:03:30.590> trapping<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:32.269> things

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
knocking out trapping and and things

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.360 
knocking out trapping and and things
like<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.259> the<00:03:33.319> future<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.919> is<00:03:33.979> a<00:03:34.129> very

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
like that in the future this is a very

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.460 
like that in the future this is a very
basic<00:03:34.989> introduction<00:03:35.989> as<00:03:36.349> I<00:03:36.470> said<00:03:36.709> okay<00:03:37.099> so

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
basic introduction as I said okay so

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.439 
basic introduction as I said okay so
there's<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.709> for<00:03:39.949> every<00:03:40.220> size<00:03:40.579> you're<00:03:41.299> going

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
there's that for every size you're going

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.629 
there's that for every size you're going
to<00:03:41.509> need<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:42.049> different<00:03:42.500> size<00:03:42.889> so<00:03:43.310> here's<00:03:43.579> a

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
to need a different size so here's a

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.580 
to need a different size so here's a
different<00:03:44.479> size<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.079> same<00:03:45.319> color

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
different size of the same color

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.869 
different size of the same color
composite<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.489> then<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.769> three<00:03:48.879> color

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
composite and then it's three color

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.719 
composite and then it's three color
separations<00:03:51.819> okay<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:54.049> as<00:03:54.319> you<00:03:54.739> can<00:03:54.889> see<00:03:54.949> for

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729 
separations okay so as you can see for

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.959 
separations okay so as you can see for
each<00:03:55.909> color<00:03:56.359> that<00:03:56.719> we<00:03:57.229> print<00:03:57.729> we're<00:03:58.729> going<00:03:58.909> to

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 
each color that we print we're going to

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.229 
each color that we print we're going to
need<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.359> separate<00:03:59.959> screen<00:04:00.579> so<00:04:01.579> one<00:04:01.879> screen

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
need a separate screen so one screen

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.839 
need a separate screen so one screen
will<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.659> this<00:04:02.959> artwork<00:04:03.409> on<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.979> the<00:04:04.430> second

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
will have this artwork on it the second

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.670 
will have this artwork on it the second
screen<00:04:05.120> will<00:04:05.359> have<00:04:05.479> this<00:04:05.689> artwork<00:04:06.139> on<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.560> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
screen will have this artwork on it and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.649 
screen will have this artwork on it and
the<00:04:07.040> third<00:04:07.280> screen<00:04:07.609> will<00:04:07.879> have<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.239> artwork

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
the third screen will have this artwork

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.679 
the third screen will have this artwork
on<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.139> each<00:04:09.590> printing<00:04:10.280> green<00:04:10.609> gray<00:04:11.479> and<00:04:11.959> black

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
on it each printing green gray and black

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.569 
on it each printing green gray and black
to<00:04:14.689> finally<00:04:15.199> give<00:04:15.409> us<00:04:15.590> this<00:04:15.829> image<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:16.430> the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
doesn't mean to say that you couldn't

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.060 
doesn't mean to say that you couldn't
that<00:05:49.950> you<00:05:50.070> couldn't<00:05:50.400> use<00:05:50.640> different<00:05:51.360> things

that you couldn't use different things

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.250 
that you couldn't use different things
okay<00:05:53.070> so<00:05:53.130> as<00:05:53.520> I<00:05:53.640> was<00:05:53.790> saying<00:05:54.080> that<00:05:55.080> doesn't

okay so as I was saying that doesn't
necessarily<00:05:55.560> mean<00:05:56.220> that<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.520> can't

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
necessarily mean that you can't

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.930 
necessarily mean that you can't
fabricate<00:05:57.150> some<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:57.900> your<00:05:58.080> own<00:05:58.230> equipment<00:05:58.740> and

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
fabricate some of your own equipment and

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.330 
fabricate some of your own equipment and
build<00:05:59.940> certain<00:06:00.330> things<00:06:00.750> that<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.350> need<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.860> do

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
build certain things that you need to do

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.900 
build certain things that you need to do
screen<00:06:02.580> printing<00:06:02.700> you<00:06:03.210> certainly<00:06:03.660> can<00:06:03.930> but

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
screen printing you certainly can but

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
what's important is to try not to make

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.550 
what's important is to try not to make
the<00:06:08.730> task<00:06:08.970> more<00:06:09.180> difficult<00:06:09.419> than<00:06:10.230> it<00:06:10.290> really

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
the task more difficult than it really

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.140 
the task more difficult than it really
is<00:06:11.690> okay<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.160> that's<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.400> for<00:06:14.610> today<00:06:14.880> that'll

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
is okay and that's it for today that'll

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.510 
is okay and that's it for today that'll
