00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
they have very nice green colors very

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.660 
they have very nice green colors very
vivid<00:00:48.010> you<00:00:48.879> know<00:00:48.969> yellow<00:00:49.300> flowers<00:00:50.670> smells

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
vivid you know yellow flowers smells

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.599 
vivid you know yellow flowers smells
very<00:00:51.999> good<00:00:52.179> and<00:00:55.589> one<00:00:56.589> thing<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:56.859> I<00:00:57.219> like<00:00:57.399> also

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
very good and one thing that I like also

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.540 
very good and one thing that I like also
they<00:00:57.999> also<00:00:58.210> but<00:00:58.690> very<00:00:59.170> easily<00:00:59.409> every<00:01:00.219> almost

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
they also but very easily every almost

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.029 
they also but very easily every almost
every<00:01:00.879> place<00:01:01.269> when<00:01:01.510> I<00:01:01.539> cut<00:01:01.839> it<00:01:01.989> they<00:01:02.649> will<00:01:02.800> grow

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
every place when I cut it they will grow

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.810 
every place when I cut it they will grow
new<00:01:03.069> shoots<00:01:03.339> so<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:06.310> what<00:01:06.490> I'm<00:01:06.700> gonna

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
new shoots so so this is what I'm gonna

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.270 
new shoots so so this is what I'm gonna
do<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.360> this<00:01:07.600> session<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:08.439> this<00:01:08.619> session<00:01:08.799> and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
do in this session in this session and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.120 
do in this session in this session and
do<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.640> very<00:01:09.969> heavy<00:01:10.450> pruning<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:11.439> this<00:01:11.649> report

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
do the very heavy pruning of this report

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.920 
do the very heavy pruning of this report
and<00:01:13.229> try<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.290> see<00:01:14.619> how<00:01:14.649> it<00:01:14.979> reacts<00:01:15.759> I've<00:01:16.570> worked

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
and try to see how it reacts I've worked

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.090 
and try to see how it reacts I've worked
with<00:01:17.049> this<00:01:17.170> plan<00:01:17.439> long<00:01:17.619> enough<00:01:17.829> to<00:01:17.950> know<00:01:18.070> that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
with this plan long enough to know that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.700 
with this plan long enough to know that
it<00:01:18.670> probably<00:01:18.880> will<00:01:19.210> will<00:01:19.960> tolerate<00:01:20.259> very

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
it probably will will tolerate very

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.209 
it probably will will tolerate very
heavy<00:01:21.100> pruning<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.780> survive<00:01:23.229> well<00:01:23.799> so

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
heavy pruning and and survive well so

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.889 
heavy pruning and and survive well so
this<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.490> my<00:01:25.000> plan<00:01:25.450> today<00:01:27.030> okay<00:01:28.030> before<00:01:28.479> we

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
this is my plan today okay before we

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is my plan today okay before we
proceed<00:01:29.229> let's<00:01:29.649> take<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.829> quick<00:01:30.070> look<00:01:30.219> at<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
proceed let's take a quick look at the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.959 
proceed let's take a quick look at the
possibilities<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.869> plan<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.500> see<00:01:32.969> you

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
possibilities of this plan I can see you

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.609 
possibilities of this plan I can see you
know<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.270> lot<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.229> nice<00:01:35.500> branches<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:38.170> will

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
know a lot of nice branches so I will

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.270 
know a lot of nice branches so I will
probably<00:01:38.859> create<00:01:39.430> some<00:01:39.640> kind<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.909> say<00:01:40.119> my

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
probably create some kind of say my

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.690 
probably create some kind of say my
informal<00:01:42.280> upright<00:01:43.859> somehow<00:01:45.240> trying<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:47.700> have

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
informal upright somehow trying to have

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.109 
informal upright somehow trying to have
a<00:01:48.729> taller<00:01:49.090> plant<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.280> looks<00:01:51.820> like<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.030> have

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
a taller plant and looks like I have

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.630 
a taller plant and looks like I have
some<00:01:52.149> nice<00:01:52.509> roots<00:01:52.899> here<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.320> show<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:53.979> I'll<00:01:54.429> try

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
some nice roots here to show so I'll try

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.139 
some nice roots here to show so I'll try
to<00:01:54.670> show<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.829> know<00:01:56.969> okay

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
to show that you know okay

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.870 
to show that you know okay
first<00:01:58.450> step<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.990> cut<00:01:59.200> all<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.560> low-hanging

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
first step is to cut all the low-hanging

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.389 
first step is to cut all the low-hanging
branches<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.170> know<00:02:02.380> for<00:02:02.859> sure<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.100> won't

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
branches that I know for sure I won't

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.990 
branches that I know for sure I won't
need

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.840 

and<00:02:08.000> also<00:02:08.150> to<00:02:08.510> expose<00:02:09.080> more<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.060> branches

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.190 

there's<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.940> lot<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.300> them<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.690> long<00:02:23.020> just<00:02:24.020> have

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
there's a lot of them so long just have

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200 
there's a lot of them so long just have
to<00:02:24.320> open<00:02:24.560> them<00:02:24.710> up<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:25.840> little<00:02:26.840> bit<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.400> let's<00:02:29.090> do

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
to open them up a little bit so let's do

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.970 
to open them up a little bit so let's do
the<00:02:29.330> same<00:02:29.450> thing<00:02:29.510> here<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.530> see<00:02:30.590> you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the same thing here and if you see you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.710 
the same thing here and if you see you
see<00:02:31.190> anything<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.670> pointing<00:02:32.240> downwards

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
see anything that is pointing downwards

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.240 
see anything that is pointing downwards
like<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.200> one<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.820> not<00:02:34.970> really<00:02:35.920> good<00:02:36.920> so

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
like this one it's not really good so

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.650 
like this one it's not really good so
you<00:02:37.310> cut<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.670> off<00:02:39.640> okay<00:02:40.640> just<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.030> quick<00:02:41.180> you

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
you cut it off okay just a quick you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.180 
you cut it off okay just a quick you
know<00:02:41.750> five-minute<00:02:42.320> trimming<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.980> look

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
know five-minute trimming to look

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.180 
know five-minute trimming to look
already<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.080> see<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.560> lower<00:02:45.740> branches

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
already you can see the lower branches

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.330 
already you can see the lower branches
more<00:02:46.430> clearly<00:02:46.790> now<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:50.980> mentioned<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.160> was<00:02:52.280> going

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
more clearly now I mentioned I was going

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.660 
more clearly now I mentioned I was going
to<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.610> very<00:02:52.880> heavy<00:02:53.240> pruning<00:02:53.510> industry<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.860> I

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
to a very heavy pruning industry so I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.830 
to a very heavy pruning industry so I
won't<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.510> too<00:02:56.720> much<00:02:56.870> about<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:59.330> top<00:02:59.570> I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
won't think too much about the top I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.630 
won't think too much about the top I
just<00:03:00.050> gonna<00:03:00.170> go<00:03:00.500> ahead<00:03:00.620> now<00:03:00.860> select<00:03:01.310> which

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
just gonna go ahead now select which

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.300 
just gonna go ahead now select which
major<00:03:01.880> branches<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.630> want<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.930> keep<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:04.160> can

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
major branches I want to keep you can

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.150 
major branches I want to keep you can
see<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.990> for<00:03:05.990> now<00:03:06.170> this<00:03:06.530> looks<00:03:06.770> like<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.920> good

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
see that for now this looks like a good

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.300 
see that for now this looks like a good
angle<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:08.030> know<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.010> trunk

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
angle you know this this is the trunk

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.880 
angle you know this this is the trunk
going<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.940> way<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:12.140> party<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.739> going

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
going this way and this party is going

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.910 
going this way and this party is going
to<00:03:12.980> be<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.160> first<00:03:13.340> side<00:03:14.030> branch<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.830> is

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
to be the first side branch and this is

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.440 
to be the first side branch and this is
gonna<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> main<00:03:16.489> branch<00:03:16.760> here<00:03:19.450> this

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
gonna be the main branch here this

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.540 
gonna be the main branch here this
branch<00:03:20.720> kind<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.080> bothers<00:03:21.440> me<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.920> might<00:03:22.370> cut

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
branch kind of bothers me I might cut

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.880 
branch kind of bothers me I might cut
there<00:03:22.730> off<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.930> if<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.350> turn<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.739> way

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
there off because if I turn it this way

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.780 
there off because if I turn it this way
you<00:03:25.250> see<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:26.470> actually<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.739> this<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.610> from

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
you see I actually have this is it from

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.630 
you see I actually have this is it from
the<00:03:28.910> major<00:03:29.090> trunk<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.750> have<00:03:30.200> one<00:03:30.470> branch<00:03:30.800> on<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
the major trunk I have one branch on the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.510 
the major trunk I have one branch on the
right<00:03:31.820> one<00:03:32.030> branch<00:03:32.300> on<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.570> left<00:03:33.310> it's<00:03:34.310> kind

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
right one branch on the left it's kind

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.990 
right one branch on the left it's kind
of<00:03:34.550> not<00:03:34.790> desirable<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:36.650> bonsai<00:03:37.100> terms<00:03:37.400> for

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
of not desirable in bonsai terms for

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.590 
of not desirable in bonsai terms for
this<00:03:38.150> style<00:03:38.330> at<00:03:38.600> least<00:03:39.610> I'm<00:03:40.610> gonna<00:03:40.850> keep<00:03:41.209> one

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
this style at least I'm gonna keep one

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.000 
this style at least I'm gonna keep one
of<00:03:41.750> them<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:43.280> I'm<00:03:43.370> gonna<00:03:43.550> remove<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.940> one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
of them so I'm gonna remove this one

00:03:45.010 --> 00:04:00.140 
of them so I'm gonna remove this one
keep<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.160> one<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.760> back<00:03:47.470> so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.550 

okay<00:04:01.150> after<00:04:01.270> I<00:04:01.420> cut<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.750> off<00:04:01.870> well<00:04:02.110> for<00:04:02.380> now

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
okay after I cut it off well for now

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.330 
okay after I cut it off well for now
make<00:04:02.770> sure<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.330> make<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> better<00:04:04.630> cotton<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:08.340> to

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
make sure I make a better cotton just to

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:18.180 
make sure I make a better cotton just to
the<00:04:09.430> trunk<00:04:15.989> should<00:04:16.989> have<00:04:17.109> used<00:04:17.350> my<00:04:17.500> clone<00:04:17.859> Cape

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
the trunk should have used my clone Cape

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.729 
the trunk should have used my clone Cape
Codder<00:04:18.549> so<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:18.970> brought<00:04:19.419> it<00:04:19.600> button<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.320> I'm

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
Codder so I brought it button and I'm

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:32.250 
Codder so I brought it button and I'm
gonna<00:04:20.919> cut<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.280> more<00:04:21.519> clean<00:04:21.850> now<00:04:27.240> okay<00:04:31.260> now

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
gonna cut it more clean now okay now

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.340 
gonna cut it more clean now okay now
which<00:04:32.500> other<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:34.180> this<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:34.930> gonna<00:04:35.050> be<00:04:35.229> the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
which other so this is gonna be the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.440 
which other so this is gonna be the
first<00:04:35.560> branch<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.260> one<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.560> going

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
first branch and this one is going

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.840 
first branch and this one is going
vertical<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.870> don't<00:04:41.080> want<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.760> I'm

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
vertical and I don't want that so I'm

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:50.490 
vertical and I don't want that so I'm
gonna<00:04:43.030> cut<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:46.410> yeah<00:04:49.110> it's<00:04:50.110> about<00:04:50.229> to<00:04:50.380> be<00:04:50.470> a

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
gonna cut it yeah it's about to be a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.200 
gonna cut it yeah it's about to be a
heavy<00:04:50.800> heavy<00:04:51.130> pruning<00:04:51.400> session<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:56.130> good<00:04:57.210> this

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
heavy heavy pruning session so good this

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.400 
heavy heavy pruning session so good this
is<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.390> first<00:04:58.660> branch<00:05:00.360> no<00:05:01.360> don't<00:05:01.900> try<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.110> see

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
is the first branch no don't try to see

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.610 
is the first branch no don't try to see
how<00:05:02.740> can<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.160> keep<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.669> tree<00:05:03.910> growing<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:07.620> can't

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
how can I keep the tree growing I can't

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.560 
how can I keep the tree growing I can't
really<00:05:08.770> follow<00:05:09.039> very<00:05:09.460> strict<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:10.120> formal

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
really follow very strict in formal

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.469 
really follow very strict in formal
upright<00:05:10.990> rules<00:05:11.260> for<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.100> plant<00:05:12.400> they<00:05:13.240> just

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
upright rules for this plant they just

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.570 
upright rules for this plant they just
grow<00:05:13.690> whenever<00:05:14.080> they<00:05:14.260> want<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.740> then<00:05:15.039> they

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
grow whenever they want and then they

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.750 
grow whenever they want and then they
constantly<00:05:15.940> have<00:05:16.979> in<00:05:17.979> my<00:05:18.100> experience<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.700> lot

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
constantly have in my experience a lot

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.650 
constantly have in my experience a lot
of<00:05:19.260> French<00:05:20.260> die<00:05:20.590> back<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.160> you<00:05:21.220> it<00:05:22.120> would<00:05:22.630> be

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
of French die back so you it would be

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.890 
of French die back so you it would be
pretty<00:05:23.200> tough<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.500> keep<00:05:23.919> this<00:05:24.130> plan<00:05:24.400> in<00:05:24.640> a

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
pretty tough to keep this plan in a

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.110 
pretty tough to keep this plan in a
definite<00:05:25.900> shape<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:27.160> will<00:05:27.610> always<00:05:27.850> be

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
definite shape it will always be

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.690 
definite shape it will always be
changing<00:05:28.539> so<00:05:28.750> be<00:05:28.930> prepared<00:05:29.470> for<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:33.270> okay

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
changing so be prepared for that okay

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.810 
changing so be prepared for that okay
more<00:05:36.700> fine<00:05:37.150> branches<00:05:37.750> that<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:37.990> don't<00:05:38.260> need<00:05:38.440> I

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
more fine branches that I don't need I

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.020 
more fine branches that I don't need I
cut

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.430 

okay<00:05:45.030> so<00:05:45.419> finally<00:05:47.240> this<00:05:48.240> is<00:05:48.449> gonna<00:05:48.630> be<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:49.020> new

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
okay so finally this is gonna be the new

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.600 
okay so finally this is gonna be the new
new<00:05:50.130> truck<00:05:50.690> skinny<00:05:51.690> I'm<00:05:52.020> tapering<00:05:52.410> off<00:05:52.620> it's

new truck skinny I'm tapering off it's

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.460 
new truck skinny I'm tapering off it's
gotten<00:05:53.940> it's<00:05:54.060> gotta<00:05:54.270> be<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.510> other<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:55.260> other

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
gotten it's gotta be the other the other

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:04.790 
gotten it's gotta be the other the other
branch<00:05:59.660> it's<00:06:00.660> kind<00:06:00.870> of<00:06:00.960> big<00:06:01.229> so<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:04.680> know

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
branch it's kind of big so you know

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.860 
branch it's kind of big so you know
anything<00:06:05.460> that's<00:06:05.699> growing<00:06:06.210> toward<00:06:06.720> the

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
anything that's growing toward the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.370 
anything that's growing toward the
inside<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.770> cut<00:06:08.190> it<00:06:08.310> off<00:06:11.000> just<00:06:12.000> to<00:06:12.270> try<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.260> make

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
inside I cut it off just to try to make

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.890 
inside I cut it off just to try to make
a<00:06:13.530> clear<00:06:13.889> division<00:06:14.340> of<00:06:15.270> what's<00:06:15.570> on<00:06:15.750> this

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
a clear division of what's on this

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.560 
a clear division of what's on this
branch<00:06:16.200> you<00:06:16.889> know<00:06:17.190> what's<00:06:17.400> on<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.639> main<00:06:17.910> trunk

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
branch you know what's on the main trunk

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.060 
branch you know what's on the main trunk
so<00:06:19.050> try<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.740> clean<00:06:20.070> up<00:06:20.100> this<00:06:20.400> area<00:06:21.860> that's<00:06:22.860> what

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
so try to clean up this area that's what

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:38.059 
so try to clean up this area that's what
I<00:06:23.100> would<00:06:23.370> do<00:06:31.010> maybe<00:06:32.010> even<00:06:32.340> just

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:45.089 

okay<00:06:39.069> so<00:06:39.929> main<00:06:40.929> trunk<00:06:43.319> first<00:06:44.319> sigh<00:06:44.589> branch<00:06:44.889> is

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
okay so main trunk first sigh branch is

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.589 
okay so main trunk first sigh branch is
a<00:06:45.129> big<00:06:45.779> another<00:06:46.779> second<00:06:47.229> major<00:06:47.379> sigh<00:06:47.679> branch

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
a big another second major sigh branch

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.929 
a big another second major sigh branch
and<00:06:49.599> this<00:06:50.169> is<00:06:50.319> a<00:06:50.349> branch<00:06:50.679> in<00:06:51.339> the<00:06:51.519> back<00:06:51.699> and

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
and this is a branch in the back and

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.999 
and this is a branch in the back and
that's<00:06:52.089> it<00:06:52.239> it's<00:06:52.749> very<00:06:53.019> simple<00:06:53.409> design<00:06:53.709> this

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
that's it it's very simple design this

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.569 
that's it it's very simple design this
is<00:06:54.659> this<00:06:55.659> is<00:06:55.869> where<00:06:56.199> I'm<00:06:56.289> gonna<00:06:56.439> stop<00:06:56.769> on<00:06:57.039> on

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:57.579 
is this is where I'm gonna stop on on

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:00.419 
is this is where I'm gonna stop on on
doing<00:06:58.329> the<00:06:58.479> major<00:06:58.689> branch<00:06:59.079> pruney<00:06:59.469> now<00:07:00.219> I'm

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:00.429 
doing the major branch pruney now I'm

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:02.369 
doing the major branch pruney now I'm
gonna<00:07:00.579> go<00:07:00.789> ahead<00:07:01.059> and<00:07:01.269> go<00:07:01.389> to<00:07:01.419> each<00:07:01.719> branch<00:07:01.989> and

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:02.379 
gonna go ahead and go to each branch and

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:09.509 
gonna go ahead and go to each branch and
do<00:07:02.999> pruning<00:07:04.169> to<00:07:05.169> reduce<00:07:05.529> the<00:07:05.709> length<00:07:08.369> so<00:07:09.369> my

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:09.519 
do pruning to reduce the length so my

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:15.379 
do pruning to reduce the length so my
idea<00:07:09.759> to<00:07:09.939> do<00:07:10.059> heavy<00:07:10.299> pruning<00:07:10.659> here<00:07:11.079> is<00:07:11.259> to<00:07:12.629> see

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389 
idea to do heavy pruning here is to see

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.989 
idea to do heavy pruning here is to see
all<00:07:16.389> the<00:07:16.749> new<00:07:16.899> shoots<00:07:17.199> coming<00:07:17.439> out<00:07:17.619> and<00:07:18.399> it's

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:18.999 
all the new shoots coming out and it's

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:25.350 
all the new shoots coming out and it's
gonna<00:07:19.149> fill<00:07:19.449> up<00:07:19.629> the<00:07:20.669> tree<00:07:21.669> you<00:07:22.269> know<00:07:22.439> so<00:07:24.360> you

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
gonna fill up the tree you know so you

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.009 
gonna fill up the tree you know so you
can<00:07:25.479> just<00:07:25.659> do<00:07:28.439> in<00:07:29.439> this<00:07:29.619> case<00:07:31.019> unfortunately

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:32.019 
can just do in this case unfortunately

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:33.989 
can just do in this case unfortunately
all<00:07:32.439> the<00:07:32.619> flowers<00:07:33.009> would<00:07:33.189> be<00:07:33.279> cut<00:07:33.459> off<00:07:33.489> by<00:07:33.939> this

00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:33.999 
all the flowers would be cut off by this

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:37.350 
all the flowers would be cut off by this
okay<00:07:34.979> and<00:07:35.979> reduce<00:07:36.309> the<00:07:36.489> lengths<00:07:36.909> of<00:07:36.999> all<00:07:37.209> these

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 
okay and reduce the lengths of all these

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.709 
okay and reduce the lengths of all these
minor<00:07:37.689> branches<00:07:38.369> and<00:07:39.369> wait<00:07:40.269> for<00:07:40.449> the<00:07:40.509> new

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:40.719 
minor branches and wait for the new

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:54.040 
minor branches and wait for the new
shoots<00:07:41.019> to<00:07:41.319> come<00:07:41.499> out

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.050
