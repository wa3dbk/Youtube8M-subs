00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.440
 and then the old man comes out and says 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.900

 Well then good story and their 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.740
 story was something i got an idea 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.420
 for the finale 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.460
 shepard and decides to get engaged to 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.739
 polite putting on a modern family 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.900
 and adopting five black children but 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.569
 shepard turns out to be an asshole and 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.159
 leaves home foresight from which 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.810
 and all those fucking little boys while 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.430
 meanwhile he goes around to save 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.349
 the galaxy all day 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.180
 polite remained then alone begins 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.519
 a love story with the TV guy 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.579
 by cable but here is one day 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.459
 shepard comes home from work and finds 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.260
 her husband in bed with another man is 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.750
 so angry that he loses control e 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 kills the guy on cable TV but not 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.900
 he realizes that the children are 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.969
 watching 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.549
 and then he drags shepard into 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.379
 court and is very angry and is a 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.139
 that point shepard realizes 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.090
 of his mistake and would like to keep with him 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.709
 the children so shepard and promises 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 be careful to spend more time with the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.909
 family and this moves the judge 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.730
 who decides to leave it free and so 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.709
 shepard de cortez and their five children 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.750
 adopted blacks will live forever 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:14.650
 joyful and happy 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:17.860
 it's wonderful, beautiful ending 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.409
 my final then shepard defeated i 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.269
 raiders and his next challenge e 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.959
 organize a party for his friends and 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.500
 not what color to choose for soda 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.099
 of the party if he chooses the color 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.230
 wrong garrus could die or maybe 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.379
 such because you cannot drink liquids and then 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:45.400
 all portals explode and krogan 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:47.849
 general shepard has been assisted 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.849
 you know 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.810
 however in my opinion it should end like this 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.120
 then there are kind of things more 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.250
 important are already happened there 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.079
 all the really cool explosions blaster 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.200
 and then there is shepard that when in base does 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.450
 or look at an email and there is a pre 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.760
 Cerberus message concerns his 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.459
 robot body and then check them out 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.030
