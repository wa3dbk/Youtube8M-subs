00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.480
 Welcome 7 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 I was a producer of the previous parter guitar part part 17 total 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.079
 It is Kim who finishes it 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:16.129
 The clip-on yen is in the 117 yen range and is 31 people small power vs. 462.5 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.679
 Be pampered 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.289
 Unreasonable teaching at university 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.949
 It is activity in the snow again with each service being esata2 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.210
 The disabled person who is in a series of war 2 incidents before this mistake 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.900
 With regard to expectations in terms of being ready to work 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.190
 It is said that it is done 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650
 I have a good figure 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.540
 I would like to carry it as an eight, I warned the other day 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 The prefecture has become this cut 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.490
 And that night is also normal 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.929
 It was not enough 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.740
 I've got that set 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.240
 And musician Ana 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.440
 Proud to Tochigi 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.920
 That's the prime minister 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.200
 It became unity that there was expression power 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.880
 It's fun is not it 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.899
 This is the first time I've been there 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.430
 It is Miyawaki 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.460
 That's right that Hirokazu 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.890
 It's like this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.450
 After a certain period, did you combine professionally? 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.950
 Well that's the name of the touch place kicker 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.000
 Obviously that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.230
 The other one 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.310
 I'm going to turn that way 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.950
 I liked my first sumo wrestling 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.840
 Well then, it was set at 8 o'clock, and redhat and novell were in town. 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.750
 Then we were 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 That's right first of all is half 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.490
 Work with content 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.030
 The stone garden has been doing for a long time 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 A proposal for you 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 free 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.680
 That's what it looks like 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.689
 In fact 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.719
 This paper knife is stabbed and the conflict is solved with the guitar 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.689
 It means that you 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.689
 I was allowed to 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.299
 Though editorial 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.039
 Fourth domestic case 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.899
 I love my music but still 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.019
 Though it is bright in the heart of music that you understand without 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.459
 Nakanishi Taka 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.069
 Because specialists have been 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 it is complete 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.689
 Resurrection of Hmm Taniya 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.419
 Although the actor has also kept the same from the main story mechanism in seven years 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.609
 Well here it is 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.789
 Sap in this slightly unusual flight 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.869
 So far the drop-guitars were lined up 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.479
 Please watch 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.489
 I walk along the road, but I take a walk along the road 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.579
 It looks like a catalist or a battery at all in Tokyo 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.219
 If you are 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.929
 At that point in time the intention of the court 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.769
 Today's name is a little different today too 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.269
 Same as active duty age 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.960
 There is no FLET'S after 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.889
 Because it is this same position, such a little bit 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.889
 My husband is different, he said 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.549
 If you ask about Fred Race 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.299
 Open the original song of Kim's stack 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.659
 I want to receive 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.290
 Atmosphere given by the tribute well before the punk band regular meeting 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.810
