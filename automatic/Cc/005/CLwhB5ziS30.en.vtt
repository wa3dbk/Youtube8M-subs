00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.289 

that's<00:01:35.100> why<00:01:35.280> these<00:01:35.340> kneeling<00:01:35.850> pads<00:01:36.090> were

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that's why these kneeling pads were

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.810 
that's why these kneeling pads were
great<00:01:36.540> especially<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.380> flat<00:01:37.650> sets<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
