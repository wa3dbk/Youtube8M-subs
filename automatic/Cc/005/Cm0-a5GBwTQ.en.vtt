00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.900
 hi everyone what if jake state other 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.540
 day more playing super mario 3d land in 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:15.190
 the world in the world 12 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:19.090
 this one seems to have this game ever and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:23.260
 I think he's seen little things in the game 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.390
 at least and this phase there are new bugs and 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.320
 and it seems that I'm not interested 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.469
 I think I 'm going to leave the flowers and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.789
 bugs this spear if they throw ink that what 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.269
 unique that makes the screen annoy 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.100
 but good here or nothing we will take the 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.999
 currency headquarters here back hey down there 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.999
 there something 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:54.360
 on this side over here let's see what it is 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.300
 what brings me up here is something 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 also investigate a lot in this game 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.340
 has a lot of super secrets 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.560
 family 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.950
 time has a lot of secrets in 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.230
 reality game this seems like no but 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.990
 It has a lot of things 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.630
 And what's worse is that I 'm not very 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.840
 Well I'm not very good at finding 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.370
 secrets really so I think it's going to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.920
 be a little fun allows perm 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.270
 try to find it or almost 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.760
 I will try to find the things that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.140
 game but hey I did not know 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.650
 well it does not matter here you will see other 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.180
 flowers for me see no to right there is that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.780
 see the many buttons I can not with 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.780
 so many buttons 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 and up here 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.420
 is that I am very bad the exercises that 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.760
 you can easily load it without 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.770
 problems jumping with the tano removing 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.690
 But, well, I'll make them like the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.540
 first phases I do not think the general 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.880
 faso do to the bases 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.570
 this dial jump 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.340
 it is assumed that the first phases do not think 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.340
 that are going to cost a lot of work and that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.310
 and why because simply 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.849
 a block and in short balear finally I have 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.079
 one thing to install the graphics is missing 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.700
 the first presents are easy 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.060
 we try and I say it is me who is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 playing so 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.370
 Besides, that dream says a lot 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.410
 commenting at the same time you play is not easy 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.480
 and let's go play this guy where you have 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.450
 to be careful not to eat the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.280
 giant balls wait there is a bug 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.019
 it could be late is here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.130
 you can also plants the palm tree 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.130
 meat screen but good 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.060
 they are super useful is good is true new 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.880
 reality that we lack life for 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.430
 later but good and consider the three 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.380
 perfect coins let's see what happens 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.180
 is that I have the problem this is high 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.180
 it's easier if you have him 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.280
 if you have the tanooki get the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.410
 get it 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.730
 the golden flag is much easier 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.920
 but hey I've got now also 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.240
 that is in a life every time you arrive 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.190
 at the top of the flag this is the 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.900
 of the golden flag that I could not reach 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.569
 to show it in the previous episode well 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.170
 that shows it now 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.739
 and episode today world episode flown 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.739
 finished 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.030
 I'll teach 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.850
 the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.920
 the boxes these are not phases as such 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.840
 so let's go into this world 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.450
 I think they are not phases as such and 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.950
 even if they were to find a box 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.130
 mysterious that it was a phase as such 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 If it is so short, you prefer to do it in the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.890
 same episode I made a world so 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.300
 does everything that might be the time 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.020
 Maybe it is seems coin mood and 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.080
 for all 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.840
 then all these pinchos 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.319
 coins appear 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.700
 but like this is the easy one right now and 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.830
 only for 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:10.690
 only two villas appear 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.690
 they kill things and that please 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.669
 let's say then we have made the world 12 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.160
 and the world 1 mysterious box is fine 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.479
 we are going at a good pace 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.130
 phase by episode like I said finally what 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.389
 I'm going to leave people here this many 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.470
 thank you problems and see you next 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.470
 episode bye
