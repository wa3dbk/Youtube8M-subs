that<00:01:56.430> way<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.119> obviously<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that way you know it's obviously a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.050 
that way you know it's obviously a
little<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:57.960> longer<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.860> way<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.100> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
little bit longer going that way but you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
little bit longer going that way but you
know<00:02:00.149> things<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.020> could<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
know things like that I think could be a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370 
know things like that I think could be a
lot<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> fun<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.689> still<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> work<00:02:04.229> in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
lot of fun this is still a work in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
lot of fun this is still a work in
progress<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.540> learned

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
progress and you know we kind of learned

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350 
progress and you know we kind of learned
a<00:02:06.990> lot<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.530> last<00:02:07.740> time<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.220> played<00:02:08.360> but

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
a lot from the last time we played but

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540 
a lot from the last time we played but
you<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:10.170> obviously<00:02:10.890> still<00:02:11.250> more<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
you know there's obviously still more to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.940 
you know there's obviously still more to
learn<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:13.470> not<00:02:13.620> even

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
learn with it but I'm not even

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.740 
learn with it but I'm not even
this<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.370> ready<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.819> played<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.300> yet<00:02:15.540> but

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this is ready to be played on yet but

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.479 
this is ready to be played on yet but
regardless<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.440> think<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.920> could<00:02:17.129> be<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> lot

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
regardless I think this could be a lot

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.430 
regardless I think this could be a lot
of<00:02:17.550> fun<00:02:17.849> for<00:02:18.569> those<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.930> unaware<00:02:19.110> of

you're<00:03:29.639> surrounded<00:03:30.299> there<00:03:30.540> if<00:03:30.720> they<00:03:30.930> managed

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
you're surrounded there if they managed

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.580 
you're surrounded there if they managed
to<00:03:31.470> isolate<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.400> or<00:03:32.639> if<00:03:32.760> they<00:03:32.910> managed<00:03:33.299> to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
to isolate you or if they managed to

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.470

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
the punch mechanism where you can charge

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.309 
the punch mechanism where you can charge
and<00:03:38.400> punch<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:39.750> were<00:03:39.870> having<00:03:39.989> guys

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319

going flying off buildings and stuff

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.080 
going flying off buildings and stuff
like<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:43.190> one<00:03:44.190> thing<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.549> we<00:03:44.639> did<00:03:44.880> really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
like that one thing that we did really

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.150 
like that one thing that we did really
pick<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.480> from<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> test<00:03:46.200> runs<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.799> play

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
pick up from the test runs of the play

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.390 
pick up from the test runs of the play
in<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.310> game<00:03:47.549> was<00:03:48.299> trying<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.500> favor<00:03:49.799> more<00:03:50.190> of

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
in the game was trying to favor more of

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.620 
in the game was trying to favor more of
a<00:03:51.470> active<00:03:52.470> game<00:03:52.769> were<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.760> would<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.389> weren't

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
a active game were you would you weren't

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.890 
a active game were you would you weren't
trying<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.819> run<00:03:56.819> away<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.090> hide<00:03:57.299> from<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
trying to run away and hide from the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.509 
trying to run away and hide from the
zombies<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.650> know<00:03:58.739> you're<00:03:58.889> having<00:03:59.040> people

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
zombies you know you're having people

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.370 
zombies you know you're having people
dig<00:03:59.760> really<00:04:00.000> deep<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.599> dig<00:04:00.870> these<00:04:01.019> elaborate

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
dig really deep and dig these elaborate

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.660 
dig really deep and dig these elaborate
tunnels<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:01.950> everything<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.400> felt<00:04:02.609> that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
tunnels and everything and I felt that

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.250 
tunnels and everything and I felt that
kind<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.180> went<00:04:03.450> away<00:04:03.540> from<00:04:03.930> what<00:04:04.079> we<00:04:04.170> were

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
kind of went away from what we were

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.789 
kind of went away from what we were
looking<00:04:04.620> for<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.970> think<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.989> lot<00:04:07.260> more<00:04:07.290> fun

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
looking for I think it's a lot more fun

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.259 
looking for I think it's a lot more fun
to<00:04:09.230> try<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.410> fight<00:04:10.799> off<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.250> zombies<00:04:11.700> you

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
to try and fight off the zombies you

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.270 
to try and fight off the zombies you
know<00:04:12.389> so<00:04:12.599> in<00:04:13.079> some<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.530> later<00:04:13.709> games<00:04:14.040> we

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
know so in some of the later games we

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.099 
know so in some of the later games we
were<00:04:14.400> trying<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.730> really<00:04:15.000> fortify<00:04:15.630> against

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
were trying to really fortify against

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.990 
were trying to really fortify against
the<00:04:16.229> zombies<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.889> had<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.579> know<00:04:17.669> tower

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the zombies we had this you know tower

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.390 
the zombies we had this you know tower
that<00:04:18.269> we<00:04:18.389> lit<00:04:18.599> on<00:04:18.630> fire<00:04:19.010> didn't<00:04:20.010> work<00:04:20.190> out

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
that we lit on fire didn't work out

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.810 
that we lit on fire didn't work out
great<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.209> know<00:04:21.239> things<00:04:21.570> like<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:22.820> but

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
great but you know things like that but

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.210 
great but you know things like that but
you<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.210> think<00:04:24.539> all<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.930> together

you know I think all of that together

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.780 
you know I think all of that together
really<00:04:26.220> helps

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
really helps

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.740
