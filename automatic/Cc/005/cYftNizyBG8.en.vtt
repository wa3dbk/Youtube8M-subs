00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
how's it going guys I am Matthias and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.960 
how's it going guys I am Matthias and
today<00:00:06.629> we're<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> be<00:00:07.049> unboxing

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
today we're going to be unboxing

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.490 
today we're going to be unboxing
something<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.090> little<00:00:09.240> unusual<00:00:09.389> it's<00:00:10.200> actually

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
something a little unusual it's actually

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.169 
something a little unusual it's actually
what's<00:00:10.889> not<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.250> unusual<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
what's not that unusual but it is a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.189 
what's not that unusual but it is a
nightlight<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.190> color-changing

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
nightlight but it is a color-changing

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.250 
nightlight but it is a color-changing
nightlight<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.440> here's<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:18.150> bigger<00:00:18.840> gimmick

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
nightlight but here's the bigger gimmick

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.189 
nightlight but here's the bigger gimmick
is<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> changes<00:00:20.039> colors<00:00:20.520> based<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is that it changes colors based on the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.710 
is that it changes colors based on the
temperature<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> guess<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> used<00:00:24.330> for

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
temperature so I guess this is used for

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.420 
temperature so I guess this is used for
people<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.470> kids<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.160> really

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
people that have kids and they really

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
people that have kids and they really
conscious<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:27.539> conscious<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
conscious want to be conscious about the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
conscious want to be conscious about the
temperature<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> room<00:00:29.369> maybe<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
temperature of the room maybe if you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.209 
temperature of the room maybe if you
have<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.539> place<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.800> did<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.160> last

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
have a place like we did in our last

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.740 
have a place like we did in our last
place<00:00:32.610> where<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.880> had<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> an<00:00:33.450> air

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
place where we had have an air

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660 
place where we had have an air
conditioner<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.380> every<00:00:35.040> separate<00:00:35.460> room

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
conditioner in every separate room

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.160 
conditioner in every separate room
because<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.090> didn't<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.360> central<00:00:36.719> air<00:00:36.930> um

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
because we didn't have central air um

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
because we didn't have central air um
this<00:00:37.860> could<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.190> good<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.570> could

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
this could be good for that this could

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
this could be good for that this could
be<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> good<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> quickly<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
be a good way to quickly see the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
be a good way to quickly see the
temperature<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> room<00:00:43.079> without<00:00:43.460> waking

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460

does say right here that blue is under
57<00:01:02.100> degrees<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.760> green<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.719> 59<00:01:04.199> 268<00:01:04.970> orange

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
57 degrees it's green from 59 268 orange

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
57 degrees it's green from 59 268 orange
from<00:01:06.240> 69<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.350> 78<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.750> read<00:01:09.750> above<00:01:10.200> 80<00:01:10.409> degrees

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
from 69 to 78 and read above 80 degrees

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
from 69 to 78 and read above 80 degrees
so<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.900> of

I feel like those are really big those
are<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.210> big<00:01:24.390> gaps<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.320> temperature<00:01:25.770> like

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
are really big gaps in temperature like

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.620 
are really big gaps in temperature like
Mutt<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.900> house<00:01:28.490> anywhere<00:01:29.490> between<00:01:29.850> 70

Mutt me at my house anywhere between 70

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
Mutt me at my house anywhere between 70

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and 75 is a huge change like around like

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.630 
and 75 is a huge change like around like
68<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.290> begins<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.159> cold<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.549> at

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
68 it begins to get really cold and at

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
68 it begins to get really cold and at
around<00:01:35.820> 75<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.659> begins<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.500> warm

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
around 75 it begins to be really warm

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.399 
around 75 it begins to be really warm
for<00:01:38.009> me<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.420> preferred<00:01:39.900> temperature

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
for me so like my preferred temperature

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.149 
for me so like my preferred temperature
is<00:01:40.619> around<00:01:41.150> 72<00:01:42.150> 73<00:01:42.570> degrees<00:01:42.990> Amanda's<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.619> 74

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
is around 72 73 degrees Amanda's like 74

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
they have two kids as you guys very well

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.569 
they have two kids as you guys very well
no<00:01:54.720> um<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.619> two<00:01:55.740> kids<00:01:56.009> Ariana<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639 
no um they have two kids Ariana and
Isabella<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.200> maybe<00:01:58.469> they

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Isabella so I don't know maybe they

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
Isabella so I don't know maybe they
could<00:01:58.799> use<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.640> their<00:01:59.909> lifestyle

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
could use this in in their lifestyle

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
could use this in in their lifestyle
quickly<00:02:01.259> check<00:02:01.469> temperatures<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.189> stuff

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
quickly check temperatures and stuff

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.280 
quickly check temperatures and stuff
like<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.630> point<00:02:03.719> those

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
like that because at this point those

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
like that because at this point those
girls<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.770> speak<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.280> maybe<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.640> can

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
girls can speak so maybe they can

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.300 
girls can speak so maybe they can
probably<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.210> mommy<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.659> cold<00:02:07.310> although

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
probably be like mommy I'm cold although

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.979 
probably be like mommy I'm cold although
they<00:02:08.640> might<00:02:08.789> not<00:02:09.000> always<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> first

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
they might not always do that first

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.900 
they might not always do that first
thing<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:11.180> adapter<00:02:12.180> here

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
thing I see is this little adapter here

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.090 
thing I see is this little adapter here
USB<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.630> that's<00:02:13.810> cool<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> use<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
USB so that's cool it's going to use a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.170 
USB so that's cool it's going to use a
micro<00:02:15.670> USB<00:02:17.070> there's<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.190> USB<00:02:18.610> cable<00:02:18.640> and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
micro USB there's the USB cable and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.510 
micro USB there's the USB cable and
here's<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.140> night<00:02:20.320> light<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.040> see<00:02:21.280> in

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
here's the night light as you can see in

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.660 
here's the night light as you can see in
here<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.060> says<00:02:22.240> it's<00:02:22.450> around<00:02:22.690> 71<00:02:23.230> degrees<00:02:23.670> 71.6

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
here it says it's around 71 degrees 71.6

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.810 
here it says it's around 71 degrees 71.6
degrees<00:02:25.060> my<00:02:25.810> other<00:02:26.370> thermometer<00:02:27.370> over<00:02:27.580> there

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
degrees my other thermometer over there

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.450 
degrees my other thermometer over there
says<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.270> about<00:02:28.480> 72<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.860> they're<00:02:30.070> about<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
says it's about 72 so they're about the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.770 
says it's about 72 so they're about the
same<00:02:30.640> but<00:02:30.940> what's<00:02:31.120> really<00:02:31.270> cool<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.510> this

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
same but what's really cool about this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.320 
same but what's really cool about this
as<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.050> can<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.820> doesn't

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
as you can see is that it doesn't

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.470 
as you can see is that it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:34.480> need<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.440> be<00:02:36.150> powered<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
necessarily need to be powered in the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.360 
necessarily need to be powered in the
wall<00:02:37.690> at<00:02:37.960> all<00:02:38.230> times<00:02:38.560> which<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.010> really<00:02:39.190> cool

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
wall at all times which is really cool

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.680 
wall at all times which is really cool
so<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> can<00:02:39.760> kind<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.000> put<00:02:40.210> this<00:02:40.390> anywhere

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
so you can kind of put this anywhere

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.930 
so you can kind of put this anywhere
that's<00:02:41.620> convenient<00:02:42.010> for<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.760> has<00:02:42.910> i

that's convenient for you and it has i

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.200 
that's convenient for you and it has i
think<00:02:43.450> around<00:02:43.540> 13<00:02:44.290> hours<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:45.150> battery<00:02:46.150> life

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
think around 13 hours of battery life

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.360 
think around 13 hours of battery life
which<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:46.810> cool<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.470> um<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.130> one's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
which is really cool so um this one's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.040 
which is really cool so um this one's
actually<00:02:48.520> surprisingly<00:02:49.420> already<00:02:49.900> got<00:02:50.020> a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
actually surprisingly already got a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.840 
actually surprisingly already got a
charge<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.920> that's<00:02:51.100> pretty<00:02:51.280> awesome<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.700> don't

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.130 
top but what's really funny is the look
of<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.300> looks<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.750> something<00:02:59.020> from

what this is probably right here is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.660 
what this is probably right here is
probably<00:03:32.050> somewhere<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:33.190> don't<00:03:33.370> know<00:03:33.580> where

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
probably somewhere I don't know where

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.920 
probably somewhere I don't know where
it's<00:03:33.940> getting<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.240> temperature<00:03:34.600> from<00:03:34.690> maybe

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
it's getting the temperature from maybe

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.960 
it's getting the temperature from maybe
if<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.140> hold<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.530> right<00:03:35.620> here<00:03:35.680> we're<00:03:36.640> gonna<00:03:36.730> see

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
if I hold it right here we're gonna see

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.110 
if I hold it right here we're gonna see
that<00:03:37.120> raised<00:03:37.390> i'm<00:03:38.110> not<00:03:38.380> sure<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:38.910> as<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.030> can

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that raised i'm not sure but as you can

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.910 
that raised i'm not sure but as you can
see<00:03:40.240> in<00:03:40.390> my<00:03:40.420> hand<00:03:40.750> yes<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.170> look<00:03:41.260> at<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.530> see

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
see in my hand yes you look at that see

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.620 
see in my hand yes you look at that see
it's<00:03:42.040> raising<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.640> maybe<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.270> get<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.570> a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
it's raising so maybe we can get it a

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.970 
it's raising so maybe we can get it a
little<00:03:43.720> bit<00:03:43.959> warmer<00:03:44.320> in<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.709> have<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
little bit warmer in here and have the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.370 
little bit warmer in here and have the
have<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.430> color<00:03:45.700> change<00:03:46.090> i<00:03:46.420> don't<00:03:47.200> i'm<00:03:47.350> not

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
have the color change i don't i'm not

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.320 
have the color change i don't i'm not
going<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.680> have<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:47.830> varying<00:03:48.459> color<00:03:48.850> because

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
going to have that varying color because

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.960 
going to have that varying color because
we<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.020> thermostat<00:03:50.830> in<00:03:50.860> central<00:03:51.280> air<00:03:51.459> so

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
we have a thermostat in central air so

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.610 
we have a thermostat in central air so
we<00:03:52.090> don't<00:03:52.270> really<00:03:52.360> have<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.959> use<00:03:53.020> for<00:03:53.320> this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
we don't really have a use for this

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.770 
we don't really have a use for this
necessarily<00:03:54.459> but<00:03:55.000> if<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.300> live<00:03:55.480> in<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.630> place

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
necessarily but if you live in a place

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.770 
necessarily but if you live in a place
where<00:03:56.200> like<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.620> said<00:03:56.890> um<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.970> have<00:03:58.209> air

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
conditioners in every step of room in

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.440 
conditioners in every step of room in
some<00:04:00.370> rooms<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:00.760> don't<00:04:00.940> even<00:04:01.030> have<00:04:01.209> air
