00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey adelis lawns here to fold 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.440
 dotcom entertainment welcome to a 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.710
 new tutorial and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 how to put doors and keys in game 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.039
 maker 8 very well this tutorial is about 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 how to get you to take a key and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.449
 when you take it you can open the door 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.570
 and be able to move to the next level 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.090
 here I already have an object that is the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.070
 player the player and only have the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.669
 basic movements from left to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 right here I have a few sprites 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.660
 which is the key to the door 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 the character from left to right and the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 wall only to make it look a little 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.879
 more complete very well here as 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 we only have the door closed what 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.770
 we will do is we will 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.420
 duplicate the image of the door or the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.730
 sprite of the door we give a click 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.480
 right and we give him to duplicate and that's 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.710
 let's put door 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.020
 open we give here to edit sprite 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 die sprite and we give you here where it says 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.750
 image here we see a few resources 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 that the game maker gives us what we 're going to 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.909
 to do is that we are going to enter here to where 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.450
 says intensity and we're going to click 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.670
 okay 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.130
 if we see if we move from left to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.590
 right here in the value 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.909
 we see that it gets lighter and darker 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.159
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.520
 completely lower the value to zero 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.460
 zero and we will give it to ok 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.039
 so if we see here and then you see 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.990
 like the door is open if 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.780
 you have an open door and you see a lot 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.690
 better than that position is worth what you can 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.000
 do also 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.510
 here we give ok that's to do the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.510
 example 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.870
 ok now let's create a new object and 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.870
 it will be the closed door 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.310
 then we will make another object and it will be 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 the open door 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.880
 finally we created the object that would be 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.880
 the key 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.140
 and we give him ok and now we're going to work 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.420
 a little with the character here very well 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.310
 then what we are going to do is add 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 an event 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.790
 and that we're going to put a key collision 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.250
 when the character collides with the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.840
 key what you are going to do is that you are going to 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.650
 remove the key then we go to the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.730
 tab of main 2 and we give to 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.269
 distribute sens and we give you another 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.400
 then we are going to add this insistent and 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.440
 we will put here who will you 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.319
 apply this what object is going to change 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.260
 is going to become which one very well here 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.040
 We are going to give you an object and we are going to 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.799
 select the door and here below says 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.170
 change in to which is going to change to the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.420
 open door or closed door 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.110
 is going to change to the open door object 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.349
 we give it to ok then we add another 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.360
 event and we give door collision 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.549
 open that is when the character 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.549
 Shock with the door open 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.650
 so here we put it that will happen 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.580
 level logically then we will 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.460
 next band 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.020
 we add it we put an effect on it 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.230
 we give ok 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.200
 Now let's modify the rooms or 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.970
 the levels and for example here I'm going to 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.250
 add the key here the door 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.340
 and the character 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.050
 we give you to play to see how it 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.440
 go 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.540
 very well then I walk towards the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.360
 left and we see that nothing happens if 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.170
 It hit the door but if I go and I take 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.950
 the key automatically changes the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.250
 open door and when he collided with her 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.900
 well then it passes me level here as 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.210
 in the second level I have not done anything 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.690
 I have edited it because it is in this 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.350
 only so 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.750
 very well now let's say we want that 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.820
 the door that does not go immediately to the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.870
 door but when you press for example 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.940
 enter on the keyboard then there goes from 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.430
 level then what we are going to do is 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.450
 that we're going to go to the player's object 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.670
 player and we're going to eliminate this event on 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.130
 which says that when he collides with 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.840
 the open door that goes level 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.000
 we click right and we remove 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.600
 event 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.810
 now we add an event and that we're going to 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.050
 put here press enter for example then 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.020
 let's control and drag this 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.810
 here check out chef 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.610
 and we give where it says and we're going to 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.620
 put an open door and we will give 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.500
 Relative this is when the character 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.080
 is stuck with the door open and 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.820
 press center then what will happen 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.030
 we start a blog here 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.310
 and we go to 2001 and we drag this 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.120
 here that is nexium that will happen to 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.240
 next level then we go to control and 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.800
 we finished the blog now let's go to 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.800
 privatize the game to see what it looks like 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.510
 so if I go here and press enter 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.210
 we see that nothing happens if I go and then 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.760
 I take the key I turn back and I 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.610
 I put in front of the door we see that no 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.350
 nothing happens until you press enter 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.750
 then there it happens because I enter the 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.630
 door as we see did not give an error 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.780
 there is a problem that was that the door was 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.720
 go in front of the character and not by 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.150
 back then to solve 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.580
 this problem I'll show you a trick 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.140
 that maybe some of us already know maybe 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.510
 others do not 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.560
 here the each object when you open it 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:06.120
 we see that says you tell depp 0 all 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.230
 they are in zero this in Spanish means 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.380
 depth 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:16.720
 what if you put depth for example 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:19.750
 1 or 2 means that there will be a layer 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.480
 further back or more or 2 layers further back 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.790
 any object then if you want 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.700
 put that character for example the 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.100
 player in this case is above 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.880
 all objects then you write 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:37.270
 negative 1 that is going to be one more layer 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.550
 in front of all of all the objects 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.650
 that are in the game then yes 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.620
 we write negative 1 and we leave all 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.160
 others at zero when we give to 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.160
 privatize 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.180
 and we go and we take the key then if 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.479
 I stand in front 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.000
 we see that he is already in front of everything 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:04.330
 object when I give people passes from 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.150
 level and so it 's easy and simple to do 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.889
 this of putting doors and keys good my 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.970
 name is a derlis lawns and see you 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.970
 in the next tutorial
