bus<00:02:23.440> which<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> great<00:02:24.010> company<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.670> guess

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
bus which is a great company so I guess

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.420 
bus which is a great company so I guess
we<00:02:24.970> don't<00:02:25.090> mind<00:02:25.660> too<00:02:25.870> much<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.800> competition<00:02:27.340> I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
we don't mind too much for competition I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
we don't mind too much for competition I
guess<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.850> all<00:02:28.030> about<00:02:28.240> going<00:02:28.570> faster<00:02:29.320> than

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
guess it's all about going faster than

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.570 
guess it's all about going faster than
then<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.900> yeah<00:02:31.900> your<00:02:32.860> employees<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.400> be

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
then and yeah your employees can be

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.150 
then and yeah your employees can be
really<00:02:33.850> uncomfortable<00:02:33.970> as<00:02:34.690> well<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.380> they

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
really uncomfortable as well so they

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.070 
really uncomfortable as well so they
could<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.610> talk<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.240> know<00:02:37.360> they<00:02:37.570> would<00:02:37.840> not

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
could not talk you know they would not

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.720 
could not talk you know they would not
probably<00:02:38.350> talk<00:02:38.710> for<00:02:38.920> weather<00:02:39.130> with<00:02:39.250> duck<00:02:39.580> if

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
probably talk for weather with duck if

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.330 
probably talk for weather with duck if
you<00:02:39.880> had<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.330> meeting<00:02:40.570> with<00:02:40.780> 10<00:02:41.080> people<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:42.250> a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
you had a meeting with 10 people in a

do<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:45.010> probably<00:02:45.640> wouldn't<00:02:46.120> imagine<00:02:46.660> if<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
do it I probably wouldn't imagine if it

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.530 
do it I probably wouldn't imagine if it
goes<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.650> know<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.220> bad<00:02:48.370> times<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
recession imagine if you have to lead to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.930 
recession imagine if you have to lead to
a<00:02:53.020> decision<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.010> know<00:02:54.100> let<00:02:54.250> let<00:02:54.700> someone

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
on ustream you know not sure I think

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.800 
on ustream you know not sure I think
here<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.020> it's<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.620> step<00:03:02.860> beyond<00:03:03.780> what<00:03:04.780> i

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
here it's it's one step beyond what i

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.380 
here it's it's one step beyond what i
would<00:03:05.050> do<00:03:05.200> would<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.710> do<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:06.390> interesting
