this<00:00:00.359> is<00:00:00.480> what<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.659> turbo<00:00:01.110> looks<00:00:01.350> like<00:00:01.650> cut<00:00:02.310> away

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
this is what a turbo looks like cut away

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.960 
this is what a turbo looks like cut away
in<00:00:02.939> some<00:00:03.270> portions<00:00:03.780> this<00:00:04.680> isn't<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.220> cut<00:00:05.819> in

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
in some portions this isn't a cut in

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.509 
in some portions this isn't a cut in
half<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> kind<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.750> cut<00:00:06.899> away<00:00:07.109> but<00:00:07.410> it's<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:08.280> has

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
half a kind of cut away but it's it has

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.610 
half a kind of cut away but it's it has
a<00:00:08.550> quarter<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.300> taken<00:00:09.690> out<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.380> blue

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
a quarter of it taken out the blue

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.310 
a quarter of it taken out the blue
portion<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.360> supposed<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> intake

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
portion is supposed to be the intake

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.379 
portion is supposed to be the intake
which<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.429> cool<00:00:14.700> air<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.210> can

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
which is going to be cool air you can

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.080 
which is going to be cool air you can
think<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> hair<00:00:17.460> coming<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
think that as the hair coming in is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.370 
think that as the hair coming in is
going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.390> colder<00:00:18.720> than<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> exhaust

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
going to be colder than the exhaust

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.700 
going to be colder than the exhaust
which<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:19.980> red<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.689> red<00:00:21.689> portion<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.410> going

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
which is in red the red portion is going

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
which is in red the red portion is going
to<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.859> hot<00:00:23.039> air<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.390> combustion<00:00:24.750> has

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
to be hot air because the combustion has

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
to be hot air because the combustion has
already<00:00:25.289> happened<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.730> air<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.119> being

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
already happened and that air is being

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
already happened and that air is being
pushed<00:00:27.599> out<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.170> air<00:00:28.949> from<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> engine<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
pushed out the air from the engine is

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.270 
pushed out the air from the engine is
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.090> coming<00:00:30.390> through<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:31.800> area<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
going to be coming through this area and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.490 
going to be coming through this area and
spinning<00:00:35.280> around<00:00:35.399> through<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.469> it<00:00:37.469> will

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
spinning around through here and it will

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.310 
spinning around through here and it will
come<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.360> we<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> color<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.140> work

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
come down we get a color that will work

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560 
come down we get a color that will work
the<00:00:40.980> air<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> engine<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> spin

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the air from the engine is going to spin

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
the air from the engine is going to spin
around<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.620> come<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.789> through<00:00:45.059> here

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
around in here and come out through here

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.290 
around in here and come out through here
and<00:00:45.600> exit<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> way<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.879> does<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and exit this way and what that does it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.920 
and exit this way and what that does it
the<00:00:48.719> air<00:00:48.899> blowing<00:00:49.500> past<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.449> forces<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the air blowing past this forces this to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.500 
the air blowing past this forces this to
turn<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:54.260> because<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.680> connected

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
turn and because this is connected

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.920 
turn and because this is connected
through<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.780> center<00:00:58.469> shaft<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.239> will

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
through the center shaft here it will

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
through the center shaft here it will
force<00:01:01.320> air<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
force air in here up around here to the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270 
force air in here up around here to the
engine<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:07.200> circle<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
engine this circle here is going to be a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.310 
engine this circle here is going to be a
loop<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.780> allow<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.439> best<00:01:11.100> air<00:01:11.430> flow

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
loop which will allow the best air flow

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
loop which will allow the best air flow
because<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:14.280> fan<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.659> on

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because this fan is going to be going on

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
because this fan is going to be going on
at<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.229> top<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.830> bottom<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> sides<00:01:17.549> all

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
at the top and bottom and the sides all

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.100 
at the top and bottom and the sides all
at<00:01:18.180> once<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.840> round<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:21.450> doesn't

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
at once it's round and it doesn't

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
at once it's round and it doesn't
constantly<00:01:22.470> blow<00:01:22.799> air<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.850> blows<00:01:24.180> air<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
constantly blow air up it blows air in

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.990 
constantly blow air up it blows air in
all<00:01:24.840> directions<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> chamber

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
all directions and if you have a chamber

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.620 
all directions and if you have a chamber
that<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.360> accept<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:28.020> directions<00:01:28.380> then

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that will accept all directions then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.310 
that will accept all directions then
channel<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> air<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.159> exit<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
channel that air to the exit here and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.719 
channel that air to the exit here and
you'll<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.770> effective<00:01:34.979> turbo<00:01:35.579> it's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you'll have a more effective turbo it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.270 
you'll have a more effective turbo it's
a<00:01:35.960> design<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.020> pretty<00:01:37.439> much<00:01:37.619> every<00:01:37.950> turbo

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
a design that pretty much every turbo

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580 
a design that pretty much every turbo
has<00:01:38.490> anyway<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.140> air<00:01:40.290> from

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
has anyway because the air from

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.490 
has anyway because the air from
combustion<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.400> expanded<00:01:42.030> because

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
combustion has expanded because

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
combustion has expanded because
everything<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.890> heat<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.130> expands

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
everything that you heat up expands

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.319 
everything that you heat up expands
that's<00:01:45.930> where<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.579> extra<00:01:47.579> energy<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.030> coming

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that's where the extra energy is coming

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.730 
that's where the extra energy is coming
from<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.070> air<00:01:50.070> coming<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.740> going

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
from the air coming out of here is going

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
from the air coming out of here is going
to<00:01:52.860> already<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.340> expanded<00:01:54.090> by<00:01:54.119> heat<00:01:54.689> which

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to already be expanded by heat which

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.940 
to already be expanded by heat which
means<00:01:55.770> more<00:01:56.600> pressure<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.869> able<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> turn<00:01:58.680> this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
means more pressure is able to turn this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.639 
means more pressure is able to turn this
so<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.210> amount<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> energy<00:02:00.810> required<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
so the amount of energy required to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.840 
so the amount of energy required to
spend<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.479> will<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.689> balance<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:05.070> will

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
spend this will not balance out it will

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.900 
spend this will not balance out it will
actually<00:02:06.000> improve<00:02:06.630> engine<00:02:07.590> power<00:02:07.799> because

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
actually improve engine power because

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.290 
actually improve engine power because
it<00:02:09.210> takes<00:02:09.570> less<00:02:10.260> energy<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.220> bring<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.970> cold

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
it takes less energy to bring in cold
