all<00:00:01.469> right<00:00:01.680> today<00:00:02.010> we're<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> be<00:00:02.850> taking

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
all right today we're going to be taking

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.789 
all right today we're going to be taking
our<00:00:03.210> first<00:00:03.389> steps<00:00:03.510> in<00:00:03.840> assembly<00:00:04.319> which<00:00:04.560> will

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
our first steps in assembly which will

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.400 
our first steps in assembly which will
be<00:00:05.000> connecting<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> aileron<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.600> flaps<00:00:07.020> to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
be connecting the aileron and flaps to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.180 
be connecting the aileron and flaps to
the<00:00:07.620> wing<00:00:08.130> basically<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.800> glue<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the wing basically we have to glue the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.339 
the wing basically we have to glue the
ailerons<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> flaps<00:00:12.210> onto<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> wing

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
ailerons and the flaps onto the wing

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.090 
ailerons and the flaps onto the wing
with<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> hint<00:00:14.940> style<00:00:15.179> hinges<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.710> will

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
with see a hint style hinges and I will

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700 
with see a hint style hinges and I will
just<00:00:17.310> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> capture<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.720> process<00:00:19.470> here

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
just kind of capture the process here

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.429 
just kind of capture the process here
and<00:00:19.939> let<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:23.510> so<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> aileron<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:25.199> has

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and let you see so the aileron now has

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.640 
and let you see so the aileron now has
been<00:00:25.849> pre<00:00:26.849> fitted<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:27.869> hinges<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
been pre fitted with these hinges and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.380 
been pre fitted with these hinges and
I'm<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> slide<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:29.789> place

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I'm just going to slide it into place

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840 
I'm just going to slide it into place
the<00:00:30.810> next<00:00:31.170> step<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.590> want<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.399> make

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the next step that I want to do is make

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
the next step that I want to do is make
sure<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> I've<00:00:33.360> got<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.719> widths<00:00:34.250> between<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
sure that I've got my widths between the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.639 
sure that I've got my widths between the
flaps<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> actual<00:00:36.870> wing<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
flaps and the actual wing and the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.360 
flaps and the actual wing and the
aileron<00:00:38.329> somewhat<00:00:39.620> concordant<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
aileron somewhat concordant and what I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.040 
aileron somewhat concordant and what I
found<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.390> I've<00:00:42.600> used<00:00:42.629> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
found actually is I've used this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.740 
found actually is I've used this
popsicle<00:00:43.920> stick<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> spacer<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.450> going

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
popsicle stick as a spacer so I'm going

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
popsicle stick as a spacer so I'm going
in<00:00:45.899> between<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.770> flap<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> ale<00:00:47.670> around

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in between the flap and the ale around

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.110 
in between the flap and the ale around
there<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.530> adjusting<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> width<00:00:50.250> using<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
there and adjusting the width using a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
there and adjusting the width using a
pop<00:00:51.329> popsicle<00:00:52.110> stick<00:00:52.350> obviously<00:00:53.219> for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
pop popsicle stick obviously for

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.650 
pop popsicle stick obviously for
different<00:00:53.730> size<00:00:53.879> models<00:00:54.329> it'll<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
different size models it'll be a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.700 
different size models it'll be a
different<00:00:56.180> gauge<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:58.199> measure<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
different gauge to to measure the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
different gauge to to measure the
thickness<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.109> rough

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
thickness there but this is just a rough

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
thickness there but this is just a rough
in<00:01:01.590> allows<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.399> determine<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.570> I've<00:01:03.690> got

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
in allows me to determine that I've got

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
in allows me to determine that I've got
a<00:01:04.110> nice<00:01:05.689> uniform<00:01:06.740> space<00:01:07.740> between<00:01:08.280> these

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a nice uniform space between these

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.660 
a nice uniform space between these
control<00:01:08.909> surfaces<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.520> little

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
control surfaces so it's just one little

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.100 
control surfaces so it's just one little
step<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.360> recommend<00:01:12.840> doing<00:01:12.990> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
step here that I recommend doing that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.780 
step here that I recommend doing that
way<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> stand<00:01:14.040> back<00:01:14.189> take<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:14.520> at

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
way when you stand back take a look at

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.310 
way when you stand back take a look at
it<00:01:14.939> everything<00:01:15.330> looks<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.689> uniformly

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it everything looks to be uniformly

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.240 
it everything looks to be uniformly
spaced<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> next<00:01:18.150> step<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
spaced so the next step is is just to

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.940 
spaced so the next step is is just to
squeeze<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:21.540> aileron<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
squeeze these this aileron in to the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
squeeze these this aileron in to the
wing<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.880> will<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.180> removing

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
wing here and then I will be removing

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.020 
wing here and then I will be removing
the<00:01:24.840> t<00:01:25.110> pins<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.740> hitting<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:26.820> CA

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the t pins and hitting it with some CA

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
the t pins and hitting it with some CA
so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.320> put<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.799> pause<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so I got to put put you on pause here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.140 
so I got to put put you on pause here
for<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.460> second<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.030> I'll<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.360> back<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> few

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
for a second but I'll be back in a few

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.060 
for a second but I'll be back in a few
so<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.869> aileron<00:01:34.290> dry<00:01:34.619> fit

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so now that I have my aileron dry fit

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
so now that I have my aileron dry fit
into<00:01:35.369> place<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> spacing

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
into place that you can see the spacing

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
into place that you can see the spacing
is<00:01:37.409> uh<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.369> uniform<00:01:38.850> between<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
is uh it's pretty uniform between the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
is uh it's pretty uniform between the
flaps<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.710> wing<00:01:40.890> itself<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.729> gonna

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
flaps and the the wing itself I'm gonna

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.950 
flaps and the the wing itself I'm gonna
run<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.540> thin<00:01:42.899> bead<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.350> CA<00:01:43.970> which<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.570> ultra

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
run a thin bead of CA which is the ultra

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.219 
run a thin bead of CA which is the ultra
thin<00:01:46.140> CA<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.090> actual<00:01:48.540> hinge<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
thin CA on the actual hinge and that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
thin CA on the actual hinge and that
hinge<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.680> wick<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.189> CA<00:01:50.430> into<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> balsa

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
hinge will wick the CA into the balsa

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800 
hinge will wick the CA into the balsa
and<00:01:52.100> fasten<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> wing<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and fasten it to the wing so and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.380 
and fasten it to the wing so and
actually<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> aileron<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.369> I'll<00:01:56.909> run<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
actually to the aileron so I'll run that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
actually to the aileron so I'll run that
thin<00:01:57.689> bead<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.049> CA<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.530> there

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
thin bead of CA in there

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:15.730 
thin bead of CA in there
and<00:01:59.090> it<00:02:00.090> should<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.329> good<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.570> go

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.100 

all<00:02:16.740> right<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.760> aileron<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.480> glued<00:02:18.750> from<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
all right the aileron is glued from the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.050 
all right the aileron is glued from the
top<00:02:19.290> down<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> will<00:02:19.920> flip<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.520> over<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.940> when

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
top down I will flip it over here when

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.630 
top down I will flip it over here when
the<00:02:21.180> CA<00:02:21.390> sets<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.260> little<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.770> do<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the CA sets just a little bit and do the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
the CA sets just a little bit and do the
same<00:02:23.850> procedure<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.660> bottom<00:02:24.960> side<00:02:25.110> and

same procedure on the bottom side and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.280 
same procedure on the bottom side and
that<00:02:26.490> aileron<00:02:26.970> will<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.210> nice<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.750> snug<00:02:27.960> and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
secure onto the wing all right we have

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.310 
secure onto the wing all right we have
the<00:02:32.370> servos<00:02:33.000> installed<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.540> here's<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.020> LaRon

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
the servos installed now here's a LaRon

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.170 
the servos installed now here's a LaRon
and<00:02:34.620> flaps<00:02:35.450> servo<00:02:36.450> extensions<00:02:36.990> coming<00:02:37.320> out

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
and flaps servo extensions coming out

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.310 
and flaps servo extensions coming out
that's<00:02:39.180> what<00:02:39.300> she<00:02:39.450> looks<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.050> need<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
that's what she looks like I need to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.790 
that's what she looks like I need to
install<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.990> horns<00:02:42.990> now<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.470> control

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
install the horns now on the control

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.460 
install the horns now on the control
surfaces<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.990> she'll<00:02:45.990> be<00:02:46.050> ready<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.380> go

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
surfaces and she'll be ready to go

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.310 
surfaces and she'll be ready to go
that's<00:02:46.710> one<00:02:47.130> wing<00:02:47.430> complete<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:48.810> half<00:02:49.110> of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
that's one wing complete or one half of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.400 
that's one wing complete or one half of
the<00:02:49.410> wing<00:02:49.590> completes<00:02:52.400> okay<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.610> wing<00:02:53.880> is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the wing completes okay the wing is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.750 
the wing completes okay the wing is
somewhat<00:02:55.410> temporarily<00:02:56.010> joined<00:02:56.459> together

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
somewhat temporarily joined together

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.720 
somewhat temporarily joined together
right<00:02:57.240> now<00:02:57.350> but<00:02:58.350> that's<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.100> first<00:02:59.280> look<00:02:59.550> at

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
right now but that's the first look at

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.100 
right now but that's the first look at
what<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.000> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> look<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
what it's going to look like on the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.800 
what it's going to look like on the
