$10 worth of parts to do this let's talk
about<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> parts<00:00:24.060> we're<00:00:24.180> gonna<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
about the parts we're gonna have to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.009 
about the parts we're gonna have to
assemble<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:26.070> make<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.430> bottle<00:00:26.789> filler<00:00:27.019> the

assemble to make this bottle filler the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.859 
assemble to make this bottle filler the
first<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> about<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.859> 1<00:00:29.130> foot<00:00:29.310> long<00:00:29.580> section<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
first is about a 1 foot long section of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.580 
first is about a 1 foot long section of
3/8<00:00:31.289> racking<00:00:32.189> cane<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:34.079> been<00:00:34.320> cut

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
3/8 racking cane that that's been cut

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.229 
3/8 racking cane that that's been cut
off<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> most<00:00:35.219> people<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> broken<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.210> of

off and most people have a broken one of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.450 
off and most people have a broken one of
these<00:00:36.420> laying<00:00:36.630> around<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:38.190> want<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
these laying around so you you want to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090 
these laying around so you you want to
cut<00:00:38.670> an<00:00:38.940> angle<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> ends<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
cut an angle on one of the ends a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.869 
cut an angle on one of the ends a
45-degree<00:00:41.910> angle<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.789> not

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
45-degree angle or so so that you're not

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
45-degree angle or so so that you're not
stopping<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.450> flow<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> beer<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> bottom

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
stopping the flow of beer at the bottom

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.729 
stopping the flow of beer at the bottom
of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> bottle<00:00:48.379> you're<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of the bottle you're gonna need a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.709 
of the bottle you're gonna need a
stopper

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
stopper

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
stopper
that's<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.960> appropriate<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> opening<00:00:53.760> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that's a appropriate for the opening of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.709 
that's a appropriate for the opening of
a<00:00:53.969> beer<00:00:54.180> bottle<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> I'll<00:00:56.250> show<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
a beer bottle and I'll show you how that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.719 
a beer bottle and I'll show you how that
fits<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.250> neck<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.699> beer<00:00:59.879> bottle

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.910 

next<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:05.970> gonna<00:01:06.030> need<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:07.520> if<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
next thing you're gonna need is if a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
next thing you're gonna need is if a
picnic<00:01:10.920> faucet<00:01:11.369> set<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.540> beer<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.260> keg

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
picnic faucet set with your beer out keg

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390 
picnic faucet set with your beer out keg
disconnect<00:01:14.420> about<00:01:15.420> 5<00:01:15.659> feet<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.170> 3/16<00:01:17.009> tubing

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
disconnect about 5 feet of 3/16 tubing

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.999 
disconnect about 5 feet of 3/16 tubing
and<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.659> cheap<00:01:19.530> three<00:01:20.250> dollar<00:01:20.460> picnic<00:01:21.270> faucet

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and a cheap three dollar picnic faucet

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
and a cheap three dollar picnic faucet
so<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.340> usually<00:01:23.759> take<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.790> top<00:01:27.030> post<00:01:27.840> out

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so I usually take the the top post out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
so I usually take the the top post out
of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> disconnects<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.579> free

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of the disconnects so that you can free

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.730 
of the disconnects so that you can free
flow<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.590> sanitizer<00:01:32.100> through<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> tubing

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
flow the sanitizer through the tubing

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.899 
flow the sanitizer through the tubing
and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.310> throw<00:01:35.490> everything<00:01:35.759> else<00:01:36.119> into<00:01:36.810> my

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
and I just throw everything else into my

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
and I just throw everything else into my
container<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.210> sanitizer<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> I'm<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.619> going

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
container of sanitizer so I'm just going

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
container of sanitizer so I'm just going
to<00:01:43.860> mix<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.490> bit<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:45.229> iodophor

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to mix up a little bit of iodophor

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:59.210 
to mix up a little bit of iodophor
solution<00:01:46.770> here

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.649 

it's<00:02:00.220> slightly<00:02:00.430> more<00:02:00.610> concentrated<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.479> needs

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
it's slightly more concentrated it needs

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.340 
it's slightly more concentrated it needs
to<00:02:01.810> be<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.110> I'm<00:02:02.380> heading<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:04.350> some

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
to be because I'm heading it to some

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.740 
to be because I'm heading it to some
additional<00:02:05.799> water<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.340> here<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.720> just

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
additional water I have here and I just

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.309 
additional water I have here and I just
figured<00:02:14.110> out<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> trick<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:15.250> order<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:16.319> pump

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
figured out a trick in order to pump

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.949 
figured out a trick in order to pump
sanitizer<00:02:17.920> through<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:19.060> thin<00:02:19.300> tubing<00:02:19.780> which

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
sanitizer through the thin tubing which

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.470 
sanitizer through the thin tubing which
is<00:02:20.110> sometimes<00:02:20.470> difficult<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.519> get<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.269> flow

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
is sometimes difficult to get the flow

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.220 
is sometimes difficult to get the flow
if<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.870> coil<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> under<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> sanitizer

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
if you just coil it under the sanitizer

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.780 
if you just coil it under the sanitizer
just<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.590> fits<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.099> racking<00:02:27.430> cane<00:02:27.459> it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
just like it fits the racking cane it

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.050 
just like it fits the racking cane it
also<00:02:27.910> fits<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.599> neck<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.709> an<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.400> cane<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.940> an

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
also fits the neck of an the cane of an

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
also fits the neck of an the cane of an
auto<00:02:31.209> siphon<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:32.019> as<00:02:32.440> long<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.130> your

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
auto siphon and as long as you have your

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.880 
auto siphon and as long as you have your
disconnect<00:02:36.569> down<00:02:37.569> in<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.840> sanitizer<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.709> can

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
disconnect down in the sanitizer you can

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.370 
disconnect down in the sanitizer you can
use<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.400> auto<00:02:39.790> siphon<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.569> pump<00:02:40.840> sanitizer

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
use the auto siphon to pump sanitizer

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
use the auto siphon to pump sanitizer
through<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.489> inside<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:44.250> tubing<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:50.400> now

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
through the inside of the tubing and now

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400 
through the inside of the tubing and now
if<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.549> just<00:02:51.700> let<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.000> sit<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.989> know<00:02:53.170> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
if you just let that sit you know that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.550 
if you just let that sit you know that
there's<00:02:55.019> closed<00:02:56.019> your<00:02:56.200> faucet<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:59.500> you

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
inside of your bottle so you can go

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:21.270 
inside of your bottle so you can go
ahead<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.720> drop<00:03:11.019> these<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.440> sanitizer<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
bottle caps as well then we're going to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.840 
bottle caps as well then we're going to
let<00:03:26.709> those<00:03:26.859> sit<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.190> there<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.310> five<00:03:27.639> minutes

a<00:03:28.470> few<00:03:29.470> things<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.799> need<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.069> do<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> kegs

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
a few things we need to do to the kegs

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.180 
a few things we need to do to the kegs
and<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.120> pressure<00:03:31.510> itself<00:03:31.989> we<00:03:32.709> don't<00:03:32.889> want<00:03:33.040> to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
and the pressure itself we don't want to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.120 
and the pressure itself we don't want to
pour<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.810> foam<00:03:34.810> up<00:03:35.019> too<00:03:35.290> much<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.769> we<00:03:35.889> want<00:03:36.040> to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
pour and foam up too much so we want to

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.090 
pour and foam up too much so we want to
reduce<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.579> pressure<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> kegs<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.920> about

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
reduce the pressure on the kegs to about

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.420 
reduce the pressure on the kegs to about

your<00:05:55.430> bottle<00:05:55.730> on<00:05:55.850> there<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.450> insert<00:05:57.410> the

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
your bottle on there and insert the

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.930 
your bottle on there and insert the
stopper<00:05:59.710> like<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:03.250> now<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.310> can<00:06:04.550> open<00:06:04.700> up

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
stopper like that now you can open up

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.400 
stopper like that now you can open up
your<00:06:06.460> picnic<00:06:07.460> faucet<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:08.960> that<00:06:09.050> was<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.230> beer

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
your picnic faucet and that was the beer

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.500 
your picnic faucet and that was the beer
flows<00:06:09.620> into<00:06:09.980> the<00:06:10.070> bottle<00:06:10.430> it's<00:06:11.120> going<00:06:11.330> to<00:06:11.390> be

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
flows into the bottle it's going to be

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.160 
flows into the bottle it's going to be
building<00:06:11.720> pressure<00:06:12.710> up<00:06:13.040> into<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.520> bottle<00:06:14.170> if

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
building pressure up into the bottle if

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.350 
building pressure up into the bottle if
you<00:06:15.290> use<00:06:15.440> your<00:06:15.590> finger<00:06:15.950> to<00:06:15.980> just<00:06:16.340> push<00:06:17.000> on<00:06:17.180> the

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
you use your finger to just push on the

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.060 
you use your finger to just push on the
side<00:06:17.570> of<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:17.870> stopper<00:06:18.320> to<00:06:18.470> deform<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:19.040> a

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
side of the stopper to deform it a

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.690 
side of the stopper to deform it a
little<00:06:19.340> bit<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:20.630> can<00:06:20.750> get<00:06:21.340> see<00:06:22.340> if<00:06:22.430> you<00:06:22.520> can

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
little bit you can get see if you can

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.220 
little bit you can get see if you can
see<00:06:22.940> that<00:06:23.120> beer<00:06:23.360> coming<00:06:23.750> up<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.990> don't<00:06:27.050> want

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
see that beer coming up you don't want

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.870 
see that beer coming up you don't want
to<00:06:27.290> go<00:06:27.380> too<00:06:27.440> fast<00:06:27.830> you<00:06:28.130> don't<00:06:28.280> want<00:06:28.430> too<00:06:28.670> much

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
to go too fast you don't want too much

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.460 
to go too fast you don't want too much
of<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.150> pressure<00:06:29.360> to<00:06:29.660> be<00:06:29.810> released<00:06:30.170> and

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
of the pressure to be released and

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.570 
of the pressure to be released and
you'll<00:06:30.590> get<00:06:31.160> all<00:06:31.220> that<00:06:31.610> co2<00:06:31.820> out<00:06:32.210> of<00:06:32.330> solution

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
you'll get all that co2 out of solution

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.040 
you'll get all that co2 out of solution
but<00:06:34.580> as<00:06:34.730> I<00:06:34.850> watch<00:06:35.060> it<00:06:35.270> I<00:06:35.360> can<00:06:35.510> only<00:06:35.630> there's

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
but as I watch it I can only there's

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.630 
but as I watch it I can only there's
only<00:06:36.140> about<00:06:36.500> a<00:06:36.530> sixteenth<00:06:37.070> of<00:06:37.220> an<00:06:37.340> inch<00:06:37.430> of

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
only about a sixteenth of an inch of

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.040 
only about a sixteenth of an inch of
foam<00:06:37.850> on<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.210> top<00:06:38.390> of<00:06:38.630> there<00:06:38.750> which<00:06:38.900> is

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
foam on the top of there which is

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.070 
foam on the top of there which is
exactly<00:06:39.230> what<00:06:39.710> you<00:06:39.860> want<00:06:40.510> and<00:06:41.510> you<00:06:41.840> want<00:06:41.960> to

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
exactly what you want and you want to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.120 
exactly what you want and you want to
slow<00:06:42.260> it<00:06:42.380> down<00:06:42.410> as<00:06:42.680> you<00:06:42.740> get<00:06:42.890> to<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.190> top<00:06:45.130> you

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
slow it down as you get to the top you

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.530 
slow it down as you get to the top you
want<00:06:46.280> to<00:06:46.340> fill<00:06:46.460> it<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:46.970> very<00:06:47.180> top<00:06:47.510> because

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
want to fill it to the very top because

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.050 
want to fill it to the very top because
as<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.260> pull<00:06:48.500> this<00:06:48.680> out<00:06:48.890> it's<00:06:49.640> gonna<00:06:49.760> leave<00:06:50.030> a

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
as you pull this out it's gonna leave a

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.219 
as you pull this out it's gonna leave a
little<00:06:50.210> bit<00:06:50.420> of<00:06:50.510> space

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.279 

so<00:06:56.229> there's<00:06:56.410> about<00:06:57.360> maybe<00:06:58.360> an<00:06:58.960> inch<00:06:59.139> ahead

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
so there's about maybe an inch ahead

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:00.960 
so there's about maybe an inch ahead
space<00:06:59.710> and<00:06:59.949> I'm<00:07:00.009> actually<00:07:00.160> gonna<00:07:00.370> top<00:07:00.639> it<00:07:00.849> off

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
space and I'm actually gonna top it off

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.480 
space and I'm actually gonna top it off
just<00:07:01.180> a<00:07:01.330> little<00:07:01.750> bit<00:07:01.900> more<00:07:02.139> I<00:07:02.440> don't<00:07:03.069> want<00:07:03.310> any

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
just a little bit more I don't want any

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.950 
just a little bit more I don't want any
air<00:07:03.729> in<00:07:03.909> there<00:07:04.060> I'd<00:07:04.240> rather<00:07:04.419> have<00:07:04.690> a<00:07:04.720> little

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
air in there I'd rather have a little

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.779 
air in there I'd rather have a little
bit<00:07:05.139> of<00:07:05.169> foam<00:07:05.440> at<00:07:05.620> the<00:07:05.680> very<00:07:05.979> top<00:07:06.250> that<00:07:06.520> I<00:07:06.550> put

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
bit of foam at the very top that I put

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.850 
bit of foam at the very top that I put
the<00:07:06.879> cap<00:07:07.120> on<00:07:08.879> okay<00:07:10.229> so<00:07:11.229> you<00:07:11.319> can<00:07:11.440> see<00:07:11.680> that

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
the cap on okay so you can see that

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.980 
the cap on okay so you can see that
there's<00:07:12.069> just<00:07:12.250> a<00:07:12.430> little<00:07:12.699> bit<00:07:13.000> of<00:07:13.150> headspace

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
there's just a little bit of headspace

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.930 
there's just a little bit of headspace
in<00:07:14.169> there<00:07:14.349> and<00:07:15.039> I'm<00:07:15.129> going<00:07:15.250> to<00:07:15.310> put<00:07:15.460> the<00:07:15.550> cap<00:07:15.759> on

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
in there and I'm going to put the cap on

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.270 
in there and I'm going to put the cap on
this<00:07:16.120> immediately<00:07:16.770> we're<00:07:17.770> not<00:07:17.919> going<00:07:18.039> to<00:07:18.069> cap

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
this immediately we're not going to cap

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.749 
this immediately we're not going to cap
it<00:07:18.460> just<00:07:18.639> yet<00:07:18.849> I<00:07:19.470> want<00:07:20.470> any<00:07:20.650> little<00:07:20.889> bit<00:07:21.129> of<00:07:21.280> co2

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
it just yet I want any little bit of co2

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.059 
it just yet I want any little bit of co2
that<00:07:22.000> wants<00:07:22.930> to<00:07:22.990> come<00:07:23.199> out<00:07:23.319> of<00:07:23.349> solution<00:07:23.949> to

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:24.069 
that wants to come out of solution to

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.100 
that wants to come out of solution to
