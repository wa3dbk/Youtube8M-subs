00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.980
 new ones teaching you what is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 really the content of these boxes 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.620
 for those who are interested in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.530
 buy the phone or have it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.469
 bought and want to actually see if 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.840
 its content is what this must be 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.420
 phone is bought by operator as well 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.489
 that we are sure that what is 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.450
 who comes here if they buy the phones 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.509

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
 with san andrecitos will surely take you out 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.460
 things where they sell them completely with 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.369
 what comes many times they take away the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 venues at home and the traditional ones is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.049
 remove chargers so I recommend them 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.399
 I want your operators to be clear 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.820
 movistar or tivo and buy the phone 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.820

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.330

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.500
 It is a very good size phone but 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.070
 with wifi gps of very good taste comes to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.530
 Hertz main or rear camera with its 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 microphone what we can see this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.770

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.619
 how it has to be 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.020
