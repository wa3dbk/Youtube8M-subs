00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.240 

I'll<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:31.990> give<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.290> nice<00:01:32.409> little<00:01:32.619> slow

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250

start

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.850 

now<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.450> continue<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.080> let<00:01:43.230> this<00:01:43.410> go<00:01:43.620> what

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
now if you continue to let this go what

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.990 
now if you continue to let this go what
would<00:01:43.980> happen<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.550> would<00:01:44.580> just<00:01:44.820> become

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
would happen is it would just become

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
would happen is it would just become
thicker<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.690> thicker<00:01:45.900> and<00:01:46.080> thicker<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.650> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
thicker and thicker and thicker when it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.630 
thicker and thicker and thicker when it
was<00:01:46.860> cooled<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.860> point<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.490> has

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
was cooled so at this point this has

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.400 
was cooled so at this point this has
been<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:51.060> long<00:01:51.420> enough<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.080> just<00:01:52.260> going

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
been going long enough so I'm just going

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.900 
been going long enough so I'm just going
to<00:01:52.500> turn<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.800> off<00:01:52.920> now<00:01:53.750> there<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
to turn it off now there we go and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.940 
to turn it off now there we go and
that's<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.120> for<00:01:57.270> simple<00:01:57.660> syrup<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> can

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that's it for simple syrup so you can

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.710 
that's it for simple syrup so you can
add<00:01:59.100> anything<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.940> like<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.330> was<00:02:00.510> saying
