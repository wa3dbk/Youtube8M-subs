00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 And then people are going to fall asleep and welcome. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.490
 But the video this time I'm going to tell 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.830
 about hardware and how to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 take care of keeping this video up to date 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.670
 is part of the series renewing your pc 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.470
 So I'm going into this video here that's the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.000
 video so they can then 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 know all the videos that are part 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 of this series what is in each of them is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 very important to keep your computer 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 clean only three months later is already the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.220
 sufficient to reduce the effectiveness of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.710
 of your computer 's cooling and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 so your computer's performance one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.469
 time temperatures will be fine 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.640
 higher than they should 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.980
 when I cleaned this computer from 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 video guys without joking the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.780
 temperatures of my graphics cards 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.570
 fell more than 20 degrees 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.579
 that's quite the temperatures they 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 they reached almost a hundred degrees while I 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 I was playing and after I made the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.010
 cleaning them return to their normal 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 70 to 75 degrees 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.329
 Yes, of course these are not the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 cooler graphics cards that exist 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 in the world 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.190
 The problem is that these high 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 temperatures in addition to decreasing life 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.140
 useful of the ray of yours still 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.510
 performance, the lower the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 higher temperature stability and the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 performance on your side 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.220
 so it's good to always keep the computer 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.020
 clean and organized does not have any 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.850
 secret to cleaning the computer galley 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.770
 in this video and you can see that I 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 I'm using a dust cloth to get the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 dust from my computer windows and air 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.020
 tablet to clean more 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.540
 hard to clean 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.400
 such as the sinks 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.439
 main parts to clean up are the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 sinks, especially those of the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.619
 your processor and graphics card and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.689
 This is it people 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.310
 do not neglect cleaning your computer 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.960
 Of you, that 's it guys, next time. 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.220
 video will format the machine then I will 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.850
 give some tips regarding this 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.380
 subject matter 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 Thank you for insisting that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.759
 lilic favorite 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.759
