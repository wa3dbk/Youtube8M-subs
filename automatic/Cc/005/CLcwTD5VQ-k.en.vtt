00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 on Saturday , September 22, he took 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.580
 out in the sports unit of the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 kukulcán the first rugby match 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
 official in merida in which 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.720
 they faced the biggest rugby club 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.239
 mérida against the convergent cancún in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 where in the middle of typing and you pass to high 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.419
 speeds you could breathe the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.160
 attention and emotion of the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.160
 spectators and clear in the players 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.640
 for the arbitration of the party the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.050
 presence of camilo falcón álvarez who 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.019
 he told us a little about that 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.710
 sport I think it's going to grow a lot 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.780
 a sport 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.270
 then contact vision is a 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.100
 universal dynamic sport for 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.290
 rugby players all attack all 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.809
 they defend there are positions they ruled there 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.079
 front and backs for games that 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.160
 they are the back of the formations 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.989
 but unlike American football 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.940
 that can be compared a bit in the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.750
 rugby all attack all these fingers without 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.300
 scoring opportunity came back with 13 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.250
 cases then you're still in rugby formulated 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.390
 if someone bleeds his nose maybe 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 sometime once in a while and where 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.740
 scale won but are children injuries 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.530
 more compared to a role break and other 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.119
 something more mortality is a very report 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.240
 fun people think it's to play 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.909
 he falls in love with this sport 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.030
 and then we wait like the federation 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.869
 I grew up not a few years ago here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.909
 teams now we're talking in 46 in 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.329
 the countries of tradition begin to play 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.979
 from 4 to 6 years old here in Mexico 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.759
 there are children from 8 years of age when 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.700
 there is sub category 8 10 12 11 16 19 and 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.130
 mentor then while younger 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.979
 better as any sport you learn 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.259
 the basic techniques sooner 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.480
 younger starts playing because you can 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.400
 to have 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.580
 in a more satisfying career of 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.740
 rugby the presence of the fans is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.420
 he made present and they also shared us 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.890
 your experiences with this particular 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.590
 sport 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.760
 sport is very similar to football 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.230
 American except that it is lighter 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.000
 sports to the requirements of 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 One wing uniforms are very low 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.990
 you can practically play with the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.640
 uniform of one of a soccer team 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:28.140
 soccer, however, she 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.140
 physical demand is greater 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.370
 he is very father we have more equipment 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.790
 and the final result of the match was 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.500
 61 to 3 in favor of the team of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.080
 hammerheads of cancún 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.730
