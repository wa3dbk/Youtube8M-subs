00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
when we're out on about different
ingredients<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:25.260> over<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> past<00:00:25.920> two

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
ingredients I think over the past two

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.320 
ingredients I think over the past two
and<00:00:26.310> half<00:00:26.460> years<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.789> definitely<00:00:26.970> learned

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and half years I've definitely learned

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240 
and half years I've definitely learned
to<00:00:27.750> let<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.199> few<00:00:28.410> things<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.160> will

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
to let go of a few things and that will

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
to let go of a few things and that will
give<00:00:29.369> me<00:00:29.400> time<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.939> take<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.539> other<00:00:30.810> things

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
give me time to take on other things

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
give me time to take on other things
that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> need<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.500> need<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
that I need to need to do I think the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
that I need to need to do I think the
biggest<00:00:33.270> change<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> looking<00:00:34.590> off<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
biggest change for me is looking off of

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.410 
biggest change for me is looking off of
the<00:00:35.040> team<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.640> young<00:00:35.790> team<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.239> take<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the team it's a young team they take a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
the team it's a young team they take a
lot<00:00:36.630> nurturing<00:00:37.110> there's<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:37.559> great<00:00:37.739> guys<00:00:37.950> in

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
lot nurturing there's some great guys in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.500 
lot nurturing there's some great guys in
there<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:38.579> need<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.059> guided<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
there but they need to be guided in the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.130 
there but they need to be guided in the
right<00:00:39.629> direction

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
right direction

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.530 
right direction
and<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.829> they're<00:00:41.250> happy<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.969> track<00:00:42.270> then

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and if they're happy and on track then

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.819 
and if they're happy and on track then
then<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> food's<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.770> in

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
then I know the food's here you go in

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
then I know the food's here you go in
the<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:43.980> direction<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> food

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the right direction and I think the food

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
the right direction and I think the food
style<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:46.829> variable<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.520> think

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
style here is pretty variable I think

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
style here is pretty variable I think
we're<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.270> led<00:00:48.690> by<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.440> ingredients

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
we're just really led by the ingredients

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.549 
we're just really led by the ingredients
we<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> inspiration

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
we have and we take a lot of inspiration

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
we have and we take a lot of inspiration
from<00:00:52.890> Europe<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.610> well<00:00:53.760> ingredient<00:00:54.480> wise<00:00:54.629> as
