 it is 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.220
 eight years after his last evolution the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 legendary honda vfr 800 suffered two 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.820
 notable aesthetic changes and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.170
 techniques in order to maintain its status

 sport gt reference 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.000
 first mission the hunt for weight la 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.649
 vfr lost 10 kilos in all we know in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.539
 abandoning the double exhaust under the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.309
 saddle to regain its lateral level 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.519
 while the back loop now 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.140
 in aluminum weighs two pounds less than one 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.729
 regime that allowed the line of his 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 born girl for a stylish design 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.090
 neoclassical raised by LEDs to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.170
 front and rear optics and employment 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.800
 the blinkers migrate into the

 wing mirror 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.610
 she receives a standard anti-skating 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.930
 heated handles a hood of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.580
 saddle and a return system 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.040
 automatic turn signals and sees himself

 propose a quick shift in option she 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.369
 also wants to be more comfortable thanks to 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 half handlebars raised and a room 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.759
 in two parts refined and adjustable on 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.500
 two positions 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.820
 the more modern dashboard receives 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 including a report indicator 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090
 engaged 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.400
 the aluminum double beam frame 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.020
 remains unchanged but we note a new 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.730
 arm also believe in me adjustable in 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.190
 preload and relaxation through a 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.560
 wheel deported a new fork of 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.450
 43 mm always standard but adjustable in 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.520
 preloading new brake calipers 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.500
 before 4 radially mounted piston

 pistons in the back always with abs from 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.660
 series and new rims in 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.660
 aluminum with 10 branches 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.370
 always imperial road holding 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.200
 gains precision without penalizing the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.090
 comfort thanks to a high damping of 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.560
 range increased maneuverability in the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.970
 concatenations thanks to weight loss 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.129
 and the lowering of the center of gravity 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.840
 is a braking system that combines 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.590
 power and perfect feeling for a 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.390
 precise dosing 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.159
 the new fork is great for

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.760
 valves have been modified to offer

 even more the really low and

 progressivity of its transition phase 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 the sensation of kicking the buttocks 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.209

 100 euros compared to that of the
