00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.280
 Hello dear 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.459
 regular visitors of ours with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.279
 have already learned xenophontov Sergey 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.830
 Valerievich he told us about 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.450
 planting grapes and now we took off 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.140
 video about summer care 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.779
 grapes 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.630
 And now we will talk about feeding 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.119
 shortly to us he was told about 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.829
 how can you do it now for us 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.530
 practice Sergei Valerievich 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.899
 it will show yes how to properly 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 feed what you said notch 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.519
 need to do to the roots all well 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.280
 look here grapevine like I already 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.370
 said a piece of four lies in order 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.010
 to create additional sexual background 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.769
 Here I am a bush, he is pretty so 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 normally processed though here you can 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.920
 These lower leaves are also removed, and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.140
 here you can see already gone ovary 1 here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.979
 move the ovary 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.700
 that is, it needs to be fed a little 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.140
 top dressing is usually done in June, but in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.390
 early July continue to feed 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.880
 it is undesirable to feed 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.320
 complex fertilizers 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 top list fertilizer any can it and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.759
 ammophos to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 and kemer and here in this case some 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.909
 me this skype bout my fertilizer up 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.259
 search or can be liquid to birds 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.130
 fertilizers if liquid complex 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.049
 fertilizer 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.719
 which is sold in large bottles 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.420
 bird's there video of another dung or 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.520
 chemical fertilizer that agree with 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.609
 ducts taken are dissolved in such a tape 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.090
 let's say it and shed how to do it 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:58.229
 I 'll tell you right now on the example of dry 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.939
 fertilizers here we remove the slate from here and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.189
 like a bush seat 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.200
 But centimeters until 2030 can be a little 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.579
 more 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.649
 pass in the hole here or a crowbar or 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.540
 Here in this case I have such a pond 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.690
 methodically that's somewhere to a depth of 30 40 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.599
 centimeters no longer need to break through 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.769
 fragments one second here it is possible blocks 34 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:29.060
 like that . it turned out further we take it 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:36.349
 time we pour this fertilizer right in 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.000
 well because the walkie talkie can 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.819
 make a big can happen 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.299
 burn after this pour into this hole 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:52.340
 water here we find in the department to leave more 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.739
 rush yes yes yes if the weather is dry then 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.720
 goes well new here just yesterday 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.880
 there were big downpours here visible land 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:11.900
 raw so see water goes bad 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 piled up yes yes you can and immediately 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.780
 fill because nothing terrible 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.819
 It will be away 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.620
 escape just does not go mini also remove not 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.180
 desired with training 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.260
 Means here for such a bush you say 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.620
 4 buns up to 2 4 holes in diameter and so 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.640
 to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.410
 from the roots by the way method principle so grade 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.560
 it is possible to do more how to make bows and then 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.730
 these cuts just close so the water doesn't 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:55.080
 evaporated to leave, in principle, the whole 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:59.310
 how many such platforms can you make 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.740
 one two fertilizing since may 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.660
 when they start to feed 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.260
 then somewhere at the end again 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.550
 repeat here we have the end of june like 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.190
 not enough, I think enough 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.540
 otherwise there will be an active growth of green mass. 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.760
 and to the detriment of maturation 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.370
 so we also wanted to tell you about the contract 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.810
 about the garter here you see here with me 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.900
 here are some already tied up and here it is he 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.270
 I caught myself doing it just like that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.180
 that's when he walks past the village just 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.920
 you take this time its hooked knot 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.720
 knotted broke us knotted it 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.350
 sort of like he grabbed on 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.080
 will go this way in a knot tied up 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.960
 so he went on 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:54.840
 but as the best course to take the wire here 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.330
 the wire comes off and that's it 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.950
 way supported shelf 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.500
 tie even better because we 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.240
 Immediately form as says that all 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.150
 each twig was sold 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.830
 defendants are a containment balloon because 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.900
 if that's like a tof heap to form 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.550
 then see here it turns out and clusters 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.550
 hang they will shade long 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.080
 and the next moment is a bunch 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.669
 began to fill need to remove leaves 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.710
 I will not remove the uterus here because 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:29.159
 it's okay here I will tell you on 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.900
 Next let the grapes and this is 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.449
 four years four years 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:39.889
 here you all tassel here leave it 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:42.509
 in general, then he is basically 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.120
 recommended depending on the variety 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.520
 leave here on one vine no more 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.159
 one bunch action grams by 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.529
 600 such large if clusters of grams 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.990
 200 300 it is possible to leave the likeness 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.919
 in this case in my opinion it is now we 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.889
 let's see yes it is 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:05.909
 elegant large-fruited bunch and 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:08.840
 very big here on the runaway 2 milk mushrooms or 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:11.699
 here here here we see 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.150
 here on this shoots 2 ship here one 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.090
 bunch 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:19.080
 weak we worsened them and and delete 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.440
 pruner I was here well here and secateurs 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.580
 aquarius and and leave one 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.250
 then it will be better better here I 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.740
 created two clusters why because here 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.229
 here on the other side of the bush on the same 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:39.509
 there is no escape of grapes 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:45.960
 1 2 3 4 5 here practically I left 1 2 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:51.419
 3 4 that is, it turned out that the load 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:57.180
 balanced and when children in georgia 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:07:00.810
 will fill up means we already when they 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.539
 there will be already a commercial size chicken 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:08.689
 product taste and appearance there still 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:09.960
 immature we then retreat to 68 and 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:12.089
 leaflets and 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.990
 this is a prune we need to tell off 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:18.330
 I 'll tell you about us next 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.180
 We are looking for a bush where this big pain is here 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.760
 berry well ok then we let's we with 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.100
 interrupt you and ask gardeners not 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.870
 go at hand over from our site and we 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.870
 tell you about other grapes
