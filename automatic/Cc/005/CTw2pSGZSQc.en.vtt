00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.850
 little face again to be the father and the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.050
 sister as you can see here is 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.000
 I asked them to send me 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.800
 twitter or by facebook questions that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.820
 what happens in what they have done the one 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.189
 side is what you liked most in villada 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
 took to the work of the dry because I do not know 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.030
 some as well as the best gift because 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.380
 Antonio spends doing get me 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.420
 all the time you have to look at this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
 place I give it to you and look at this portal 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.100
 portraits and so I like very much the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.220
 balls would you like to have another sister to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.380
 my 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.080
 Doctors really like the truth 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.380
 well that's what they like the most 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.380
 of the other 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 and what I like most is very pretty 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.900
 and it 's super super super loving if it's so 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.960
 love that today have been given or have given 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.330
 with the same guy, not taking in 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.980
 account that my sister is 10 years old 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.410
 I think there is a way for that to happen 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.500
 soon things that bother you the one of 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.280
 the other that when he gets angry and yells at me and 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.280
 then my aunt 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.720
 it's very exasperating a little bit like that to me 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.360
 Sometimes it bothers me when you grab my 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.080
 things and less you return them to their place or 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.510
 Sometimes you are very very intimate of very intense 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.970
 and it can become too much fight 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.620
 followed then has not been fights fights 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.730
 fights not but suddenly if it bothered her 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.650
 a lot and gets angry is she as angry 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.650
 who they think is mom's darling 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.680
 because they like to do together because to me 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.329
 I like it a lot later like being in my 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.189
 fourth sometimes each making a 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.350
 different thing but how to be together in 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.509
 Generally I like to play him 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.630
 Tickle 7 and what do I find most 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.069
 like what the monster is and spread out 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.959
 throughout the house they have good 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.599
 communication I think so, because 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.300
 When we do not like something, we do not like it 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.760
 we say if we do not have like this kind of 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.130
 problem what did you think when I made a 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.180
 implement act too much 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.660
 temptation to stable mention and my 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.720
 first tattoo she designed it and she had 5 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.849
 aÃ±itos who think of their boyfriends think 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 Well now I do not have a boyfriend but 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.210
 I had 2 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.730
 funny antonio's boyfriend I kept quiet 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.210
 come very well we do not live together much but 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.900
 He is very cute and playful producer and how 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.050
 catalog your normal relationship great more 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.510
 or less well or we like, I think 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.810
 which is great when they are years old 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.030
 antonia meets on June 3 8 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.780
 July this year they take them took 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.000
 exactly 9 years and 11 months or 10 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.250
 years and I would like to make communion and I 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.020
 I would like very much to be like my brother who 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.240
 I felt when I knew I was going to have a 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.040
 sister, father, I remember I was 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.810
 very excited gives a little bit of fear 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.690
 like my mom was the one to see more 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.120
 that to me but then not in the end 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.610
 better stick together because we have never 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.980
 gone out of age but I remember 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.260
 once antonio was very very very little 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.730
 and there was like a family meal and already 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.300
 we had left a glass of wine in the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.130
 floor 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.770
 jermaine returned the wine glass 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.610
 it was empty she was sitting 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.310
 smiling 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.140
 good these soon the questions and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.810

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.190
