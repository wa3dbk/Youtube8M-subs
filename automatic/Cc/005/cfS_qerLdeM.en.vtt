 prebase for eyelids in this case I will 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.100
 this brown tone that I have here 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.760
 to apply it gently 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.830
 As you can see it is a soft brown 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.010
 and I want to tell you that I'm luque is very 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:41.030
 very fresh very spring and highlights 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.890
 much the clear eyes or that the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.290
 girls who have clear eyes go on 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.120
 advantage with this makeup because of 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.760
 true that makes them stand out above all 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.480
 the green eyes pairs of see see dike and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.720

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.370
 take the midnight tone 15 and I'll 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.329
 apply as follows 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.500
 simply at the beginning of the eye 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 and I'm going to try to spread it very well 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.800
 just to give it here in the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 entry 1 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.700
 highlight 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.940
 which on both sides has to remain and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:39.020
 and I'm going to apply it here as strength to go 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.020
 applying inward 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 a broader brush 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 a little bit because of those excesses of clear shadow 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.440
 that I have placed 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.330
 at the same time 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.330
 you though a dark shadow 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.420
 everything as the tint of the palette can 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.530
 take a little bit and do it on the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.790
 basin and banana eye soft color 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.790
 of Transition 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.400
 for a pin tip type brush I will 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.590
 take the tone and see what is this bronze 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.069
 of the palette and I will draw it by the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.370
 eyelash line 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.370
 up here 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.810
 of travel 24/7 is point not so 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.290
 so you can see and I'm going to take the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.280
 water line to delineate a line of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.280
 water with this tone 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.620
 ah 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.900
 and give it to put it here we put it in 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.270
 the center of the eyelid trying to make the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.510
 itself is incorporated and that merges with 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.300
 the other tones so much this one that is here 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.700
 at the beginning as with this other that is 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.660
 darker 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.540
 this afternoon I know 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.700
 here in the center grouped and that 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.890
 locate 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.709
 in an equitable manner and treat very well 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.500
 try not to take much amount now 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.950
 I'm going to take a little illuminator with 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.610
 this brush that is the 46 of the kit 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.610
 precisions 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.870
 a little the previous tone 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.520
 Y 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.690
 a little 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.790
 the dallas and I like it very much for 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.790
 contour 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.600
 We can before applying the mask 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.940
 we can reinforce the pencil that is a 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.639
 applied and purple so that makeup 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.919
 look even more powerful and now I'm going to 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.460
 use a mask that I love that 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.900
 is that it's called crazy volume mask already 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.669
 I have put a little lipstick 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.669
 but I'm going to apply the mask 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.919
 we put on a mask too 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.919
 here below 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.740
 and what is the snow theme that is doing very well 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:38.259
 to this makeup to my understanding now 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.580
 well it's a muted option and it makes the 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:45.759
 look of the eyes highlight much more this 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.929
 it is the time it looks also very nice 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:53.020
 I am this is almost as a last option 

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:54.699
 of lipstick can I recommend this 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.099
 what I love is the colors 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:01.059
 mailing sensation in this case the 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.039
 number 65 silly fascinates me is a tone 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.709
 that is not a bit so scandalous is 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.749
 more settled than the previous one that 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:10.330
 I showed or that the previous ones and good 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.349
 I wear on my nails or today I asked 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.490
 forever 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:19.569
 the tone 112 and if it is a wonderful color 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.629
 good spring is beautiful in this 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.939
 nail sticker have a good wine that 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.949

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.789

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:37.169
 and nothing will be until the next time 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.169
