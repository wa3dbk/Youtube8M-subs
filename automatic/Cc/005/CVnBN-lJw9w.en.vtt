00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 power was also a rifle a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.690
 easy recipe right 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 in the French Alps to be more 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 specific one of my favorites in the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 truth still existing because I like 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 very very much this recipe calls 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 called what else is simplifying 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.360
 that the mashed potato with cheese tim but 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.579
 come on have some specs 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.790
 first we are using potatoes 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 asterix the asterix potato it is drier 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 so she left me her power is very 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.579
 expected because it 's interesting that you 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
 will put cheese so it does not give much 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.760
 alloy ensures you have the guard then 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.129
 people are using this potato that she 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 Have a rosy box so it's difficult to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.890
 meet 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.660
 How do we put it on? 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 cook it off with the box 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.410
 whole without drilling without cutting 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.769
 It takes a little longer delay plus a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.930
 little but worth it because you do not 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.490
 put a lot of water in it that's no use going 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.060
 cook faster you get 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.070
 to peel a snack 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 When will it be the same then do it? 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.330
 that does not weigh you very hot and you 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.490
 She cooks until her house started to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.140
 give a relaxing time there, what's hot? 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.409
 yet you take a cloth for you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 help and with a little knife but only 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.110
 pulling it out it will come out the shell 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.000
 does not work is easy and has to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 peal because it indicates that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.329
 only too much liquid later you would put 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.220
 a lot more cream than we do 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 will now use what you put when 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.689
 she is hot and she will practice it here in a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.810
 childhood does not seek and will do or for 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.829
 he and knead the potatoes 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.360
 here we are with a pitcher and 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.890
 good actually there are those more 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.810
 that you tighten type of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.479
 potato suppliers do not make changes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.670
 He needs to be well tied up. 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.790
 stabilizes you can not actually invite 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.880
 so first you mass them just to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.280
 potato is in the cream is going after 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 Our poet is well tied here 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.330
 The flu is already creamy already. 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.760
 But now we're going to add the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.290
 our special ingredients such as 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.410
 People said it's a mashed potato with 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.360
 cheese, the original cheese is gol me 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.420
 savoy tome which is a milk cheese 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.610
 of cow then it is a cheese 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 had I remembered that they multiplied it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.420
 It is a cheese with a marked taste and it is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.470
 half clumsy he reminds me a little 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.570
 Awareness about this here is a bit 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.420
 more dry and it has a cone and 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.600
 back too so darker but we 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.160
 Let's burn it here. Let's use mines. 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.080
 standard and beat is to taste a fol 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.030
 a little stronger than the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.090
 original is already placing obliging 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.220
 It's also good that I get it now, come on, cheese. 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 mines and oboe so well spoken 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 to melt well and will put 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.620
 the fresh cream to give texture 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.600
 right outside we warmed up here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.940
 the sour cream just to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.340
 facilitate people will put will 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.500
 mix much more and stir well until it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.050
 dissolve what he said for much more 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.080
 creamy and you will put the cheeses 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.080
 After that we'll add 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.390
 we are gradually putting 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.790
 same proportion the two cheeses a little 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.610
 of each nÃ© stirring always placed 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.260
 the cheeses does not stop tinkering with our 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.780
 Tongue is ready delicious with certainty 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.880
 and pt tried to do something that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.580
 even though I do not understand 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.739
 I said this and until he got a 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:03.730
 kiss is not if the spoon slap serve 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:08.220
 To kiss woman were 1 with a 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.920
 protein with it that is not little 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.500
