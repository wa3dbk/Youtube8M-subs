musicians<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.650> all-star<00:02:32.890> orchestra

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
musicians in this all-star orchestra

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.420 
musicians in this all-star orchestra
with<00:02:34.360> incredibly<00:02:35.170> careful<00:02:35.530> bowing<00:02:36.130> and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
with incredibly careful bowing and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.660 
with incredibly careful bowing and
vibrato<00:02:37.410> choices<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.890> way<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.519> these

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
vibrato choices and the way that these

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.830 
vibrato choices and the way that these
harmonies<00:02:40.150> are<00:02:41.070> voiced<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:43.030> piece<00:02:43.239> in<00:02:43.540> some

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
harmonies are voiced the piece in some

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.470 
harmonies are voiced the piece in some
ways<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:45.130> very<00:02:45.370> simple<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.910> elegant<00:02:46.150> but

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
ways is it's very simple and elegant but

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.060 
ways is it's very simple and elegant but
on<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> other<00:02:46.840> hand<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.140> builds<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.709> these

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
on the other hand it builds up to these

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.850 
on the other hand it builds up to these
rich<00:02:48.519> harmonic<00:02:49.090> fields<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:50.110> kind<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.560> melt

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
rich harmonic fields that kind of melt

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.190 
rich harmonic fields that kind of melt
and<00:02:51.190> re-emerge<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.660> things<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:53.049> this

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and re-emerge and and things of this

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.030 
and re-emerge and and things of this
kind<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:55.299> way<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:55.989> plays<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.860> is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
kind and the way that one plays that is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.280 
kind and the way that one plays that is
very<00:02:57.400> important<00:02:58.030> on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.329> string<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.900> think

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
very important on the string I think

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.050 
very important on the string I think
another<00:02:59.500> characteristic<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> piece<00:03:00.820> is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
another characteristic of the piece is

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.630 
another characteristic of the piece is
that<00:03:01.239> it's<00:03:01.470> relatively<00:03:02.470> high<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.220> register

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
that it's relatively high in register

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.340 
that it's relatively high in register
it's<00:03:03.790> moving<00:03:04.150> up<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.420> that's<00:03:04.660> why<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:04.930> image

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
it's moving up and that's why this image

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.960 
it's moving up and that's why this image
of<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.709> paradise<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.489> light<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.850> we're

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
of of paradise and light that we're

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.140 
of of paradise and light that we're
moving<00:03:07.239> towards<00:03:07.930> some<00:03:08.170> other<00:03:08.769> other<00:03:09.400> world<00:03:09.879> or

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
moving towards some other other world or

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.820 
moving towards some other other world or
other<00:03:10.270> place<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
other place and I think that the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.320 
other place and I think that the
technique<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.430> playing<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.120> something

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
technique of playing it is something

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.760 
technique of playing it is something
that<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.750> audience<00:03:13.900> would<00:03:14.349> really

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
that the audience would really

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
that the audience would really
joy<00:03:15.240> because<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:17.440> very<00:03:17.860> simple<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
joy because it it it's very simple and

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.420 
joy because it it it's very simple and
therefore<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.360> becomes<00:03:19.630> very<00:03:19.960> hard<00:03:20.430> there's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
therefore it becomes very hard there's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.050 
therefore it becomes very hard there's
no<00:03:22.140> makeup<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.710> piece<00:03:23.920> at<00:03:24.190> all<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.940> just

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
no makeup in this piece at all it's just

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:59.240 
no makeup in this piece at all it's just
pure<00:03:25.660> heart

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.369 

Augusta<00:04:00.250> read<00:04:00.370> Thomas's<00:04:00.939> of<00:04:01.120> Paradise<00:04:02.109> and

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
Augusta read Thomas's of Paradise and

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.670 
Augusta read Thomas's of Paradise and
light<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.670> short<00:04:04.180> work<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.900> it's

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
light is a short work and it's

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.050 
light is a short work and it's
interesting<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.519> way<00:04:06.670> it's<00:04:06.879> constructed

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
interesting the way it's constructed

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.059 
interesting the way it's constructed
it's<00:04:07.629> constructed<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.379> what<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.769> would<00:04:08.890> call

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
it's constructed in what I would call

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.440 
it's constructed in what I would call
gestures<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.109> a<00:04:11.140> first<00:04:11.530> gesture<00:04:12.010> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
gestures so you have a first gesture and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.990 
gestures so you have a first gesture and
then<00:04:13.450> there's<00:04:13.689> a<00:04:13.780> stop<00:04:14.049> this<00:04:14.409> is<00:04:14.530> an<00:04:14.590> actual

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
then there's a stop this is an actual

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.699 
then there's a stop this is an actual
Fermata<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.479> then<00:04:16.900> there's<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.199> moment<00:04:17.380> of

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
Fermata and then there's a moment of

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.340 
Fermata and then there's a moment of
pause<00:04:17.919> it's<00:04:18.729> not<00:04:18.970> an<00:04:19.209> arbitrary<00:04:19.539> moment<00:04:20.259> of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
pause it's not an arbitrary moment of

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.290 
pause it's not an arbitrary moment of
pause<00:04:20.500> she<00:04:20.739> actually<00:04:20.889> writes<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:21.850> then

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
pause she actually writes that and then

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.689 
pause she actually writes that and then
there's<00:04:22.509> another<00:04:22.960> gesture<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.830> then<00:04:24.520> there's

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
there's another gesture and then there's

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.909 
there's another gesture and then there's
another<00:04:24.910> moment<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.330> pause<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.990> then<00:04:26.650> another

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
another moment of pause and then another

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.820 
another moment of pause and then another
gesture<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:28.240> continues<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.110> way<00:04:29.350> at

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
gesture and it continues in that way at

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.499 
gesture and it continues in that way at
the<00:04:30.639> same<00:04:30.849> time<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.810> does<00:04:32.470> feel<00:04:32.889> unified<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
the same time it does feel unified the

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.010 
the same time it does feel unified the
language<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.550> consistent<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.449> material

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
language is consistent the material

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.140 
language is consistent the material
isn't<00:04:38.199> really<00:04:38.590> repeated<00:04:39.160> it's<00:04:39.789> just

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
isn't really repeated it's just

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.450 
isn't really repeated it's just
developed<00:04:40.720> constantly<00:04:41.349> I<00:04:41.590> think<00:04:42.070> part<00:04:42.310> of<00:04:42.370> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
developed constantly I think part of the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.430 
developed constantly I think part of the
reason<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.970> because<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.750> tempo<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.229> pretty

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
reason is because the tempo is pretty

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.560 
reason is because the tempo is pretty
much<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.740> same<00:04:44.919> throughout<00:04:45.250> yes<00:04:45.940> some<00:04:46.210> little

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
much the same throughout yes some little

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.350 
much the same throughout yes some little
faster<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> little<00:04:47.139> slower<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.849> color<00:04:49.120> of

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
faster a little slower it the color of

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.350 
faster a little slower it the color of
the<00:04:49.449> orchestra<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.139> just<00:04:50.590> those<00:04:50.910> two<00:04:51.910> violins

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
the orchestra is just those two violins

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.800 
the orchestra is just those two violins
viola<00:04:52.990> cello<00:04:53.430> with<00:04:54.430> doublings<00:04:55.300> obviously

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
viola cello with doublings obviously

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.480 
viola cello with doublings obviously
there<00:04:56.320> there<00:04:56.830> aren't<00:04:57.009> woodwinds<00:04:57.400> brass

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
there there aren't woodwinds brass

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.460 
there there aren't woodwinds brass
there's<00:04:57.940> no<00:04:58.060> double<00:04:58.419> basses<00:04:58.780> no<00:04:58.930> percussion

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
there's no double basses no percussion

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.420 
there's no double basses no percussion
it<00:05:00.070> helps<00:05:00.789> us<00:05:01.260> see<00:05:02.260> this<00:05:02.470> work<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:02.949> unified

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
it helps us see this work as a unified

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.170 
it helps us see this work as a unified
whole<00:05:03.460> because<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.630> color<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.320> very<00:05:05.530> much

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
whole because the color is very much

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.320 
whole because the color is very much
consistent<00:05:07.180> throughout<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:08.310> she<00:05:09.310> uses<00:05:10.120> these

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
consistent throughout and she uses these
