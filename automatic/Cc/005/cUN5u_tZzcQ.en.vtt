00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.470
 during the Leiden introduction week for students, that is a coincidence 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.590
 meeting you 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.939
 get to know the city 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.489
 and another ship 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.619
 on the second day of the year 2011 whether this was the case 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.950
 the students were introduced to integrity 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.590
 PSV was disappointing 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.470
 but also with the city that happened from the water 50 numerous measures that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.339
 was opened by the second half of 2010 for students 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.339
 the leader 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.330
 7 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.040
 after a collision in Arnhem and and there we go again 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.110
 balkenende 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.999
 by me 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.300
 Windows 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.800
 to that 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 more than a year ago 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.580
 Is that right 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 psv now we have to with this game 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 news 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.750
 the new Year 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.600
 per day 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 were in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
 all 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
 the farmer 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.050
 only from this program 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.290
 after his replacement top woman 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 now a good impression 9 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.850
 there will also be a fun one but you will also be overboard in production 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.800
 of course that is not very yes then again 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.860
 yes I feel it is a good idea to include projects 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.280
 because it's nice to know 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.000
 failed evacuation 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.750
 I get you anyway that it plays a good person but yes it is difficult 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.579
 to 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.939
 lost everything to the many new ones there 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.129
 I have a lot of understanding and learning new things 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 also and that this spring the 14th game is still going on 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.329
 refuse 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.329
 we have 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.209
 that also appears to be a thirteenth time down 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 I do 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:39.969
 ioc 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:45.149
 It seems like the era is coming to an end, and that financial year is coming 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.229
 let us know that poverty works can no longer use yes that had too 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.920
 make another version provocative and that has the circle of friends 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.539
 gets refused for that reason 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:57.299
 further on
