00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
well built but the main problem going to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
well built but the main problem going to
have<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.430> throughout<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.299> away<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
have this throughout you right away is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
have this throughout you right away is
that<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> heavy<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.070> about<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that it is heavy it's about it's about a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.390 
that it is heavy it's about it's about a
two<00:01:33.060> pound<00:01:33.210> lens<00:01:33.509> about<00:01:33.689> thirty<00:01:34.079> 33<00:01:35.040> ounces

this is what you got so basically you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.469 
this is what you got so basically you

know quick rundown is the if' the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
know quick rundown is the if' the
internal<00:01:45.840> focusing<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> middle<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
of the motor of the middle of the lens

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.370 
of the motor of the middle of the lens
moves<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.909> AFS<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> auto<00:01:52.200> focus

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
moves and it has the AFS the auto focus

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.889 
moves and it has the AFS the auto focus
silent<00:01:52.979> motor<00:01:53.149> which<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.329> actually<00:01:54.750> pretty

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
silent motor which is actually pretty

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.280 
silent motor which is actually pretty
silent<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.060> made<00:01:57.210> in

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
silent for what it is this was made in

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.770 
silent for what it is this was made in
1997<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.710> our<00:01:58.860> 1999<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.820> discontinued

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
1997 and with our 1999 and discontinued

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.490 
1997 and with our 1999 and discontinued
in<00:02:00.930> 2007<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.640> an<00:02:03.509> older<00:02:03.810> lens<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.320> it's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
in 2007 so it's an older lens but it's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.389 
in 2007 so it's an older lens but it's
great<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:04.920> only<00:02:05.040> about<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.280> hundred

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
great there was only about a hundred

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.300 
great there was only about a hundred
thirty<00:02:05.939> thousand<00:02:06.719> made<00:02:06.899> by<00:02:07.110> Nikon<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> guess

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
thirty thousand made by Nikon so I guess

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.850 
thirty thousand made by Nikon so I guess
this<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.940> rare<00:02:09.239> commodity<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:10.619> not

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
this is of a rare commodity but not

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.100 
this is of a rare commodity but not
really<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.550> also<00:02:11.730> has<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> IDI<00:02:12.690> which<00:02:12.930> I'll

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
really it also has the IDI which I'll

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
really it also has the IDI which I'll
say<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> box<00:02:13.590> on

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
say on the box on

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
say on the box on
it's<00:02:14.700> basically<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.360> extra<00:02:15.900> low<00:02:16.050> dispersion

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it's basically the extra low dispersion

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's basically the extra low dispersion
which<00:02:16.800> helps<00:02:17.069> with<00:02:17.160> chromatic<00:02:17.690> aberration

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
which helps with chromatic aberration

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.240 
which helps with chromatic aberration
and<00:02:18.900> colors<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.380> everything<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:19.890> when

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
and colors and everything like that when

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.400 
and colors and everything like that when
you<00:02:20.370> start<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.730> magnify<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.080> lot<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.350> you

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
you start to magnify in a lot so you

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.900 
you start to magnify in a lot so you
don't<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.740> purple<00:02:23.069> or<00:02:23.340> green<00:02:23.730> around

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
don't see the purple or green around

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.970 
don't see the purple or green around
some<00:02:24.450> lines<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.110> more<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> full<00:02:25.709> frame

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
some lines this is more of a full frame

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.270 
some lines this is more of a full frame
camera<00:02:26.040> 35<00:02:26.850> millimeter<00:02:27.420> lens<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.319> has<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.470> motor

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
camera 35 millimeter lens it has a motor

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.060 
camera 35 millimeter lens it has a motor
in<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> which<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:29.880> great<00:02:30.330> for<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.720> technology

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
in it which is great for the technology

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.920 
in it which is great for the technology
it<00:02:32.070> has<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.580> think<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.910> off<00:02:33.060> 15<00:02:33.390> elements<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
it has I think it's off 15 elements and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.030 
it has I think it's off 15 elements and
11<00:02:34.290> groups<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.800> 9<00:02:35.430> blades<00:02:35.880> F<00:02:36.240> 2.8<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.440> an<00:02:37.560> f-22

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
11 groups and 9 blades F 2.8 to an f-22

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.130 
11 groups and 9 blades F 2.8 to an f-22
so<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.209> great<00:02:39.450> overall<00:02:39.780> lens

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
so it's a great overall lens

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.979 
so it's a great overall lens
professional<00:02:40.950> lens<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.850> extremely<00:02:42.390> popular

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it also has if you can see here the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.640 
it also has if you can see here the
aperture<00:02:45.270> ring<00:02:45.300> which<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.170> great<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.530> you're

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
aperture ring which is great if you're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
pop it up to the highest one and set it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.270 
pop it up to the highest one and set it
slightly<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.080> use<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:04.440> others<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.100> cut

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
slightly you can use with others and cut

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.880 
slightly you can use with others and cut
more<00:03:05.430> quick<00:03:05.640> things<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.660> focus<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.260> one

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
more quick things it can focus up to one

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.630 
more quick things it can focus up to one
and<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.040> half<00:03:08.160> feet

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and a half feet

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.820 
and a half feet
that's<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.180> 0.5<00:03:09.720> meters<00:03:10.140> pretty<00:03:10.560> that's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
that's about 0.5 meters pretty that's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.110 
that's about 0.5 meters pretty that's
actually<00:03:11.100> really<00:03:11.280> great<00:03:11.430> really<00:03:11.580> close<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
actually really great really close I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.690 
actually really great really close I
wound<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.080> 70<00:03:13.530> meters<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:13.950> works<00:03:14.489> really

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
wound in to 70 meters so works really

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.220 
wound in to 70 meters so works really
well<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.150> necessarily<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.630> macro<00:03:16.019> lens

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
well it's not necessarily a macro lens

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.800 
well it's not necessarily a macro lens
but<00:03:16.860> it'll<00:03:17.220> do<00:03:17.370> exactly<00:03:17.850> what<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.120> need<00:03:18.329> off

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
but it'll do exactly what you need off

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.479 
but it'll do exactly what you need off
of<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.079> most<00:03:19.260> part<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.560> don't<00:03:19.709> expect<00:03:19.829> macro

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
of the most part so don't expect macro

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.910 
of the most part so don't expect macro
work<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.660> once<00:03:21.900> again<00:03:22.019> at<00:03:22.380> 28

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
work with it but once again at 28
