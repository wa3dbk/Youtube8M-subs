00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.380
 this is the range rover evoque does not have 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.930
 need so many presentations like it for 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.759
 the sexy and attractive line for quality 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.619
 of the interior furnishings for the change 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.860
 nine-speed automatic but also for 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:17.110
 the ability to get by in off-road vehicles 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:26.320
 in short, the queen of the compact suvs of 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:28.060
 luxury and she is true at least until now 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.930
 andrea chose the range rover evoque 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.670
 but it happens to me that it was wanted 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.489
 enter the segment and created from 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.379
 x4 the little sister of the ic you're here 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.420
 however the real places are five but 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.960
 above the bonnet there is a 3000 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.030
 258 hp turbodiesel far more than 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.999
 what Andrea can boast of for 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.149
 me a compact suv so sporty not 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.149
 there is 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.960
 well sorry but if we talk about sportsmanship 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.180
 this wins over all is makan s strength 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.910
 diesel may be less powerful than the bmw 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 but as you drive in the street you don't 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.210
 something for nobody 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.360
 and since we have three divers we have 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.580
 decided to upload them with something that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.650
 surely everyone will have a home 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.650
 very heavy electric scooter 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 of the three the region revokes the most 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.970
 baby about 30 cm long in 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.210
 unless they dance compared to their rivals yes 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.310
 they feel it is useless to deny it both in life 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.510
 flexibility that is not exceptional for a 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.480
 nonsense literature both in the guide on 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.520
 road, however, I want to gain 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.800
 shell in city traffic is not 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.250
 at least complicated after all 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.620
 taken measurements to the bodywork when 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.170
 x4 and makan will still be searching 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.420
 parking you will already be sitting at the bar a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.900
 enjoy a delicious cup dinghisti 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.690
 thanks to the more compact measures of the other 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.820
 singing when you leave the walls you can 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.830
 rely on a rather sharp steering 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.880
 a trim that does not look good 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.770
 body roll is a truly Gallardo engine 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.030
 accomplices 190 horses and tomatic change 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.830
 nine reports 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.459
 the shot at the traffic light of this diesel e 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.440
 almost that of the centometrist even though 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.780
 not comparable to the six 3- cylinder 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.730
 liters of opponents decidedly more 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.709
 continuous 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.930
 good for consumption for the price 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.860
 nailed well below the figures 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.930
 fixed by vmv and porsche 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.049
 last but not least the capacity of 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.489
 get by when the asphalt ends 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.480
 thanks to the terrain response e mix 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.370
 all - wheel drive 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.709
 the pitchers will feel at ease on the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.709
 Sardinian beaches as in the curtain weekend 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.480
 the x4 is in fact the sports car 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.910
 of the x3 with respect to which it has one 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.280
 driving position lower than 20 mm 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.860
 while maintaining the luxury of the five seats 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.590
 it is not original or extrovert like 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.480
 the Ebola makan but offers the driver the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.040
 solidity typical of all BMWs 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.080
 inside get confused with a 3 series 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.200
 it's very easy 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.860
 the engine then is a true marvel the 3000 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.080
 six-cylinder turbodiesel is capable of 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580
 258 horses ready as soon as the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.590
 gas 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.200
 no uncertainty delay the push is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.910
 immediately consistent helped by the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.340
 change to eight reports very well 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.870
 spaced and all-wheel drive 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.820
 unstoppable consumption is negligible 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.990
 going fast, they are just over 6 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.550
 liters per 100 km 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.990
 all this does not mean 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.510
 giving up comfort 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.060
 anything but the suv coupe of Monaco e 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.100
 silent even at high speeds such as 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.830
 the best of the red arrow is a 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.650
 spacious trunk and rational 500 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.260
 liters only 50 less than the x3 e 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.800
 that become 1,500 in the event it is folded 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.690
 in the seats it does not cost little because with 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.850
 some extra accessory breaks through the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.160
 wall of the 60 thousand euros 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.170
 but don't worry if you want to keep yourself 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.180
 there are others in your pocket 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.230
 engines to choose from all of them however 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.230
 very valid 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.510
 to begin with, according to me clava 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.940
 cannes is the most beautiful of the 3 the line in 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.580
 elegant and seductive sport and for the 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.380
 opponents there is no story that is one 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.170
 the true porsche also the in 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.480
 third and true the dashboard is full of keys 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.830
 and at first perhaps disorienting 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.470
 but the quality of the materials e 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.330
 assembly is indisputable 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.250
 once seated in the other driver's seat 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.530
 easily the best location all 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.970
 I find it handy 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.530
 certainly on the habitability front 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.350
 competitors probably do 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.030
 better in front of the space there is if anything the 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.070
 problem is behind like a non access 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.280
 own wide and low roof not 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.280
 facilitate the highest but on the move that 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.430
 the lack takes the diesel from 250 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.390
 horses and as many as 500 newtonmetri of couple 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.330
 he can move almost two tons 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.150
 without the slightest uncertainty the character 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.530
 porsche comes out in acceleration 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.020
 just over six seconds to touch i 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.210
 100 per hour is an important fact e 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.280
 then there is precise steering between the 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.020
 tireless is a structure sewn to the 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.500
 perfection around the performance of the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.320
 diesel 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.780
 the more generous tires on the rear 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.240
 just like the 911 gives a great one 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.400
 feeling in the corners and the double pdk gearbox 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.080
 7-speed clutch does the rest 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.569
 to maximize the pleasure of 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.029
 guide 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.050
 at gait code instead blade kahn 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.819
 seems to stop 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.169
 the cockpit is perfectly insulated from the 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.499
 noise and control suspensions 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.969
 electronic work at least prestige 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:17.249
 has its price and to take home 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.979
 the naca ness diesel takes 61 thousand 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.199
 not few euros and if you let us take the 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.459
 hand with the optionals you really risk 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.039
 to pay her madness 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:26.759
 on the other hand, however, the consumption of cities as in 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.289
 highway 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.289
 a super in the 13 km 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.770
 and the name of charity is beautiful though is 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:57.910
 honestly my makan really goes 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:07:01.750
 common name 911 television but that 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.810
 let's watch TV beautiful for charity 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.110
 then the force beautiful meanwhile I with 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.110
 my baby
