Hi, Iâ€™m Francis,

00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:09.750
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.118
First, salt both sides of the salmon fillet

00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:26.366
and lightly pat the surface with your fingers.

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:32.625
Then, let the fillet sit for 15 minutes.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:38.371
Squeeze out the yuzu juice or any type of sour citrus juice

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.980
and pour it into a pitcher.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:46.512
Combine it with the same amount of soy sauce,

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.497
making easy homemade ponzu.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:01:00.049
Slice the long green onion into thin slices using diagonal cuts.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.184
Place a sheet of parchment paper

00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:06.469
onto a larger piece of aluminum foil.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.566
Arrange two-thirds of the long green onions

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.862
along with two-thirds of the shimeji

00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:15.129
and maitake mushrooms onto the paper.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.698
Sprinkle on the salt

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.817
and the pepper.

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.338
Add the white wine.

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:32.455
Now, with kitchen paper,

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:37.224
carefully remove the excess moisture from the surface of the fillet.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:45.144
Add the white wine, coat it evenly

00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:50.112
and place the salmon onto the mushrooms.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:56.098
Sprinkle on a generous amount of the pepper again.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:01.519
Place the rest of the long green onion

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:04.602
and the mushrooms on top.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.520
Lift both sides of the foil

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.160
and fold the edges 2 to 3 times to seal.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.917
Likewise, fold the left and right sides as shown.

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:27.768
Then, place the foil into a toaster oven.

00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:35.155
Bake the salmon for about 20 minutes.

00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:38.923
Now, it is ready to serve.

00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:44.996
With kitchen gloves, remove the foil and place it onto a plate.

00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:51.697
Unseal the foil but be careful not to burn yourself.

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:55.429
Top with the chopped spring onion leaves.

00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:59.369
Then, place the butter onto the fish.

00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:04.385
Finally, pour the ponzu sauce over the dish.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.719
The cooking time depends on the thickness of the fillet

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.029
and the type of toaster oven so adjust it accordingly.

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.687
Miso and butter go great together,

00:03:16.687 --> 00:03:21.467
so you can also season the dish like in our salmon chan chan yaki video.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:35.478
You can also use pacific cod, pollock,

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:39.646
sea bream, red snapper or marlin in this recipe.

00:03:39.646 --> 00:03:41.548
Good luck in the kitchen.
