unbreaking 3 efficiency for I believe
that<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.770> fortune<00:02:37.770> three<00:02:38.130> Wow<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.800 
that is and fortune three Wow there is a
lot<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.770> with<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.130> pic<00:02:41.490> now<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.120> was

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
lot going on with this pic now I was

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.240 
lot going on with this pic now I was
kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.050> hoping<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.350> get<00:02:43.470> silk<00:02:43.770> touch<00:02:43.980> because

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
kind of hoping to get silk touch because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
kind of hoping to get silk touch because
I<00:02:44.340> got<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.940> server<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.540> was

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
I got that on the server that I was

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.740 
I got that on the server that I was
playing<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:48.120> lot

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
playing on but I know that that is a lot

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.630 
playing on but I know that that is a lot
of<00:02:48.810> stuff<00:02:49.320> going<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.070> pic<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.520> that

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
of stuff going on with that pic and that

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.890 
of stuff going on with that pic and that
it's<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.940> last<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.420> while<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.810> it's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
it's going to last a while and it's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.030 
it's going to last a while and it's
probably<00:02:52.050> going<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> break<00:02:52.530> pretty<00:02:52.770> quickly

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
probably going to break pretty quickly

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.400 
probably going to break pretty quickly
and<00:02:53.310> fortune<00:02:54.090> three<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.390> think<00:02:54.780> means<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
and fortune three I think means that it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.820 
and fortune three I think means that it
gets<00:02:55.590> more<00:02:56.580> than<00:02:56.820> one<00:02:57.060> drop<00:02:57.570> like<00:02:58.380> say<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.739> you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
gets more than one drop like say if you

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.440 
gets more than one drop like say if you
break<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> diamond<00:02:59.489> block<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.820> will<00:02:59.910> give<00:03:00.060> me<00:03:00.180> 1

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
break a diamond block it will give me 1

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.750 
break a diamond block it will give me 1
2<00:03:00.570> or<00:03:00.780> 3<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.800> think<00:03:02.280> that's<00:03:02.580> pretty

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
2 or 3 so I think that's pretty

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.910 
2 or 3 so I think that's pretty
impressive<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.420> might<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.900> add<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
impressive and might I add this is all a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.160 
impressive and might I add this is all a
hundred<00:03:05.459> percent<00:03:05.550> legit<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.330> just<00:03:06.660> legitly

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
hundred percent legit so I just legitly

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.110 
hundred percent legit so I just legitly
got<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> pic<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.820> be<00:03:08.910> awesome

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
