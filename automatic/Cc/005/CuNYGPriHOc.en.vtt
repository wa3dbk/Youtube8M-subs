00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.000 
all right here's what I'm doing right
now<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:18.240> my<00:03:18.420> whole<00:03:18.660> saw<00:03:18.990> was<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.800> little

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
now and my whole saw was just a little

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.100 
now and my whole saw was just a little
bit<00:03:20.130> bigger<00:03:20.400> than<00:03:20.580> my<00:03:20.760> axle<00:03:21.270> was<00:03:21.480> when<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.840> made

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
bit bigger than my axle was when I made

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.500 
bit bigger than my axle was when I made
these<00:03:22.290> tabs<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> had<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.610> tubing<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.240> fit

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
these tabs so I had that tubing that fit

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.280 
these tabs so I had that tubing that fit
perfectly<00:03:25.020> on<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.440> I'm<00:03:26.100> gonna<00:03:26.310> use<00:03:26.550> as<00:03:26.700> spacers

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
perfectly on it I'm gonna use as spacers

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.750 
perfectly on it I'm gonna use as spacers
and<00:03:30.050> so<00:03:31.050> I'll<00:03:31.170> just<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.770> fit<00:03:32.070> perfectly<00:03:32.460> in<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
and so I'll just it fit perfectly in the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.210 
and so I'll just it fit perfectly in the
hole<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.390> my<00:03:33.540> hole<00:03:33.750> saw<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.770> tapped<00:03:35.130> it

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
hole for my hole saw so I just tapped it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.060 
hole for my hole saw so I just tapped it
in<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.790> I'm<00:03:35.850> gonna<00:03:36.290> grind<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:37.620> flat

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
in there and I'm gonna grind it up flat

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.430 
in there and I'm gonna grind it up flat
like<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:39.620> I've<00:03:40.620> done<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.100> one<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:42.440> there

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
like a I've done this one here and there

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.780 
like a I've done this one here and there
you<00:03:43.560> go<00:03:43.709> there's<00:03:44.280> my<00:03:44.370> tab<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> yeah<00:03:47.490> we'll<00:03:47.640> see

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
you go there's my tab so yeah we'll see

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.650 
you go there's my tab so yeah we'll see
how<00:03:47.820> long<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.090> lasts

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
how long that lasts

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.570 
how long that lasts
if<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.590> doesn't<00:03:49.800> I'll<00:03:49.980> take<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.250> apart<00:03:50.490> and

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
if it doesn't I'll take it apart and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.640 
if it doesn't I'll take it apart and
make<00:03:50.670> something<00:03:51.000> else<00:03:51.239> out<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.690> kind<00:03:52.560> of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
make something else out of it kind of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.920 
make something else out of it kind of
looks<00:03:52.830> like<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:54.000> frame<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.360> me<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:54.690> now<00:03:54.720> it

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
looks like the frame to me right now it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.160 
looks like the frame to me right now it
looks<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:56.450> looks<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.660> might<00:03:57.810> be<00:03:57.840> better

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
looks like looks like it might be better

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.130 
looks like looks like it might be better
as<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> three-wheeler<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:59.570> let<00:04:00.570> me<00:04:00.690> write<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.930> is

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
as a three-wheeler so let me write it is

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.770 
as a three-wheeler so let me write it is
a<00:04:01.170> dirt<00:04:01.500> bike<00:04:01.739> or<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.070> little<00:04:02.700> mini<00:04:02.850> bike<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:03.750> a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
a dirt bike or a little mini bike for a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.960 
a dirt bike or a little mini bike for a
little<00:04:03.930> bit<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:04.320> then<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.709> may<00:04:04.890> put<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.370> rear

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
little bit but then we may put a rear

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.550 
little bit but then we may put a rear
axle<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.510> get<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> differential<00:04:07.470> or

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
axle on it get a differential or

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.970 
axle on it get a differential or
something<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.100> bam<00:04:09.260> ground<00:04:10.260> down<00:04:10.530> some<00:04:10.860> of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
something and bam ground down some of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.430 
something and bam ground down some of
the<00:04:11.040> wells<00:04:11.280> don't<00:04:11.820> look<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.180> bad<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.930> tell<00:04:13.380> you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the wells don't look so bad I tell you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.570 
the wells don't look so bad I tell you
about<00:04:13.500> welding<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.989> with<00:04:15.989> my<00:04:16.169> little

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
about welding on that with my little

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:26.530 
about welding on that with my little
store<00:04:18.380> well<00:04:19.669> 110<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:25.290> wire<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:25.770> came<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.250> it

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
store well 110 the wire that came in it

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.810 
store well 110 the wire that came in it
was<00:04:27.540> all<00:04:27.870> welded<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.650> shittiest<00:04:29.010> welds<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.729> I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
was all welded the shittiest welds and I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.200 
was all welded the shittiest welds and I
just<00:04:30.090> attributed<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.130> not<00:04:32.130> welding<00:04:32.790> for

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
just attributed it to not welding for

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.560 
just attributed it to not welding for
like<00:04:33.780> 20<00:04:34.229> years<00:04:34.500> or<00:04:35.160> more<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:37.250> then<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.790> put<00:04:39.540> a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
like 20 years or more and then I put a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.040 
like 20 years or more and then I put a
new<00:04:39.750> wire<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.530> ran<00:04:40.740> out<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:41.010> wire<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:42.050> my

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
new wire in it it ran out of wire and my

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.790 
new wire in it it ran out of wire and my
welds<00:04:43.530> look<00:04:43.910> freaking<00:04:44.910> great<00:04:45.650> there<00:04:46.650> are<00:04:46.770> a

unless<00:04:55.290> you're<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.620> tack<00:04:55.890> welding<00:04:56.280> with<00:04:56.400> it

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
unless you're just tack welding with it

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.420 
unless you're just tack welding with it
and<00:04:57.540> they<00:04:57.660> put<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.900> new<00:04:58.080> school<00:04:58.440> in<00:04:58.650> by<00:04:59.100> school

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
and they put a new school in by school

and they put a new school in by school
when<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.700> buy<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.910> thing<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:01.290> wasn't<00:05:01.530> that

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
when you buy the thing it wasn't that

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.500 
when you buy the thing it wasn't that
expensive<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.520> man<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:02.880> made<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.090> huge

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
expensive and man it made a huge

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.840 
expensive and man it made a huge
difference<00:05:03.750> it's<00:05:04.410> even<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.610> burned

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
difference it's even like it burned

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.610 
difference it's even like it burned
hotter<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.510> know<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.780> just<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.290> was<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.440> lot

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
hotter you know it just it was a lot

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.870 
hotter you know it just it was a lot
better<00:05:07.820> but<00:05:08.820> yeah<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.470> found<00:05:10.470> this<00:05:10.650> that's<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
better but yeah I found this that's the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.340 
better but yeah I found this that's the
bottom<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.440> office<00:05:14.160> chair<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.690> I
