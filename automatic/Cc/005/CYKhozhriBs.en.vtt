00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.811
 Butcher Review 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.860
 In the notes Horadrim Sanctuary 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.310
 mentions of the Butcher are infrequent. 

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:28.705
 For twenty years, he was seen only twice. 

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.595
 But many fell victim to the demon, 

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.445
 settled in Tristram. 

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:36.853
 Rumor has it that the Butcher is assembled 

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.103
 from the remains of other demons, 

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:43.413
 therefore perceives other living (and non-living) 

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.952
 like the future parts of yourself. 

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.455
 The Butcher is a brutal killer who attacks melee. 

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.804
 It builds up power and damage, 

00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:56.300
 eating the bodies of defeated enemies. 

00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:00.250
 Butcher's skill is Fresh Meat. 

00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:02.214
 When an enemy dies nearby, 

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:03.764
 from it remains a piece of meat. 

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.633
 For the warriors, 1 piece is given, and for the heroes - 3. 

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:09.904
 Every piece of meat eaten increases the damage 

00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:12.254
 inflicted by the Butcher until he perishes. 

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:15.308
 His first ability is "Pruning Tendons". 

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:17.158
 The butcher chops with an ax in front of him, 

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:19.808
 deals damage and slows down all hit targets 

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.658
 at a great distance. 

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:25.659
 The next ability is the Butcher Brand. 

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:28.872
 The butcher strikes with a sickle with his left hand 

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.122
 and marks the target for 5 sec. 

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:33.505
 This allows him to steal health. 

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:36.755
 in the amount of 75% of the damage done. 

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.741
 When used against heroes 

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:40.255
 healing efficiency doubles. 

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.890
 The last ability is "Ruthless Jerk." 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.030
 Butcher becomes uncontrollable and rushes to the goal, 

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:49.134
 like a fiend. 

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:53.754
 Overtaking the target, he stuns it, dealing damage. 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.709
 "Burst of the Fern" - the first of two 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.759
 heroic abilities Butcher. 

00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:02.459
 After a three-second pause, a flame surrounds him, 

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:06.309
 causing great damage to nearby enemies. 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.817
 This ability can be used 

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:10.567
 when using the "ruthless jerk." 

00:02:11.547 --> 00:02:13.447
 Finally, the second heroic ability - 

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.697
 "Lamb to the slaughter." 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.867
 The butcher sets in the specified place the pillar 

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:19.616
 and after a pause rivets him 

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.866
 the nearest enemy hero. 

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:25.458
 The chain does not give a goal to leave the area. 

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:31.088
 The beginning of the game is the most important stage for the Butcher. 

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:34.227
 You need to get as much meat as possible, 

00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:36.277
 before the battles with the heroes of the enemy begin. 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.239
 Butcher can get a lot of meat, 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.989
 killing warriors on the line and collecting new pieces. 

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:44.585
 Another possible option - 

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:46.195
 to hunt enemy heroes in pairs, 

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:48.745
 trying to score more kills. 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 But be careful 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.610
 you risk losing all the accumulated meat, 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.160
 if you do not calculate the strength and die. 

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:00.558
 When the Butcher collected enough fresh meat, 

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.808
 worth trying to isolate opponents 

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.058
 using the "Ruthless jerk." 

00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:07.870
 Attack the wounded opponent 

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.721
 and put the "Butcher Brand" on it. 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.726
 Use the ability to cut the tendons, 

00:03:11.776 --> 00:03:13.076
 if the target is trying to retreat. 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:14.819
 Taking a successful position 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.069
 The butcher will cope with anyone a couple of auto attacks. 

00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:21.205
 Abyssal Lamb Ability 

00:03:21.454 --> 00:03:23.454
 ideal for isolation purposes. 

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:25.920
 Engage her at the beginning of the battle 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.670
 or prevent a strong opponent 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.320
 engage in a skirmish 

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:31.111
 providing his team an advantage. 

00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:33.648
 "Burst of Iron" will do, 

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:35.398
 if you want to do more damage 

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.148
 and kill opponents. 

00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:39.497
 Try to use the ability, 

00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:41.347
 when there are several goals around you 

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:43.197
 to increase its effectiveness. 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.427
 If you fight against the Butcher, 

00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:48.377
 try to attack him in a group 

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.427
 and destroy as quickly as possible. 

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:53.963
 If he fails to use the Brand, 

00:03:54.113 --> 00:03:56.313
 then you can handle it easily. 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.310
 FRESH MEAT!
