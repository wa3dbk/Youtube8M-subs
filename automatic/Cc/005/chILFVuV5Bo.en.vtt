00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
when I think of linebackers I think a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.299 
when I think of linebackers I think a
Dick<00:00:09.210> Butkus<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.809> Willy<00:00:10.260> Lanier<00:00:11.150> Bobby<00:00:12.150> Bell

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
Dick Butkus and Willy Lanier Bobby Bell

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.799 
Dick Butkus and Willy Lanier Bobby Bell
you<00:00:14.309> know<00:00:14.340> there's<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.030> great<00:00:15.420> great

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
you know there's some great great

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.340 
you know there's some great great
linebackers<00:00:16.770> who<00:00:17.279> had<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> things<00:00:18.359> they

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
linebackers who had a lot of things they

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.590 
linebackers who had a lot of things they
could<00:00:19.410> rush<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> passer<00:00:20.130> they<00:00:21.060> could<00:00:21.270> cover

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
could rush the passer they could cover

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.109 
could rush the passer they could cover
receivers<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:23.160> could<00:00:23.340> stuff<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> run

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
receivers and they could stuff the run

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.019 
receivers and they could stuff the run
now<00:00:24.330> think<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.320> DB<00:00:26.070> you

now think about that you are a DB you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.919 
now think about that you are a DB you
are<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> lineman<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.890> linebacker<00:00:29.099> right<00:00:30.060> the

start with feet right I start with

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
start with feet right I start with
flexibility<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.710> start<00:00:41.100> with

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
flexibility and I start with

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
explosiveness right so those things you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.700 
explosiveness right so those things you
have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.850> play<00:00:45.059> every<00:00:45.239> position<00:00:45.710> now
