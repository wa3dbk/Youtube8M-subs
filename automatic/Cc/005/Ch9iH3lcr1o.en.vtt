00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
then I just adjust all of the feeding to

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.740 
then I just adjust all of the feeding to
get<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> job<00:01:00.300> done<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.460> alternative<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.850> have

that I'm using here and I have a switch
here<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:13.290> power<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.760> pump<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.830> turn

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
here to to power up the pump if I turn

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.609 
here to to power up the pump if I turn
on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> switch<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.509> light<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> best<00:01:19.170> value

on the switch this light the best value

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.399 
on the switch this light the best value
I<00:01:20.900> obviously<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:23.240> instant<00:01:24.240> water<00:01:24.630> running

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
I obviously I have instant water running

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.899 
I obviously I have instant water running
water<00:01:25.830> inside<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.680> my<00:01:28.680> avance<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:33.500> here<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
water inside of my my avance so here I

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.280 
water inside of my my avance so here I
have<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:37.640> all<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:39.060> my<00:01:39.270> hoses<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.590> water<00:01:40.979> Pam

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
have my all of my hoses and my water Pam

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.530 
have my all of my hoses and my water Pam
my<00:01:42.950> water<00:01:43.280> pampies<00:01:44.710> feeds<00:01:45.710> from<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.850> water

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
my water pampies feeds from this water

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.440 
my water pampies feeds from this water
tank<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.740> have<00:01:49.070> here<00:01:51.010> my<00:01:52.010> water<00:01:52.280> pump

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
tank that I have here my water pump

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.800 
tank that I have here my water pump
fits<00:01:54.050> from<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:56.770> from<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.780> my<00:02:01.810> my

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
fits from this from this this is my my

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.430 
fits from this from this this is my my
water<00:02:03.110> tank<00:02:03.940> freshwater<00:02:04.940> tank<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.140> use

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
water tank freshwater tank that I use

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.850 
water tank freshwater tank that I use
for<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.850> sink<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:10.870> if<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.080> see<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:12.650> I

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
for the the sink and if you see here I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.320 
for the the sink and if you see here I
have<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:14.780> look<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.440> regular<00:02:17.200> sink

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
have all this look like a regular sink

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920 
have all this look like a regular sink
so<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.360> did<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.050> fit<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.930> this

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
so I did all the fit in here and this

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.290 
so I did all the fit in here and this
hose<00:02:26.500> gains<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.190> water<00:02:28.520> tank

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
hose gains from the water tank

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.530 
hose gains from the water tank
now<00:02:30.230> pumps<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:32.890> pumps<00:02:33.890> my<00:02:34.130> my<00:02:34.760> water<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.390> my

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
now pumps the pumps my my water to my

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.420 
now pumps the pumps my my water to my
faucet<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.490> system<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:38.000> automatic<00:02:39.430> just

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
faucet so this system is automatic just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.090 
faucet so this system is automatic just
start<00:02:40.970> working<00:02:41.600> when<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.410> pump

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
start working when the pump

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.540 
start working when the pump
the<00:02:43.700> text<00:02:44.410> detects<00:02:45.410> some<00:02:45.650> low<00:02:46.190> pressure

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
the text detects some low pressure

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.720 
the text detects some low pressure
inside<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.450> circuit<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.520> can<00:02:49.670> see

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
inside the circuit so as you can see

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.670 
inside the circuit so as you can see
it's<00:02:50.510> very<00:02:50.630> loud<00:02:53.140> doesn't<00:02:54.140> make<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> lot<00:02:54.620> of

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's very loud doesn't make a lot of

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.100 
it's very loud doesn't make a lot of
noise<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:58.090> yeah<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.420> step<00:02:59.780> works

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
noise and yeah this step works

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.759 
noise and yeah this step works
absolutely<00:03:00.970> great<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.350> little

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
absolutely great so this is a little

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.479 
absolutely great so this is a little
video<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.310> show<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.580> how<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.060> set<00:03:05.300> up<00:03:05.750> my<00:03:06.489> my

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
video to show you how I set up my my

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.229 
video to show you how I set up my my
water<00:03:08.000> pump<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.660> my<00:03:09.290> sink<00:03:09.940> inside<00:03:10.940> my

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
water pump and my sink inside my

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.070 
water pump and my sink inside my
campervan<00:03:12.050> hope<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.280> one<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.940> useful<00:03:14.600> for

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080
