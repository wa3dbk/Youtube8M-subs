traction<00:00:22.900> control<00:00:23.110> because<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:24.390> few<00:00:25.390> days<00:00:25.570> ago

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
traction control because a few days ago

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.320 
traction control because a few days ago
I<00:00:26.170> had<00:00:26.710> an<00:00:26.980> experience<00:00:27.220> where<00:00:27.820> attachment

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
I had an experience where attachment

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.630 
I had an experience where attachment
control<00:00:28.660> saved<00:00:29.530> me<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.710> boatload<00:00:29.950> of<00:00:30.160> money<00:00:30.280> and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
control saved me a boatload of money and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.320 
control saved me a boatload of money and
potential<00:00:31.060> injury

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
potential injury

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.090 
potential injury
so<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.990> was<00:00:34.290> writing<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:35.180> work<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
so I was writing to work and it was a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.550 
so I was writing to work and it was a
bit<00:00:38.250> dark<00:00:38.630> and<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:39.720> must<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.080> hit<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> patch<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
bit dark and I must have hit a patch of

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.920 
bit dark and I must have hit a patch of
sand<00:00:40.980> making<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.030> right-hand<00:00:42.210> turn<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:45.450> what

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
sand making a right-hand turn and what

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.810 
sand making a right-hand turn and what
happened<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.130> like<00:00:47.190> maybe<00:00:47.489> 30

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
happened was I was going like maybe 30

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.540 
happened was I was going like maybe 30
40<00:00:48.180> miles<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:48.870> hour<00:00:48.960> speed<00:00:49.440> limit<00:00:49.530> 45<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.400> was

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
40 miles an hour speed limit 45 so I was

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.590 
40 miles an hour speed limit 45 so I was
definitely<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:51.030> under<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.330> speed<00:00:51.570> limit

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
definitely going under the speed limit

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.570 
definitely going under the speed limit
but<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.260> happened<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.650> my<00:00:52.860> rear<00:00:53.040> tire<00:00:53.280> slid

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
but what happened was my rear tire slid

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.610 
but what happened was my rear tire slid
out<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.730> felt<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> print<00:00:57.570> traction<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.290> laid

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
out and I felt it print traction I laid

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.100 
out and I felt it print traction I laid
on<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> left<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> throttle<00:01:01.020> like

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
on the way I left on the throttle like

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.490 
on the way I left on the throttle like
you're<00:01:01.260> supposed<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:04.199> traction

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you're supposed to and my traction

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.590 
you're supposed to and my traction
control<00:01:04.979> did<00:01:05.160> was<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> slowly<00:01:05.880> regained<00:01:06.450> my

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
control did was it slowly regained my

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.530 
control did was it slowly regained my
traction<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:08.460> starts<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.940> like<00:01:09.090> click<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
traction it starts to like click the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
traction it starts to like click the
power<00:01:09.750> turned<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:10.770> rapidly<00:01:11.190> pretty

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
power turned on and off rapidly pretty

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.460 
power turned on and off rapidly pretty
quick<00:01:13.820> what<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> did<00:01:15.149> was<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.110> lot

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
quick what that did was that was a lot

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.649 
quick what that did was that was a lot
of<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:16.740> regain<00:01:17.610> traction

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
of they regain traction

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.120 
of they regain traction
now<00:01:20.140> if<00:01:20.290> I<00:01:20.380> didn't<00:01:20.560> have<00:01:20.680> traction<00:01:20.920> control

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
now if I didn't have traction control

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.130 
now if I didn't have traction control
there's<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.729> good<00:01:21.880> chance<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.780> would

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
there's a good chance that I I would

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.230 
there's a good chance that I I would
have<00:01:23.229> went<00:01:23.380> down<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.890> mean<00:01:24.460> it's<00:01:24.640> possible<00:01:24.820> that

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
have went down I mean it's possible that

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.539 
have went down I mean it's possible that
I<00:01:25.539> would<00:01:26.350> have<00:01:26.439> regain<00:01:26.740> traction<00:01:26.950> normally

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
I would have regain traction normally

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.730 
I would have regain traction normally
anyways<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.090> because<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.450> was<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.659> at<00:01:29.530> least

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
anyways just because I was a at least

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.870 
anyways just because I was a at least
left<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> throttle<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.549> like<00:01:30.729> they're

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
left the throttle on like they're

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.350 
left the throttle on like they're
supposed<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.770> I'd<00:01:32.890> say<00:01:33.189> bigger<00:01:33.909> chance<00:01:34.210> to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
supposed to but I'd say bigger chance to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
supposed to but I'd say bigger chance to
not<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.509> would<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.869> low<00:01:35.679> sighted<00:01:36.130> definitely

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
not I would have low sighted definitely

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
not I would have low sighted definitely
possibly<00:01:38.460> even<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.790> high<00:01:38.910> side<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> high<00:01:39.360> side

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
possibly even a high side the high side

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.830 
possibly even a high side the high side
is<00:01:40.080> when<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.910> going<00:01:41.910> through<00:01:42.180> corner<00:01:42.600> your

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
is when you're going through corner your

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
is when you're going through corner your
rear<00:01:43.050> brakes<00:01:43.350> traction<00:01:43.620> and<00:01:44.370> what<00:01:44.580> happens<00:01:44.940> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
rear brakes traction and what happens is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.630 
rear brakes traction and what happens is
you<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.900> know<00:01:45.990> chop<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.380> throttle<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.950> do

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you you know chop the throttle or do

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.390 
you you know chop the throttle or do
something<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.150> causes<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.400> regain

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
something that causes you to regain

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.730 
something that causes you to regain
traction<00:01:50.910> suddenly<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> throws<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.620> off

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
traction suddenly and it throws you off

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.350 
traction suddenly and it throws you off
the<00:01:52.890> bike<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> sudden<00:01:54.210> jolt

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
the bike because of the sudden jolt

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.690 
the bike because of the sudden jolt
but<00:01:56.780> yeah<00:01:56.870> I<00:01:56.900> get<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> lot<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.710> people<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.490> send

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
that traction control on a bike like

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.620 
that traction control on a bike like
this<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.240> stupid<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:04.190> here's<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:05.450> was<00:02:05.600> a

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
this is stupid and here's a that was a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.930 
this is stupid and here's a that was a
really<00:02:05.840> good<00:02:06.020> example<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.530> why<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.280> wanted

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
really good example of why I wanted

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.400 
really good example of why I wanted
traction<00:02:08.390> control<00:02:08.750> because<00:02:08.960> I<00:02:09.110> didn't<00:02:09.320> have

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
traction control because I didn't have

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.780 
traction control because I didn't have
much<00:02:09.619> control<00:02:09.979> over<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.310> surface

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.270 

it<00:02:15.790> was<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.050> pretty<00:02:17.050> dark<00:02:17.350> down<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.800> could<00:02:18.250> see

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
it was a pretty dark down I could see

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.830 
it was a pretty dark down I could see
pretty<00:02:18.580> well<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.820> went<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.420> next<00:02:19.600> day<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
pretty well I went back the next day and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.570 
pretty well I went back the next day and
there<00:02:20.080> was<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.230> bunch<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.770> sand<00:02:21.070> just<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
there was a bunch of sand just on the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.150 
there was a bunch of sand just on the
road<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.750> very<00:02:22.990> fine-grain<00:02:23.650> sand<00:02:23.680> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
road but it's very fine-grain sand it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.370 
road but it's very fine-grain sand it
looked<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:24.430> somebody<00:02:24.640> spilt<00:02:25.150> something

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
looked like somebody spilt something

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.600 
looked like somebody spilt something
like<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> bag<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.760> kitty<00:02:29.480> litter<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.930> something

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
like a bag of kitty litter or something

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.130 
like a bag of kitty litter or something
but<00:02:31.610> either<00:02:31.850> way<00:02:31.970> that's<00:02:32.150> my<00:02:32.540> blog<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.080> that's

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
but either way that's my blog and that's

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.380 
but either way that's my blog and that's
why<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> ride<00:02:34.010> with<00:02:34.460> traction<00:02:34.700> control<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
why I ride with traction control and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.300 
why I ride with traction control and
that's<00:02:35.510> why<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> feel<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.380> important<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:36.920> any

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
that's why I feel it's important on any

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.540 
that's why I feel it's important on any
cc<00:02:37.850> bike<00:02:38.030> 250<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> way<00:02:39.740> up<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.810> zx-14r

cc bike 250 all the way up to the zx-14r
everybody<00:02:43.550> should<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.760> traction<00:02:44.060> control

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
everybody should have traction control

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.900 
everybody should have traction control
and<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.720> think<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.920> few<00:02:46.130> years<00:02:46.460> it'll<00:02:46.670> be<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
and I think in a few years it'll be the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.490 
and I think in a few years it'll be the
standard<00:02:47.270> for<00:02:47.300> motorcycle<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:48.350> like

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
standard for motorcycle it's just like

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.020 
standard for motorcycle it's just like

it is today for cars when they came out

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.370 
it is today for cars when they came out

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
