00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.769
 hello welcome to a new gym video 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.660
 battle 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.230
 this time we want to show you the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.510
 blue live keyboard is in another video 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.600
 we show you what the new afternoon was like 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.190
 it had come out blue with windows 8 and os 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.020
 we said that as soon as we had here the 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.930
 keyboard if we are going to teach also how 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.600
 it was the keyboard that was accompanying the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.600
 It's worth in principle we have here 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.579
 You see a keyboard that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.679
 that comes with battery 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.500
 what it does is prolong the autonomy of 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.600
 Battery afternoon hours are 8 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.979
 8 hours that the tablet has and 8 hours 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.790
 that has the keyboard would give us a total 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.890
 from 16 hours 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.150
 well then on the keyboard what we want 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.019
 Apart from the battery is a USB connector 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.079
 on one side 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.179
 and on the other hand we have a connector that 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.549
 this would be the charging connector because 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.280
 once we put the tablet in the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.829
 keyboard the charging connector of yours that is 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.179
 the one that stays here in used 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.189
 then to be able to load it without 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.140
 we run out of battery we would connect 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 here on this side 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.210
 well then 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.850
 We have the tablet here 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.689
 it would be with the hooks 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.030
 what I would have here and another one that would have 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 here the charging connector that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.670
 I would take here 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 personally it would be 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.060
 a mouse would not work perfectly 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.150
 the tactile would still work although 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.690
 let's put the keyboard does not mean that 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.230
 the touch screen stops working 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.230
 OK 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.670
 and well, well 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.640
 and one of the advantages we have with 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.000
 this is that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.190
 if it's not worth it or we do not like touch 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.630
 pad that the keyboards carry since always 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.630
 we can connect a mouse 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.640
 and the keyboard 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.640
 and the mouse would not work perfectly 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.460
 and now I only have to show you once 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.690
 be closed 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.880
 the weight 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.870
 increases the logical weight a little more by 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.310
 the battery that also carries the keyboard 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.310
 it is not uncomfortable to carry 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.130
 and aesthetically it looks pretty nice 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.110
 OK 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.700
 Well, in principle it will be all like 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.530
 we chose and we wanted to teach also the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.890
 sin you have it 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.700
 and nothing but a greet from game battle and 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.700
 until the next video
