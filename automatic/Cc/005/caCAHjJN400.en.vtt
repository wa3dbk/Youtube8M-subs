don't have it in front of it right now I
think<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.520> 1440<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.620> again

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
think it's 1440 but it's and again

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.240 
think it's 1440 but it's and again
that's<00:02:23.099> something<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.640> own<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> lot<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:26.190> a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.570 
is that with the new smaller form factor
comes<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.540> smaller<00:03:09.840> memory<00:03:10.140> card<00:03:10.590> not<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
buy micro SD cards sure they're not much

buy micro SD cards sure they're not much
more<00:03:30.690> expensive<00:03:30.930> they're<00:03:31.260> probably<00:03:31.440> about

more expensive they're probably about

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.170 
more expensive they're probably about

as a standard size SD card but that's

as a standard size SD card but that's
another<00:03:37.830> cost<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:38.310> take<00:03:38.489> into<00:03:38.670> consideration

you're probably going to need extra
batteries<00:03:46.080> well<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.670> means<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
batteries well that means you like to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.850 
batteries well that means you like to
buy<00:03:48.360> extra<00:03:48.690> batteries<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.290> are<00:03:49.319> that<00:03:49.739> will

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
buy extra batteries that are that will

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.960 
buy extra batteries that are that will
fit<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:51.019> hero3<00:03:52.019> camera<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.860> on<00:03:53.580> top<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.819> that

fit the hero3 camera and on top of that

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.839 
fit the hero3 camera and on top of that
if<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.330> want<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.540> charge<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.080> field

you're<00:03:56.849> probably<00:03:57.030> going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.299> have<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.480> buy<00:03:57.659> a

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
you're probably going to have to buy a

you're probably going to have to buy a
field<00:03:57.989> charger<00:03:58.319> that's<00:03:58.379> more<00:03:58.650> money<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.159> you

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
field charger that's more money so you

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.309 
field charger that's more money so you
