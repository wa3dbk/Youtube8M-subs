00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.690
 it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.800
 here we are with guys are black keys e 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 let's say we're almost there 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 on another video of black ops 2 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.650
 concerning zombie our beautiful mode 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.380
 bleed rendered mina who does not know what he wants 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.970
 say fired at random and say this 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.180
 in this video I show you how you can 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.850
 upgrade and upgrade the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.220
 your bus you see outside 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.540
 outside and will wait until 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.989
 from the beginning the bus will become words 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:10.480
 more accessible with pieces that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:14.260
 they will allow you to enter it more easily 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.260
 move better so better avoid than 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.080
 zombies say yes in all maps 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.130
 of areas the areas of the map that one 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.950
 very great if we pay for what 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.290
 therefore it is necessary to construct objects 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:35.430
 there is a turbine built a turbine 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.840
 that would be the electricity we say with 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.870
 portable manual electricity a little 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.090
 fancy we say and will serve to open 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.520
 these doors require kids 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.590
 precisely energy is written buson 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.370
 required energy to be able to open the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.110
 doors as you see the doors open 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.510
 it's bullshit 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.000
 and here are the pieces obviously I make a 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.540
 piece says to pick up a piece and it is 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.360
 as you can see the kind of ladder here 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.330
 little one a little bit the ladder 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.250
 I'll get this shit out of the deal come in 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.910
 in the bus you can do 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.760
 immediately 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.290
 you will see that we issue this 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.420
 ladder above up guys yes 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.930
 where it would usually open because 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.880
 zombies make a gap in boys 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 look amazing we have this 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.920
 ladder that you can climb from 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.710
 above the bus in china on the roof e 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.710
 from which we can do precisely say 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.150
 mass destruction of zombies and 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.480
 it will allow an easy one 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.220
 evacuation of the bus and will return 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.130
 as you have now to kill me 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870
 several without problems another part 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.630
 it will be taken in another area 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.270
 guys the areas if I'm not mistaken four 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.860
 tops I never remember and what was a 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.380
 piece I spent little making a piece 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.790
 but it serves to make the shield and we will see more 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.860
 go ahead as you do at maicon you need it 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.260
 shield on zombies in this area here 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.840
 we find the second piece on a rock 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.090
 I hope you guys tops now how 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.970
 see here is a ladder 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.980
 this second important piece will be there 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.860
 really an aid advantage 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.320
 overtime with the bus for maybe 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.690
 we are hindered and know that it started 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.790
 around as you will soon see at 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.800
 construction that we do would have one 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.170
 extreme ease of getting on e 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.380
 the bus came back from another side 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.300
 that is not from here but equal to boys 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.710
 simply life on this corner in 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.390
 low back left and mounted 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.190
 quietly the ladder is a wall you have 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.630
 the ladder ready and from here you can 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.360
 climb safely on the roof 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.590
 kill whoever you want and help the ai 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.870
 your companions who are inside and 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.150
 safely enter the bus 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.640
 and to be able to enter and exit but you have to 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.000
 enter quit without problems and you will have 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.100
 a really useful entry 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.859
 if perhaps avoiding the other side 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.670
 envelope starting guys really very much 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.680
 useful very little it makes his grandparents in all 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.840
 the areas of the map will be found 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.570
 because anyway maybe you could find it 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.120
 then I didn't find the piece and we say 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.220
 that the place where I am 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.520
 in the five zones or four zones is 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.570
 random as you see here I was looking for precisely 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.070
 the plow that will be behind the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.680
 tractor encrusted in this note 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.690
 game was not there was not here 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.240
 as you can see I played with a can 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.190
 vomano there is sign there is no sign of 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.200
 this piece is a pretty piece 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.760
 large and the surplus of the case 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.560
 and instead here guys here is another one 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.150
 bring your turbine there 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.360
 went to this area here to the end 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.640
 to the fore, quiet, straight, straight up 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.080
 to this little door here and should this one 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.480
 little door put the dot there for 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.160
 the umpteenth time from vendola you give energy 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.130
 and voila 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.720
 here it is the plow as you have seen 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.169
 swirling compounds destroys 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.979
 automatically and therefore and therefore not 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.529
 will have much chance of 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.389
 to get used to time because 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.189
 however things are consumed up here 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.879
 black ops is also right because if the 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:35.819
 it would be to have things easy 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.249
 you can still resume and then 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.499
 as you see here I put this piece e 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.599
 ie the case unlocked the goal also 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.849
 part on the car of the dead this there 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.219
 will allow to divert zombies not 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.289
 let them get inside for the le 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.789
 main windows in front of the bus 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.949
 that they would enter a lot of tano 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.689
 annoyance sometimes the kid was a 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.020
 enough video will have the video lighthouse art 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:59.180
 of other zombies and other small ones 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.039
 features 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.939
 no guys this round i hope there is 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.919
 help status 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.779
 a greeting from black keys you see I place myself 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.029
 and comment, sign up if you want 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.689
 follow other videos and we get to the 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:15.649
 next a salutone stay tuned cesa 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.649
 nice guys
