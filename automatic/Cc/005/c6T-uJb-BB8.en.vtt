00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
talking to Arthur Parsons the game

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
talking to Arthur Parsons the game
director<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.590> Twitter<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.100> morning<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.750> he

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
director on Twitter this morning and he

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
director on Twitter this morning and he
basically<00:01:55.020> said<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.680> probably<00:01:55.950> won't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
basically said that we probably won't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.420 
basically said that we probably won't
hear<00:01:56.460> anything<00:01:56.759> until<00:01:57.170> around<00:01:58.170> III<00:01:58.829> time<00:01:59.130> from

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
hear anything until around III time from

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
hear anything until around III time from
the<00:01:59.579> game<00:01:59.729> which<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.270> perfectly

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the game which is perfectly

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.030 
the game which is perfectly
understandable<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.680> said<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
understandable because he also said that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.830 
understandable because he also said that
the<00:02:02.460> reason<00:02:02.759> they're<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.299> showing<00:02:03.479> anything

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the reason they're not showing anything

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.179 
the reason they're not showing anything
is<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.590> want<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> spoil

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
is because they don't want to spoil

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.730 
is because they don't want to spoil
anything<00:02:05.460> from<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> actual<00:02:06.450> movie<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.380> for

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
anything from the actual movie so for

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.350 
anything from the actual movie so for
example<00:02:07.829> they<00:02:08.250> might<00:02:08.369> show<00:02:08.640> something<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
example they might show something that a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.780 
example they might show something that a
character<00:02:09.660> does<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:11.009> screenshot<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
character does in a screenshot and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.610 
character does in a screenshot and
that'll<00:02:12.000> spoil<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> movie<00:02:12.599> completely<00:02:13.080> those

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that'll spoil the movie completely those

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.750 
that'll spoil the movie completely those
types<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.830> things<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.129> have<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.400> really

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
types of things you have to be really

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.729 
types of things you have to be really
careful<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.870> course<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.230> also

careful of and that of course is also

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.940 
careful of and that of course is also
the<00:02:16.890> reason<00:02:17.040> we're<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.400> seeing<00:02:17.700> anything<00:02:17.940> on

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950
