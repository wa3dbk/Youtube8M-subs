to another clan of the similar group of
the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.070 
the
vectors<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:19.340> comparison<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.750> actually

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
vectors in comparison so it's actually

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.230 
vectors in comparison so it's actually
very<00:02:21.110> very<00:02:21.350> simple<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.550> very<00:02:22.700> direct<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
very very simple so it's very direct and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.560 
very very simple so it's very direct and
simple<00:02:23.540> comparison<00:02:24.460> so<00:02:25.460> so<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.240> minimum

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
simple comparison so so the minimum

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.810 
simple comparison so so the minimum
requirement<00:02:27.410> eligibility<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.460> for<00:02:28.640> clan

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
requirement eligibility to go for clan

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.690 
requirement eligibility to go for clan
wars<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.240> 10<00:02:29.630> members<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.860> need<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.430> at

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
wars is 10 members you need to have at

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.560 
wars is 10 members you need to have at
least<00:02:31.760> 10<00:02:32.330> members<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.410> be<00:02:33.860> eligible<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:35.000> go<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
least 10 members to be eligible to go to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.700 
least 10 members to be eligible to go to
war<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.410> what<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.400> next<00:02:37.690> matching<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.900> with

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
war so what is the next matching is with

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.930 
war so what is the next matching is with
a<00:02:39.910> multiplication<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.240> 5<00:02:41.570> 10<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.050> 10<00:02:42.500> 15<00:02:43.250> 20<00:02:43.790> 25

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
a multiplication of 5 10 is 10 15 20 25

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.410 
a multiplication of 5 10 is 10 15 20 25
30<00:02:44.660> 35<00:02:45.110> 40<00:02:45.770> 45<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:47.030> 50<00:02:47.690> vs<00:02:48.650> 50<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:50.060> happens

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
30 35 40 45 and 50 vs 50 so what happens

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.870 
30 35 40 45 and 50 vs 50 so what happens
if<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.780> have<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:51.770> example<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.310> got<00:02:52.550> chopped

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
if you have for example you got chopped

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.150 
if you have for example you got chopped
members<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.720> person<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.290> 10<00:02:54.740> members

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
members and that person is 10 members

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.449 
members and that person is 10 members
what<00:02:55.400> happens<00:02:55.820> then<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.959> chop<00:02:57.770> members<00:02:58.130> to

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
what happens then so chop members to

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.460 
what happens then so chop members to
members<00:02:58.790> will<00:02:58.970> be<00:02:59.000> not<00:02:59.630> eligible<00:03:00.230> to

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
members will be not eligible to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.430 
members will be not eligible to
participate<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.150> they'll<00:03:02.330> be<00:03:02.480> spectator<00:03:03.050> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
participate so they'll be spectator and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.580 
participate so they'll be spectator and
the<00:03:03.950> 10<00:03:04.190> members<00:03:04.580> will<00:03:05.060> versus<00:03:05.450> attend<00:03:05.840> top

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the 10 members will versus attend top

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.370 
the 10 members will versus attend top
members<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.790> clan<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.540> who<00:03:08.810> will<00:03:09.020> be<00:03:09.050> not

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
members of that clan so who will be not

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.730 
members of that clan so who will be not
eligible<00:03:09.920> people<00:03:10.220> who<00:03:10.820> are<00:03:11.030> less<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:12.020> trophies

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
eligible people who are less in trophies

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.010 
eligible people who are less in trophies
compared<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> rest<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.360> clan<00:03:14.660> so

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
compared to the rest of the clan so

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.110 
compared to the rest of the clan so
let's<00:03:15.530> say<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.620> got<00:03:15.860> 40<00:03:16.220> members<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.820> 10

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
let's say you got 40 members and 10

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.449 
let's say you got 40 members and 10
members<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.440> got<00:03:18.620> four<00:03:18.830> members<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.220> is

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
members so you got four members that is

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.060 
members so you got four members that is
not<00:03:19.610> eligible<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.390> lowest<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.350> members<00:03:21.740> they

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
climb walls and do not participate to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.250 
climb walls and do not participate to
attack<00:03:46.130> but<00:03:46.760> their<00:03:46.970> base<00:03:47.239> will<00:03:47.570> still<00:03:47.900> be

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
attack but their base will still be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.120 
attack but their base will still be
available<00:03:49.130> for<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.840> other<00:03:50.989> opponent<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.100> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
available for the other opponent of the
