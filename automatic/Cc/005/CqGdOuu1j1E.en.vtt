 crisis when they unexpectedly met

 in Moscow they talked about something 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.470
 they said everything will be as I planned 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.480
 today's meeting in Minsk is the best 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.730
 confirmation of the three presidents by the way 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.470
 never hide that work on 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.150
 the creation of a treaty on Eurasian 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.739
 economic union is not at all 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.380
 you just need to agree 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.320
 an incredible amount of different parts 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.059
 but the road is known to be mastered by going to 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.100
 Minsk successful negotiations today 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.750
 had literally everything on 1 for this 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.430
 added at the airport met not only 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.020
 great weather but also girls 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.000
 national Belarusian costumes 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.280
 who immediately treated the guest 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.530
 festive loaf mood was and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.810
 Alexander Lukashenko hugs like this 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.850
 just a very dear guest two 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 President almost immediately retired them 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.360
 there was something to talk about but nursultan 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 Nazarbayev also had something to say 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.590
 the general public 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.680
 today talking about the Russian 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.640
 economic union some of the experts 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.659
 and politicians scare the world public 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.990
 opinion and our citizens some 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.030
 mythical information of the Soviet Union 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.540
 I think that the reasoning on this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.369
 distant reality and baseless 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.090
 first today for this reincarnation 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.600
 Soviet-style, and there is simply no 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.119
 national base 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.299
 all finally and irrevocably became 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.970
 heritage of history secondly the nations and 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.950
 post-Soviet space built 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.819
 own statehood 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.799
 with its features and traditions in 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.959
 third current ownership system 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.939
 social structures and economic 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.999
 lifestyle our societies 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.680
 gone far ahead from soviet balls 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.049
 Nursultan Nazarbayev clarified all this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.120
 said more than once but who cares 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.040
 does not understand and therefore it is necessary time for 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.049
 again repeat the Head of State for 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.150
 teixeira said why foreign 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.189
 powers oppose eurasian 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.689
 economic union is typical 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.969
 unfair competition 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.709
 Well, who needs a strong geopolitical 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.859
 competitor but here are just a few 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.150
 minutes ago to nursultan nazarbayev and 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.120
 Alexander Lukashenko joined and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.279
 Vladimir Putin expected that leaders 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.799
 among other things, they will discuss joining 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:59.409
 the customs union of kyrgyzstan and armenia 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.389
 and Bishkek and Yerevan to this almost 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.029
 ready well and it is possible that 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.370
 today the president and three states 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.199
 unofficially approve another decision on 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.659
 that supranational bodies 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.199
 Eurasian Union will be located in 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.329
 Astana 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:16.680
