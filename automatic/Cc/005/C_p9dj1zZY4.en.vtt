00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everybody, how are you? Last year did a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 video talking about my college 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.660
 graphic design and I graduated in the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.509
 2013 and since then I always receive and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.059
 mails and comments is asking which 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.869
 materials that lose in college she 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.820
 He said it's not a college, yes, it's 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.699
 You'll have to buy that way too much. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 material at all periods is plus is 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.570
 in the first period because it has 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.519
 a lot of stuff you're going to mess with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 computer or else materials have 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.620
 Eight and when I say stuff I 'm 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.780
 speaking of lais had to what the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
 teacher asks the students in the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.149
 college is in the first period in 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.940
 artistic design and art theory. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 color and in that area I had to buy 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.010
 some things that were important 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.660
 take every class but outside this is during 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.500
 the faculty is that you will need 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.989
 purchase 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.050
 are things that for example or make a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.149
 work and you want to use such a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 I only work then I go there and buy the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 Whatever you want you'll worry about 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 have a kit of materials anyway 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.000
 it is clear at the beginning of the college that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 Yes, that is what happened to me in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.680
 college is touching on my experience 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.920
 it may be that in your faculty of design 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 graphic would be different and fla 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 central that what I experienced is good people 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.220
 good first period took a class 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 artistic drawing then the very thing 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.439
 important thing the teacher asked for is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.900
 those are a paper canson i think it is 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.549
 that the name paper canson that normally 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.840
 natural water of 150 and 180 to 200 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.579
 grams 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 so to the husband so to you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.320
 draws and usually at least 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.850
 in my college asking for the size a3 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.340
 so seeing a notepad so I think 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.159
 What's the cost of my time? 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.840
 cost a little over twenty reais 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.880
 It's more so you'll always be 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.619
 Saying in class and when it's over, will you? 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 need to buy a new one 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.549
 I also needed to buy pencils is 3b and 4b 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.619
 What is good for the drawing of the one to which 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.049
 I have something else very graphite 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.330
 important is a folder to 2 that the boy 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.880
 also money for you to take the materials 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.880
 this is very annoying nobody liked 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 center that took the folder at 2 to class is 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 because it's a thing that bothers still 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 but who worked because he had to go 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.470
 to work that huge band 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.660
 so this is important to assist 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.720
 other materials on my they say 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.640
 The city council also asked 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.550
 empathic that for those who do not know I think 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.880
 who does not have more but is a clay 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.550
 That's how you keep threatening her. 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.920
 hardens but you get a room with the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.930
 hand and she comes back normal I went out to 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.950
 break when you draw embu se 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.950
 delete 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.080
 celso wrong design to the moon that 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.020
 rubber sujeirinha ie catch 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.910
 Language like you are to you, it was not 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.550
 And we will not care, Brazil will fight. 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.490
 be careful you do not hand 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.410
 put a paper is the fingers not to 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.470
 mark the drawing then to clean 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.300
 dregs splits I get it on paper will 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 catch partly because it will stay but I walk 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.340
 and put the little ones in it to 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.200
 power to clean your drawing 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 another thing they also ask in class 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.400
 Artistic drawing is ruler is very 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.380
 important because you are going to draw 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.709
 geometric shapes 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.180
 So it's very important that we need 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.790
 I think in the artistic order 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.220
 basically this is no use talking like that 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.870
 anyone have some little thing itself 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.030
 but I think this is the most important 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.030
 it is clear that this faculty they can 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.940
 ask for something more or less 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.550
 so this one for you to have a base 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.070
 get an idea of what you need there in 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.500
 college time to cut in theory 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.989
 that you have to also use your folder 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.580
 2 do not need to buy another talent to 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.459
 same as you do drawing classes 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.860
 artistic you will use on the theory time 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.980
 body needs only one and you will 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.390
 need gouache paints 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.910
 usually the teachers they ask for 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.269
 gouache one more guy I do not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.950
 I remember the number one brand of the brand but 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.640
 it was much more fall 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.580
 is not that kind of $ 2 3 already and they 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.269
 always ask for five colors that this year 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.190
 magenta yellow black and white because 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.410
 these things you can transform 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.430
 in other colors in the theory class that 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.190
 that's right you even plant it is to mix 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.440
 colors and also clear princess is very 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.360
 important you are I think they do not 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.660
 ask the exit is thus a model 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.660
 specific you buy something so the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.080
 three women at the time bought for 317 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.960
 me 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.330
 I bought a medium fininho and the thickest 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.460
 to use it right there for you to put the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.770
 your ink you will need a 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.770
 ink pen them those 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:06.810
 understand that this is 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.690
 you have the administration is to have the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:15.630
 Yours then you need to buy more 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:23.970
 he will ask is maybe so will ask 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:24.570
 one learned a lot to fiddle with watercolor 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.520
 huh 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:40.289
 to do watercolor painting so I took 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:42.840
 you do not 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.520
 Good guys and that's what I 'll do 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.650
 basically it is echo more items 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.229
 significant is that we have to have 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.470
 in Graphic Design College if you 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.510
 It will start and it's this year college is not 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.190
 You end up in this video and leave. 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.229
 buying battery've talked right here 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.180
 because no one knows what your 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.979
 teacher or teacher will then ask 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.139
 this video is just for you to have an idea 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.860
 more or less of what you 're going to give 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.620
 That's what you're going to spend so 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.349
 let's say stuff is with an envelope to 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.320
 deliver work a xerox 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.850
 the notebook is for you to write 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.610
 so this is it, I really hope 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.620
 Once again you remember that 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.480
 this is my experience was what i 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.010
 I need my college does not want 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.030
 say you're going to need it all 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.770
 in your 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.380
 it may be that you need less or 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.060
 too right who knows will be angered by 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.530
 any doubt if you have any questions 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.050
 in this one in the comments that I 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.810
 to respond is to engage in the video clip 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.460
 I liked the favorite channel 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.380
 For whenever you leave again you stay 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.230
 knowing firsthand also disclose 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.790
 This video on Facebook on Facebook 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.770
 because this helps a lot 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.080
 growth of the channel to start the 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.770
 that is also always there in the 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.050
