00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.640 
beam connection
the<00:00:06.530> black<00:00:06.740> arrow<00:00:06.770> is<00:00:07.130> just<00:00:07.190> pointing<00:00:07.730> to<00:00:07.910> the

earthquakes<00:00:49.520> I<00:00:49.880> don't<00:00:50.180> know<00:00:50.239> how<00:00:50.450> many

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
earthquakes I don't know how many

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280

problems<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:52.520> building<00:00:53.030> has<00:00:53.239> survived<00:00:53.750> and

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
problems this building has survived and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.520 
problems this building has survived and
it's<00:00:55.010> still<00:00:55.309> fine<00:00:55.700> so<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.780> again<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:57.110> can't

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
tell you how many times I run into

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.229 
tell you how many times I run into
something<00:00:59.540> that<00:00:59.809> looks<00:01:00.050> like<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.860> wouldn't

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
something that looks like it wouldn't

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.620 
something that looks like it wouldn't
wouldn't<00:01:02.680> still<00:01:03.680> be<00:01:03.710> standing<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:05.000> so

do<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.290> really<00:01:06.470> need<00:01:06.830> all<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:07.880> framing

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
do you really need all of this framing

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.820 
do you really need all of this framing
hardware<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:09.710> guess<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.400> do<00:01:10.640> if<00:01:11.110> there<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.470> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
hardware I guess you do if there is a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.630 
hardware I guess you do if there is a
hurricane<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:15.200> know<00:01:15.320> an<00:01:15.500> earthquake<00:01:15.950> no<00:01:16.220> I'll

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
hurricane you know an earthquake no I'll

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.550 
hurricane you know an earthquake no I'll
tell<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.970> what<00:01:17.180> an<00:01:17.330> earthquake<00:01:17.510> there<00:01:18.290> have

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
tell you what an earthquake there have

tell you what an earthquake there have
been<00:01:18.799> plenty<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.400> buildings<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.940> just<00:01:20.180> rip

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
been plenty of buildings to just rip

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.850 
been plenty of buildings to just rip
apart<00:01:20.450> during<00:01:21.229> an<00:01:21.350> earthquake

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860
