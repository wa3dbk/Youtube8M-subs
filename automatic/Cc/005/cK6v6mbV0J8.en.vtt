transporter in the middle sonic hologram
are<00:02:06.560> there<00:02:07.549> are<00:02:07.849> kind<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.569> hidden<00:02:08.869> sort<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.709> not

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
are there are kind of hidden sort of not

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.860 
are there are kind of hidden sort of not
really<00:02:10.399> hidden<00:02:10.819> it's<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.239> that<00:02:11.359> the<00:02:11.450> stages

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
really hidden it's just that the stages

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.080 
really hidden it's just that the stages
layout<00:02:12.230> makes<00:02:12.500> them<00:02:12.709> bit<00:02:13.430> difficult<00:02:13.609> to<00:02:13.790> find

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
layout makes them bit difficult to find

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.150 
layout makes them bit difficult to find
because<00:02:14.900> you're<00:02:15.230> bouncing<00:02:15.620> around<00:02:15.680> half<00:02:16.069> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
because you're bouncing around half the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.800 
because you're bouncing around half the
time<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.639> you're<00:02:16.849> probably<00:02:17.030> flying<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:17.660> over

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
time so you're probably flying all over

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.330 
time so you're probably flying all over
the<00:02:17.930> place<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:18.200> knowing<00:02:18.650> what<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.190> to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
the place not knowing what the to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.690 
the place not knowing what the to
do<00:02:21.069> first<00:02:22.239> let<00:02:23.239> us<00:02:23.269> find<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:25.010> robot

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
do first let us find the robot

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.580 
do first let us find the robot
transporter<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.870> metal<00:02:27.440> sonic

to keep going up and here a little bit
more<00:02:58.870> no<00:02:59.870> wire<00:03:00.079> will<00:03:00.349> get<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> metal<00:03:00.859> sonic

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
more no wire will get to the metal sonic

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.740 
more no wire will get to the metal sonic
hologram<00:03:01.579> in<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.760> moment<00:03:02.060> or<00:03:02.239> just<00:03:02.540> let<00:03:02.660> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
hologram in a moment or just let the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.800 
hologram in a moment or just let the
back<00:03:02.900> track<00:03:03.109> for<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.410> that's<00:03:03.980> all

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
back track for that that's all

yeah<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:11.989> crusher<00:03:12.260> here<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:13.430> may<00:03:13.700> look<00:03:13.970> like

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
yeah this crusher here it may look like

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.300 
yeah this crusher here it may look like
it's<00:03:14.360> wanted<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.780> kill<00:03:15.020> you<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.770> fact<00:03:15.920> it's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
directly to the enemy row of a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.290 
directly to the enemy row of a
transporter<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.980> alright<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.550> that's<00:03:22.910> that

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
transporter here alright so that's that

transporter here alright so that's that
now<00:03:24.260> that's<00:03:24.620> actually<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.489> end<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:25.970> level

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
now that's actually the end of the level

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.690 
now that's actually the end of the level
over<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.720> my<00:03:26.870> left<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.590> we<00:03:27.860> are<00:03:27.950> wanting<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.370> go

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
over to my left but we are wanting to go

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.509 
over to my left but we are wanting to go
back<00:03:28.989> for<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.170> fact<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.650> Metal<00:03:31.340> Sonic

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
back for the fact that the Metal Sonic

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.949 
back for the fact that the Metal Sonic
hologram<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.390> think<00:03:32.780> up<00:03:33.050> here<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:35.750> just

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
hologram is I think up here and we just

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.180 
hologram is I think up here and we just
destroyed<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.470> as<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:38.330> saw<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:40.100> like

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
destroyed it as you saw so it's like

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.710 
destroyed it as you saw so it's like
right<00:03:40.640> here<00:03:41.260> right<00:03:42.260> by<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.440> feature<00:03:42.830> sign

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
right here right by this feature sign

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.880 
right here right by this feature sign
I'm<00:03:45.250> pretty<00:03:46.250> sure<00:03:46.489> this<00:03:47.170> alright<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.620> now<00:03:48.739> that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
I'm pretty sure this alright so now that

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.380 
I'm pretty sure this alright so now that
that's<00:03:48.980> done<00:03:49.160> let's<00:03:49.280> head<00:03:49.640> stina<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.090> level

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
that's done let's head stina the level

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.589 
that's done let's head stina the level
which<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.620> whether<00:03:51.620> weird<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.040> didn't<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:53.239> don't

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
which is whether weird I didn't I don't

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.750 
which is whether weird I didn't I don't
think<00:03:53.780> it'd<00:03:53.870> be<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.019> easy<00:03:54.250> thank<00:03:55.250> God<00:03:55.459> for<00:03:55.489> my

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
think it'd be that easy thank God for my

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.720 
think it'd be that easy thank God for my
list<00:03:56.060> uh<00:03:56.590> actually<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.920> might<00:03:58.400> be<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.580> bit

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
list uh actually this might be a bit

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.880 
list uh actually this might be a bit
tricky<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.299> yeah<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.230> kind<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.530> an<00:04:00.650> annoying
