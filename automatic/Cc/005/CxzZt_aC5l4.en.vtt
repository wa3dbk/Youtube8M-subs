shock that you can have is bringing a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.090 
shock that you can have is bringing a
vibration<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.350> engine<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.890> driving

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
vibration to the engine and driving

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.940 
vibration to the engine and driving
around<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:33.840> makes<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.560> run<00:03:34.740> a<00:03:34.770> lot

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
around so it just makes it run a lot

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.640 
around so it just makes it run a lot
smoother<00:03:35.400> than<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.900> adds<00:03:36.900> kind<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.350> just<00:03:37.500> some

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
smoother than it adds kind of just some

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.040 
smoother than it adds kind of just some
dirt<00:03:38.220> Bolivians<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.000> itself<00:03:39.300> well<00:03:39.930> you're

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
tension on we'll put on these two

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:14.270 
tension on we'll put on these two
bushings

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.249 

alright<00:04:16.650> ok<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:17.919> they're<00:04:18.070> pretty<00:04:18.280> scary

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
alright ok so they're pretty scary

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.360 
alright ok so they're pretty scary
should<00:04:20.259> be<00:04:20.380> good<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.560> go<00:04:22.139> that's<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.380> didn't

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
should be good to go that's it didn't

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.700 
should be good to go that's it didn't
take<00:04:24.490> me<00:04:24.639> long<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:32.110> actually<00:04:32.500> really

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
take me long and it's actually really

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:43.080 
take me long and it's actually really
sturdy

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.610 

by<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.940> there's<00:04:45.940> no<00:04:46.570> wobble<00:04:46.870> that's<00:04:47.350> pretty

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
by the there's no wobble that's pretty

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.000 
by the there's no wobble that's pretty
much<00:04:47.740> essentially<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.610> part<00:04:49.120> on<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.389> frame<00:04:49.660> now

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
much essentially a part on the frame now

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.560 
much essentially a part on the frame now
really<00:04:51.010> strong<00:04:51.280> really<00:04:51.880> really<00:04:52.090> strong<00:04:52.330> and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
really strong really really strong and

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.200 
really strong really really strong and
not<00:04:53.350> much<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:53.950> so<00:04:53.980> it's<00:04:54.280> not<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.760> much

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
not much to it so it's not that much

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.990 
not much to it so it's not that much
heavier<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:56.169> mean<00:04:56.889> there's<00:04:57.220> obviously<00:04:57.760> some
