00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
all of my twists I think that this is a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550 
all of my twists I think that this is a
really<00:02:26.550> easy<00:02:26.580> thing<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.209> do<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:27.840> midweek

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
once you've had your twist out I tend to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900 
once you've had your twist out I tend to
keep<00:02:31.230> my<00:02:31.290> twist<00:02:31.709> outs<00:02:31.920> between<00:02:32.370> nine<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.610> ten

keep my twist outs between nine and ten

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.449 
keep my twist outs between nine and ten
days<00:02:33.090> sometimes<00:02:33.480> even<00:02:33.810> longer<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.920> do<00:02:35.190> like

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
days sometimes even longer but I do like

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.309 
days sometimes even longer but I do like
to<00:02:35.640> wash<00:02:35.819> my<00:02:36.090> hair<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.420> Co<00:02:36.780> wash<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.140> hair

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
to wash my hair and Co wash my hair

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.680 
to wash my hair and Co wash my hair
often<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.850> getting<00:02:39.180> cold<00:02:39.450> I

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
often but now that it's getting cold I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
often but now that it's getting cold I
prefer<00:02:39.989> not<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.200> collage<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.890> often<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:41.580> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
prefer not to collage as often because I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.580 
prefer not to collage as often because I
don't<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.150> enough<00:02:42.480> time<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.900> let<00:02:43.080> my<00:02:43.260> hair

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
don't have enough time to let my hair

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.479 
don't have enough time to let my hair
dry<00:02:45.290> earlier<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> video<00:02:46.860> when<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.280> saw

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
dry earlier in the video when you saw

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.820 
dry earlier in the video when you saw
the<00:02:47.550> before<00:02:48.200> snippet<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.320> what<00:02:49.470> my<00:02:49.620> hair

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the before snippet of what my hair

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.440 
the before snippet of what my hair
looked<00:02:50.070> like<00:02:50.130> before<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:50.820> started<00:02:50.970> this

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
looked like before I got started this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.960 
looked like before I got started this
was<00:02:51.630> pretty<00:02:51.870> much<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.080> nine<00:02:52.470> day<00:02:52.830> old<00:02:52.860> twist<00:02:53.459> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
was pretty much a nine day old twist and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.130 
was pretty much a nine day old twist and
I'm<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.300> saying<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.720> could<00:02:55.050> have

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I'm not saying that I could have

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.470 
I'm not saying that I could have
continued<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.890> go<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.580> way<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> maintain<00:02:57.450> my

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
continued to go the way I maintain my

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.509 
continued to go the way I maintain my
twist<00:02:57.930> off<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.260> by<00:02:58.380> doing<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.800> process<00:02:59.310> that

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
twist off is by doing the process that

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.699 
twist off is by doing the process that
I'm<00:02:59.610> showing<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.090> midweek<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.230> then<00:03:01.440> also

every night I'll either pineapple my

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.960 
every night I'll either pineapple my
hair<00:03:04.080> or<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.709> simply<00:03:04.950> put<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.550> hair<00:03:05.790> into

I'm twisting it really well all the way
down<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> end<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.079> definitely

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
down to the end this is definitely

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:44.410 
down to the end this is definitely
important<00:03:23.640> for<00:03:23.700> refreshing<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.570> twist<00:03:24.900> out

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.960 

so<00:03:45.420> my<00:03:45.720> camera<00:03:45.960> died<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> have

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
so my camera died and this is all I have

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
twist nonetheless the next day I just

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.560 
twist nonetheless the next day I just
let<00:03:52.830> those<00:03:52.980> Swiss<00:03:53.250> stay<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.640> my<00:03:53.790> hair<00:03:54.000> all<00:03:54.210> day

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
let those Swiss stay in my hair all day

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.320 
let those Swiss stay in my hair all day
long<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.290> didn't<00:03:55.770> take<00:03:56.490> out<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.790> Swiss<00:03:57.030> until

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
long I didn't take out the Swiss until

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.790 
long I didn't take out the Swiss until
later<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.810> evening<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.410> wanted<00:03:58.650> to

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
later in the evening because I wanted to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.980 
later in the evening because I wanted to
make<00:03:58.950> sure<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.280> they<00:03:59.430> were<00:03:59.490> dry<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.660> had

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
make sure that they were dry and I had

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.510 
make sure that they were dry and I had
that<00:04:01.140> flexibility<00:04:01.740> because<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.160> didn't<00:04:02.370> go<00:04:02.430> out

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
that flexibility because I didn't go out

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.030 
that flexibility because I didn't go out
of<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.760> house<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.150> day<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:04.050> now<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.320> unravel

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
of the house that day but now to unravel

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.830 
of the house that day but now to unravel
them<00:04:05.190> I'm<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.520> taking<00:04:05.850> some<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:06.120> audience

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
them I'm just taking some of audience

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.110 
them I'm just taking some of audience
burnt<00:04:07.260> sugar<00:04:07.530> pomade<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.370> I'm<00:04:08.610> adding<00:04:09.000> that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
burnt sugar pomade and I'm adding that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.450 
burnt sugar pomade and I'm adding that
all<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.570> them<00:04:09.660> all<00:04:09.870> over<00:04:10.230> my<00:04:10.380> hair<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:11.130> smells

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
all of them all over my hair it smells

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.400 
all of them all over my hair it smells
very<00:04:11.550> scrumptious<00:04:12.060> by<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.420> way<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.290> I'm

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
very scrumptious by the way so I'm

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.350 
very scrumptious by the way so I'm
adding<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.800> all<00:04:14.010> over<00:04:14.280> my<00:04:14.460> hair<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:15.030> reduce

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
adding that all over my hair to reduce

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:31.460 
adding that all over my hair to reduce
frizz<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.080> increase<00:04:16.500> shine<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:31.080> now<00:04:31.320> of

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
frizz and to increase shine and now of

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.590 
frizz and to increase shine and now of
course<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.920> unraveling<00:04:32.520> process<00:04:32.940> begins<00:04:33.300> so

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
course the unraveling process begins so

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.060 
course the unraveling process begins so
I'm<00:04:33.660> just<00:04:33.840> going<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.050> go<00:04:34.230> through<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.830> take

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
I'm just going to go through and take

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.800 
I'm just going to go through and take
out<00:04:35.250> each<00:04:35.430> twist<00:04:35.760> as<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.450> see<00:04:36.630> they're

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
out each twist as you can see they're

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.020 
out each twist as you can see they're
coming<00:04:37.080> out<00:04:37.200> really<00:04:37.500> easily<00:04:37.800> they're<00:04:38.490> not<00:04:38.700> you

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
coming out really easily they're not you

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.380 
coming out really easily they're not you
know<00:04:39.150> hard<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:40.080> unravel<00:04:40.710> at<00:04:40.860> all<00:04:41.270> when<00:04:42.270> I'm

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
know hard to unravel at all when I'm

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.090 
know hard to unravel at all when I'm
unraveling<00:04:42.750> what<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.260> usually<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.070> go

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
unraveling what I usually do is go

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.970 
unraveling what I usually do is go
through<00:04:44.310> each<00:04:44.670> twist<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.510> unravel<00:04:46.110> once<00:04:46.620> and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
through each twist and unravel once and

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.040 
through each twist and unravel once and
