system<00:00:33.320> how<00:00:34.320> we'll<00:00:34.500> spread<00:00:34.829> out

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
system how we'll spread out

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.250 
system how we'll spread out
you'll<00:00:35.880> notice<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.540> spearmint<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:38.129> actually

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
you'll notice here spearmint is actually

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.799 
you'll notice here spearmint is actually
with<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> spear<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.250> leaf<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.660> why

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
with a spear like leaf and that's why

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
with a spear like leaf and that's why
they<00:00:42.960> call<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.170> spearmint<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:47.039> oil<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.969> this

they call it spearmint the oil when this

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
they call it spearmint the oil when this
is<00:00:48.300> produced<00:00:48.750> by<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> plant<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.800> stored<00:00:50.280> in
