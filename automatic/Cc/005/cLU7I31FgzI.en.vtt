it's just absolutely smoother than my
bike<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:23.090> weird<00:02:23.300> thing<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.570> me<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.990> I'm<00:02:24.650> losing

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
bike the weird thing to me is I'm losing

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.750 
bike the weird thing to me is I'm losing
my<00:02:25.010> voice<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.400> it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
my voice of it

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.550 
my voice of it
the<00:02:26.090> clip-ons<00:02:26.570> feel<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.140> they're<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> little

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the clip-ons feel like they're a little

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.680 
the clip-ons feel like they're a little
bit<00:02:27.740> bent<00:02:28.010> but<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:29.210> think<00:02:29.330> they<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.660> I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
bit bent but I don't think they are I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.480 
bit bent but I don't think they are I
think<00:02:29.870> it's<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.680> clip<00:02:31.100> bones<00:02:31.370> are

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
think it's just that the clip bones are

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.660 
think it's just that the clip bones are
is<00:02:31.580> sick<00:02:31.820> higher<00:02:33.160> one<00:02:34.160> thing<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.460> could<00:02:34.640> say

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.830 

where<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.110> might

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
where this might

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.929 
where this might
and<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.019> power<00:03:38.290> delivery<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.519> much

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
and that power delivery is so much

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.729 
and that power delivery is so much
incredibly<00:03:40.599> different<00:03:40.810> like<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.319> can't<00:03:41.590> even

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
incredibly different like I can't even

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.869 
incredibly different like I can't even

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
fathom there's not a certain point where

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.440 
fathom there's not a certain point where
like<00:03:46.090> holy<00:03:46.659> it's<00:03:47.230> more<00:03:47.469> like<00:03:48.450> smooth

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
like holy it's more like smooth

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.530 
like holy it's more like smooth
just<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.200> whole<00:03:50.379> time<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:50.920> just<00:03:50.980> smooth

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
just the whole time it's just smooth

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.679 
just the whole time it's just smooth
which<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.689> good<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.170> mean<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:54.700> real<00:03:54.909> nice<00:03:55.090> bike

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
which is good I mean it's real nice bike

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.340
