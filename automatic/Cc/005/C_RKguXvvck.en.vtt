00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
make decisions going full-speed so the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
number one reason that we press is we

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.140 
number one reason that we press is we

number<00:01:07.780> two<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.290> want<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.500> make<00:01:08.620> conditioning

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
number two we want to make conditioning

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.820 
number two we want to make conditioning
a<00:01:09.370> factor<00:01:09.970> we<00:01:10.420> practice<00:01:11.110> four<00:01:11.260> to<00:01:11.410> two<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.770> a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
a factor we practice four to two and a

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.950 
a factor we practice four to two and a
half<00:01:12.010> hours<00:01:12.310> there<00:01:12.670> are<00:01:12.700> intense<00:01:13.119> practices

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
half hours there are intense practices

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.710 
half hours there are intense practices
and<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.470> press<00:01:14.800> we<00:01:15.310> press<00:01:15.640> every<00:01:16.090> possession

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
and the press we press every possession

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.590 
and the press we press every possession
in<00:01:17.010> practice<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:18.460> it's<00:01:18.790> part<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.150> our<00:01:19.270> style

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
in practice so it's part of our style

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.719 
in practice so it's part of our style
and<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:20.050> think<00:01:20.320> that<00:01:20.680> conditioning<00:01:21.550> is<00:01:21.610> going

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
and we think that conditioning is going

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.490 
and we think that conditioning is going
to<00:01:21.790> play<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> factor<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.020> fourth<00:01:23.229> quarter

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
to play a factor in the fourth quarter

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.640 
to play a factor in the fourth quarter
we<00:01:24.310> are<00:01:24.430> going<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.640> press<00:01:24.970> press<00:01:25.479> press<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.320> it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
we are going to press press press and it

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.320 
we are going to press press press and it
may<00:01:26.830> not<00:01:26.979> be<00:01:27.040> highly<00:01:27.520> effective<00:01:27.790> until<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
may not be highly effective until you

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.850 
may not be highly effective until you
get<00:01:28.450> into<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.690> fourth<00:01:28.960> quarter<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.440> then

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
get into the fourth quarter and then

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.100 
get into the fourth quarter and then
that<00:01:30.010> other<00:01:30.190> team<00:01:30.490> melts<00:01:31.119> down<00:01:31.300> number<00:01:32.080> three

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.880 
this press it's it's simple it's
something<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:02.080> think<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.410> can<00:02:02.560> run<00:02:02.740> on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
something that we think you can run on

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.160 
something that we think you can run on
the<00:02:02.979> fourth<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.429> fifth<00:02:03.610> grade<00:02:03.819> level<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.960> want

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the fourth and fifth grade level we want

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.080 
the fourth and fifth grade level we want
it<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.470> as<00:02:05.590> simple<00:02:05.649> as<00:02:06.039> possible<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.700> then

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
it to be as simple as possible and then

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.320 
it to be as simple as possible and then
we<00:02:07.119> do<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.840> million<00:02:08.289> times<00:02:08.860> with<00:02:09.850> our<00:02:10.060> kids

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
we do it a million times with our kids

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.080 
we do it a million times with our kids
it's<00:02:10.780> very<00:02:10.899> similar<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.500> motion<00:02:11.890> offense<00:02:12.250> you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it's very similar to motion offense you

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.150 
it's very similar to motion offense you
have<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.420> make<00:02:13.540> reads<00:02:13.900> as<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.500> go<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.920> think

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
have to make reads as you go but I think

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.400 
have to make reads as you go but I think
they're<00:02:15.280> very<00:02:15.310> simple<00:02:15.880> reads<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.260> been

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
they're very simple reads and it's been

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.640 
they're very simple reads and it's been
very<00:02:17.440> effective<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.160> us<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.460> past
