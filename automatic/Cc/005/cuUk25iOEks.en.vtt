1080p<00:04:19.500> monitor<00:04:22.010> but<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.430> does<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.820> trick<00:04:23.850> i

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
1080p monitor but it does the trick i

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.460 
1080p monitor but it does the trick i
think<00:04:24.570> i<00:04:24.660> run<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.960> in<00:04:25.080> 1380<00:04:25.830> ba<00:04:29.210> 113<00:04:30.210> 280<00:04:30.480> x<00:04:30.690> 768

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
think i run it in 1380 ba 113 280 x 768

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.860 
think i run it in 1380 ba 113 280 x 768
resolution<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:32.340> was<00:04:32.430> really<00:04:32.730> good<00:04:32.880> i<00:04:33.180> think

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
resolution it was really good i think

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.650 
resolution it was really good i think
it's<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.050> little<00:04:34.140> bit<00:04:34.290> higher<00:04:34.560> than<00:04:35.660> 720p

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
it's a little bit higher than 720p

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.470 
it's a little bit higher than 720p
resolution<00:04:37.169> wise<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.520> white<00:04:38.700> streamers<00:04:39.000> and
