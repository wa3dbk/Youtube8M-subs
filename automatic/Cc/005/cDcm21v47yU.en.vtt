can't get knocked out for example like

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860 
can't get knocked out for example like
if<00:00:35.280> Shyvana<00:00:35.640> had<00:00:35.880> altered<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:36.510> she<00:00:36.690> was

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
if Shyvana had altered when she was

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
if Shyvana had altered when she was
trying<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> alt<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> Shyvana<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.820> knock

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
trying to alt the Shyvana it would knock

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
trying to alt the Shyvana it would knock
her<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.930> her<00:00:40.020> alt<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.410> cancel<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> which

her out of her alt and cancel it which

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
her out of her alt and cancel it which
was<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.640> weird<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
was really weird so they want to make a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.279 
was really weird so they want to make a
gameplay<00:00:44.190> change<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.120> their<00:00:45.360> reasoning

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
gameplay change this is their reasoning

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
gameplay change this is their reasoning
and<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> things<00:00:46.860> they've<00:00:47.100> come<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.370> with

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and the things they've come up with

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
and the things they've come up with
so<00:00:48.149> satisfaction<00:00:48.930> fiora<00:00:49.320> restores<00:00:49.920> 3%<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> her

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so satisfaction fiora restores 3% of her

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.250 
so satisfaction fiora restores 3% of her
missing<00:00:51.149> health<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.510> kills<00:00:51.809> Ares's<00:00:53.899> yeah<00:00:54.899> well

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
she it makes sense cuz right now how

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.369 
she it makes sense cuz right now how
hurry<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:59.480> resets<00:01:00.480> whenever<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
hurry works is like resets whenever you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
hurry works is like resets whenever you
get<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> kill<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.520> assist<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
get a kill or an assist and then you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
get a kill or an assist and then you
gain<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> huge<00:01:04.619> amount<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> movement<00:01:05.129> speed

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
gain that huge amount of movement speed

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.859 
gain that huge amount of movement speed
and<00:01:05.640> huge<00:01:05.850> amount<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> attack<00:01:06.420> speed<00:01:06.570> every

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and huge amount of attack speed every

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.870 
and huge amount of attack speed every
time<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> attack<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.460> goes<00:01:08.700> along

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
time you attack and then this goes along

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
time you attack and then this goes along
with<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.140> kills<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> misses<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.549> mid

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
with going for kills and misses so mid

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
with going for kills and misses so mid
game<00:01:12.119> teamfights<00:01:12.750> would<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.560> on

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
game teamfights would be really good on

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.590 
game teamfights would be really good on
fiora<00:01:14.450> 3%<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> her<00:01:15.600> missing<00:01:15.900> health<00:01:16.080> plus<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
fiora 3% of her missing health plus the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.940 
fiora 3% of her missing health plus the
mastery<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.740> 5%

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
mastery that you can get I think it's 5%

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
mastery that you can get I think it's 5%
missing<00:01:20.700> health<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> mana<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
missing health and mana or just in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
missing health and mana or just in
general<00:01:22.979> 5%<00:01:23.790> maximum<00:01:24.210> health<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.630> mana

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
general 5% maximum health and mana

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
general 5% maximum health and mana
so<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> whole<00:01:26.130> 8%<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.479> with

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
so that would be a whole 8% just with

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.469 
so that would be a whole 8% just with
the<00:01:27.750> mastery<00:01:28.170> plus<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.909> doulas<00:01:29.909> heart<00:01:30.150> fiora

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

anything<00:02:01.229> she<00:02:02.189> wants<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:02.969> it's

anything she wants pretty much it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
anything she wants pretty much it's
similar<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.810> Riven<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:04.710> she<00:02:04.860> has<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
similar to like Riven where she has the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.999 
similar to like Riven where she has the
one-and-a-half<00:02:05.549> second<00:02:06.000> shield<00:02:06.500> up<00:02:07.500> every

one-and-a-half second shield up every

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
one-and-a-half second shield up every
three<00:02:08.280> seconds<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.390> creates<00:02:09.959> these

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
three seconds so it creates these

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.650 
three seconds so it creates these
windows<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.649> opportunity<00:02:11.370> for

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660

windows of opportunity for

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
oh and then he goes Orly something
