red<00:01:07.170> design<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> stick<00:01:08.220> it's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
red design that's in the stick it's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
red design that's in the stick it's
gonna<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:08.700> soft<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.330> very<00:01:09.540> easy<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.140> load

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
gonna get very soft so very easy to load

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
gonna get very soft so very easy to load
when<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.619> taking<00:01:10.920> snapshots<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.549> wrist

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
when you're taking snapshots in wrist

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
when you're taking snapshots in wrist
shots<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> puck<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:12.930> quickly

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
shots to get the puck off very quickly

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
shots to get the puck off very quickly
it's<00:01:13.409> gonna<00:01:13.560> flex<00:01:13.830> easily<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> respond<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it's gonna flex easily and respond and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
it's gonna flex easily and respond and
recoil<00:01:15.540> quickly<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> crisper<00:01:17.159> feeling

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
recoil quickly with a crisper feeling

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
recoil quickly with a crisper feeling
blade<00:01:17.700> okay<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> rounded<00:01:19.229> shaft<00:01:19.530> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
blade okay also has a rounded shaft so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140 
blade okay also has a rounded shaft so
it's<00:01:19.860> gonna<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> different<00:01:20.400> feel<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.729> hand<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it's gonna be a different feel in hand a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
it's gonna be a different feel in hand a
little<00:01:21.299> bit<00:01:21.450> maybe<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.900> agile<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> puck

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
little bit maybe more agile for the puck

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.300 
little bit maybe more agile for the puck
handler<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.740> distinctly<00:01:25.740> different

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
handler so two very distinctly different

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
handler so two very distinctly different
